Erica Yee,It used to stand for vi imitation but now stands for vi improved,64,13,13:19:05
Ben Fickes,Iâve done nothing today so far,32,6,13:15:16
Ben Fickes,"Donât beat yourself up, I think itâs amazing you learn so much",66,12,13:15:11
Ben Fickes,But now you know its origins,28,6,13:14:54
Erica Yee,i don't even know how to use vim,32,8,13:06:50

Erica Yee,i just read an article on the origin of vim,43,10,13:06:22
Erica Yee,nice,4,1,13:06:17
Ben Fickes,Yeah you can kill everyone in outer worlds I think,50,10,13:04:08
Erica Yee,also that's interesting you can kill npcs at all,48,9,13:03:13
Erica Yee,i didn't play enough of outer worlds to know,44,9,13:03:04
Erica Yee,in life,7,2,13:02:47
Ben Fickes,In life or in outer worlds,26,6,13:02:09
Erica Yee,"When there are laws such as ""your ancestor did not kill domesticated animals""",77,13,13:00:39
Erica Yee,I feel like I would try to be but end up being neutral good,59,14,13:00:22
Ben Fickes,Because apparently she killed an npc for fun,44,8,12:55:22
Ben Fickes,I participated in some research study for Jennifer and part of it was taking a survey for your alignment and I got lawful good which is apparently rare among the participants? so she asked me âas a lawful good did you kill anyone in outer worldsâ,250,46,12:55:06
Ben Fickes,I feel like Iâm usually very quiet,36,7,12:53:50
Ben Fickes,A lot of people thought I was a different year,46,10,12:53:38
Erica Yee,What do you think your reputation is in amongst your game classmates,68,12,12:53:03
Ben Fickes,I probably did,14,3,12:46:36
Erica Yee,i think,7,2,12:46:30
Erica Yee,oh i remember you mentionign that,33,6,12:46:24
Ben Fickes,Or maybe thatâs just my takeaway,34,6,12:45:52
Ben Fickes,In the brief convo Iâve had with red (some sort of intro activity for capstone) she told me about her dnd campaign which sounds very anti religious,149,27,12:45:26
Erica Yee,they both just said java lol,28,6,12:44:50
Erica Yee,red is very passionate about hating blackboard,46,7,12:44:23
Ben Fickes,Dan is rumored to not know how to code,38,9,12:44:12
Ben Fickes,"I know Dan and Red, like I know who they are from class even though we have rarely spoken",89,19,12:44:03
Erica Yee,also didn't know we had a game science & design MS,50,11,12:44:01

Erica Yee,Noted,5,1,11:58:50
Ben Fickes,But relative to the whole movie,31,6,11:54:48
Ben Fickes,I guess not relative to âyou shall not passâ or âkeep your secretsâ,75,13,11:54:39
Erica Yee,Why are you sorry lol,21,5,11:54:37
Ben Fickes,Second breakfast is a relatively popular Lotr meme,50,8,11:54:24

Ben Fickes,*cs/game dev majors,19,3,11:47:55

Ben Fickes,Anyways Iâm gonna shower Iâll be back soon,46,8,10:48:32
Ben Fickes,You said it is okay youâre not married but that doesnât necessitate that it would be not okay if you were married,117,22,10:48:23
Erica Yee,That's what I said!,19,4,10:47:40
Ben Fickes,To my knowledge she is,22,5,10:45:46
Ben Fickes,"I think it would actually be not okay for us if you were married, might put some strain on our relationship",107,21,10:45:41
Erica Yee,Is she graduating?,18,3,10:45:01
Erica Yee,Also ok for us that I'm not married,35,8,10:44:57

Ben Fickes,Dang. Well you could prob email the prof if need be?,52,11,10:43:35
Erica Yee,Also Jennifer didn't present so maybe she dropped?,50,8,10:42:39
Erica Yee,Might have a 3rd team member and she doesn't know JavaScript tho so uh oh (other person doesn't know python),108,20,10:42:20
Erica Yee,Also web app is probably easier than mobile app,47,9,10:41:55
Erica Yee,"Professor wants ideas that are more ""critical"" to learning at northeastern and don't try to do many things at once",114,20,10:41:42
Ben Fickes,What makes you not want to do it now,36,9,10:38:40
Ben Fickes,Now thereâs someone else to blame if you get sick,51,10,10:38:35
Erica Yee,Regretting how much I invested in my hci idea I presented on today because I think I shouldn't do it now,104,21,10:38:17

Ben Fickes,My first instinct is to delete it,33,7,17:41:05
Ben Fickes,Which seems very bad,20,4,17:40:58
Ben Fickes,I have a file named private_key in my desktop,45,9,17:40:54
Ben Fickes,Sick Nasty,10,2,17:20:31

Ben Fickes,Well Iâm very glad,20,4,17:20:12
Erica Yee,of you,6,2,16:58:40
Erica Yee,"it's ok, i'm not feeling sick at all",36,8,16:58:39
Ben Fickes,Once again really sorry if I get you sick though,48,10,16:44:50
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,16:44:41
Erica Yee,wow i think this is a character building moment for you,55,11,16:31:39
Ben Fickes,Donât think Iâm gonna go to Lutheran group. Would like the free food but if Iâm contagious even a little sharing the food is the prime scenario to share germs,164,30,16:28:30
Ben Fickes,Nice haha glad you got out early and donât have extra hw,58,12,16:24:28
Erica Yee,And we already have hw due Tuesday,34,7,16:20:21
Erica Yee,"We just got out of class early because ""if I do this example right now, we'll finish chapter 2. And then that homework will be due next Thursday. If I save it for Tuesday, then hw will be due a week from Tuesday. Which do you want?"" Lmaoo",238,48,16:20:12
Ben Fickes,Glad to hear it :),18,5,15:46:04
Erica Yee,So I'm happy haha,17,4,15:45:33
Erica Yee,I simultaneously finished the hci assignment AND learned new stuff from lecture,79,12,15:45:31
Erica Yee,"I'm good, on break in stats",27,6,15:45:06
Erica Yee,Nice!,5,1,15:44:58
Ben Fickes,How are you doing,17,4,15:25:06
Ben Fickes,Finished mobile dev for the week!,33,6,15:25:02
Erica Yee,kk,2,1,13:43:45
Ben Fickes,Matt is leaving at 5:15,23,5,13:40:24
Ben Fickes,Okay if you need to leave early though feel free,48,10,13:40:18
Erica Yee,don't think i'm gonna feel like trekking out to big social gathering anyway so all good,87,16,13:39:38
Ben Fickes,We can try getting dnd done earlier? Could also start at noon,61,12,13:38:52
Erica Yee,there's a hangout at rachel's but don't think i can make it cuz it's at the end of d&d. so just texted abby to see if she's free otherwise,138,29,13:38:05
Erica Yee,ok hope you feel better and get work done,41,9,13:37:34
Ben Fickes,Not gonna go to class,21,5,13:30:40
Erica Yee,What did you decide,19,4,13:30:28
Ben Fickes,And no we plan but donât really do work if that makes sense,61,13,11:51:57
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Thatâs awesome!,28,4,11:51:44
Erica Yee,Omg Abby kraines is gonna be here this weekend I wanna see her,62,13,11:49:59
Erica Yee,Do you get work done there,26,6,11:46:04
Ben Fickes,Iâm debating whether to not go to capstone âto be safe about not getting anyone sickâ (but also because then I get three more hours to work),146,27,11:44:51
Ben Fickes,I do run,8,3,11:44:17
Erica Yee,But also you run,16,4,11:43:05
Erica Yee,Fun,3,1,11:42:58
Erica Yee,Hmm Probably? Also the melee combat was kinda jank but range was really run,75,14,11:42:54
Ben Fickes,Didnât you say it was fun but the story was bad?,50,11,11:39:14
Erica Yee,Oh I played that game actually,30,6,11:19:29
Ben Fickes,Which will hopefully make sense after the session,49,8,11:16:52
Ben Fickes,The pun was âHorizon Zero Dawnâ,35,6,11:16:40
Erica Yee,Ooh am intrigued,16,3,11:13:28
Erica Yee,Lol ok,6,2,11:13:12
Ben Fickes,But I can do a non pun,22,7,11:11:39
Ben Fickes,And the pun wouldnât make sense,33,6,11:11:27
Ben Fickes,Oh I was thinking a pun,23,6,11:11:17
Erica Yee,But ok no worries,17,4,10:58:00
Erica Yee,I wanted a tease haha,21,5,10:57:57
Ben Fickes,Something based on my story wonât make sense rn though,56,10,10:54:51
Erica Yee,I was thinking your story but whatever you want,47,9,10:50:47
Ben Fickes,Thematic to my story or to dnd in general,41,9,10:49:20
Erica Yee,Thematically ideally,20,2,10:45:42
Erica Yee,Can you name the d&d group chat pls,35,8,10:45:38
Erica Yee,Banged out both my nu sci and IV emails with the headache so hope they make sense lol,85,18,10:45:19
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,10:44:57
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry but glad itâs mostly gone,44,8,10:43:57

Erica Yee,Are we still meeting up?,24,5,13:51:27
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,11:37:15
Ben Fickes,Dang hope he gets back to you,29,7,11:17:43
Erica Yee,i emailed him,13,3,11:09:21
Erica Yee,need for assignment due tomorrow night,38,6,11:09:20
Ben Fickes,Was it urgent stuff you needed to know/help with?,49,9,11:06:09
Ben Fickes,Dang that stinks,16,3,11:05:54
Erica Yee,Just went to office hours but TA wasn't there ð,50,10,10:44:57
Erica Yee,Sad,3,1,10:44:27
Ben Fickes,Feel okay and itâs not super runny now but idk what couldâve caused it but me being sick,92,18,10:30:28
Ben Fickes,Had a pretty runny nose last night,34,7,10:30:12
Ben Fickes,So as a heads up thereâs a slight chance I might be sick,58,13,10:30:05
Ben Fickes,No worries haha Iâm gonna sleep too. Goodnight ð,53,9,0:28:45
Erica Yee,Night â¤ï¸,12,2,0:28:18
Erica Yee,We can talk about this later,28,6,0:28:11
Erica Yee,Sorry it's been a long day I'm kinda about to collapse lol,58,12,0:27:52
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,0:27:08
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure you could find a new job if you get one you donât like though,74,16,0:25:59
Ben Fickes,And I mean the same could happen to me,38,9,0:25:22
Ben Fickes,"For demiurge, remind me to talk to you about it tomorrow because I donât know but have thoughts",97,18,0:25:14
Erica Yee,Do you think there's any advantage if you reach out to demiurge now vs later in the semester (advantage in possibility of a job),128,24,0:23:26
Erica Yee,But eh it'll be fine,20,5,0:22:01
Erica Yee,I have a slight fear that we'll move somewhere else for my job and then I'll hate it lol,88,19,0:21:24
Erica Yee,"Thanks again, that means a lot to me",36,8,0:20:46
Erica Yee,Sorry was washing up,20,4,0:19:35
Ben Fickes,And all else equal leaves out that I do want to be in the same place as you and if youâre elsewhere I would take a job even if I like it a bit less to be with you,164,39,0:14:39
Ben Fickes,Okay I liked it but also I think I would be happy somewhere else too and I donât really have a point of comparison,116,24,0:13:55
Ben Fickes,Hold on I have thoughts haha,28,6,0:13:33
Erica Yee,I don't want to keep you from asking there then,47,10,0:13:18
Erica Yee,Ah,2,1,0:13:03
Ben Fickes,"This is assuming theyâd hire me which I do not think is a guarantee, depending on budget",90,17,0:11:14
Ben Fickes,But itâs tough because all else equal I really liked demiurge so why would I go for another small game company instead?,121,22,0:10:57
Ben Fickes,Right now itâs been big non game or regular game if that makes sense,70,14,0:10:26
Erica Yee,Yes I know which is why I offered to share my list lol,54,13,0:10:26
Erica Yee,For more?,9,2,0:10:09
Ben Fickes,And yeah I know applying does not mean accepting or interviewing just trying to plan to fight my worries haha,109,20,0:10:05
Erica Yee,Are you moving to non game companies then or still looking fornmoreM,68,12,0:10:05
Erica Yee,Except maybe the ones in Texas lol,34,7,0:09:38
Erica Yee,"But those are the places I'm planning on applying and any that I said ""ready to apply"" I would be happy with the role (disregarding people etc for now)",151,29,0:09:31
Ben Fickes,So if I just apply to âmore rnadomâ non big name places I can do it anywhere I guess,88,19,0:09:30
Ben Fickes,I guess my big thing is I mostly just know the big names but itâs hard to get positions at those,98,21,0:08:57
Ben Fickes,No but I havenât applied to many in general and Iâm thinking more and more about demiurge. And I think the only thing âin progressâ rn is apple,151,28,0:08:39
Erica Yee,I just don't want to overestimate my probability of landing somewhere before I even apply for sure let alone get interviews,123,21,0:08:24
Erica Yee,I guess I'm planning to apply to several in NY and DC fwiw,58,13,0:07:47
Erica Yee,You didn't apply to that many Boston did you?,45,9,0:07:22
Ben Fickes,Haha I figured I appreciate it,30,6,0:07:08
Erica Yee,Did not mean to shut down the convo LOL,39,9,0:06:53
Erica Yee,Oh lol your messages were delayed,33,6,0:06:47
Erica Yee,Ok I'm sleeping now,19,4,0:06:39
Ben Fickes,We can also talk another time ofc but wanted to ask,51,11,0:05:51
Ben Fickes,Because globe is your only Boston one right?,44,8,0:05:36
Ben Fickes,"Should I apply to more non Boston places, seriously",51,9,0:05:24
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing,18,3,0:05:11
Erica Yee,approximately in the order i plan to apply,42,8,0:04:11
Ben Fickes,My eyesight is pretty good Iâll try,37,7,0:03:24
Erica Yee,idk if you can see this well but https://www.notion.so/8d4297e20e0441d9af384c2a18aaccbb?v=a521a14bb6504a828231c457bde9c846,122,9,0:03:02

Erica Yee,oh wait sorry you're not dan,28,6,0:00:04

Ben Fickes,Should I look for more places in nyc besides Pivotal,52,10,23:58:55
Ben Fickes,Either is fine haha,19,4,23:58:45
Erica Yee,would it help you to see my job search table or just stress you out lol,71,16,23:58:28
Ben Fickes,Oh nice!,8,2,23:57:52
Erica Yee,Associate interactive developer,31,3,23:25:59
Ben Fickes,What position did you apply to,30,6,23:23:05
Ben Fickes,Dang wow,8,2,23:21:50
Erica Yee,Omg again with the weird coincidences. My mom asked if I would read the New Yorker  magazine cuz she saw a deal literally 5 mins after I applied to the job there. And I hadn't told her beforehand about the job (it opened yesterday),231,44,22:55:02
Erica Yee,Have nu sci at 8 (uh oh have to think of article topic),55,13,21:39:26
Erica Yee,Ok I'm free then,16,4,21:39:26
Ben Fickes,At latest,9,2,21:34:29
Ben Fickes,Capstone can only go until 1:30 I think,39,8,21:34:25
Ben Fickes,Idk after menâs group? Or between meeting with capstone and volunteering,74,11,21:34:17
Erica Yee,Uh like when lol,16,4,21:32:34
Ben Fickes,No pressure,11,2,21:30:58
Ben Fickes,Know Iâm busy for a lot of the day but would you wanna hang out or work together sometime tomorrow,100,20,21:30:52
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I know,16,4,21:30:33
Erica Yee,^not small talk,15,3,21:30:27

Erica Yee,Are you volunteering on Wednesdays now,38,6,21:30:10
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,21:27:15

Erica Yee,As last semester,16,3,21:26:04
Erica Yee,Is it the same ra,17,5,21:26:01
Ben Fickes,Basically the first thing she said is âdo you need anything?â And Jason and I were both like ânah weâre goodâ. But Matt engaged in small talk haha,156,28,21:25:09
Ben Fickes,Dan is still not back,21,5,21:24:22
Ben Fickes,Finished the meeting in 8 minutes,33,6,21:24:14
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:15:10
Ben Fickes,Jason said heâs supposed to only be tabling until 9? But Jason and I are the only two home haha,97,20,21:11:17
Erica Yee,And ooh nice,12,3,20:24:43
Erica Yee,Isn't dan tabling till the end of fair (9:30) lol,49,10,20:24:35
Ben Fickes,Postmortem was interesting for the end haha. Will tell you about it later,73,13,20:23:40
Ben Fickes,This is one just with our apartment,35,7,20:21:52
Erica Yee,What I thought the ra meeting happened already,46,8,20:07:19
Ben Fickes,"So may miss most of the talk, oh well",37,9,19:31:56
Ben Fickes,And I was gonna leave at like 8:20 to try to get back for an RA meeting at 9,76,19,19:31:47
Ben Fickes,This postmortem talk doesnât start until like 8,49,8,19:31:29
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð thatâs hilarious,28,4,19:31:08
Erica Yee,"""so Ben's a year younger?!?!"" ð",34,6,18:57:55
Erica Yee,Made slightly awkward conversation with Ian at LG and he didn't know I was a fifth year so was mind-blown when he found out,123,24,18:57:44
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,16:57:48
Ben Fickes,Whenever we meet up next you can have it,40,9,16:50:26
Ben Fickes,Youâre welcome haha,21,3,16:50:18
Ben Fickes,Donât get so AMPED up,23,5,16:50:12
Erica Yee,Seriously thanks haha,21,3,16:10:33
Erica Yee,But all POWER to you,20,5,16:10:24
Erica Yee,This seems like a NEGATIVE deal for me,38,8,16:09:41
Ben Fickes,Hope youâre not too SHOCKED by that,37,7,16:08:18
Ben Fickes,But Iâll have to CHARGE you,29,6,16:08:09
Ben Fickes,Okay you can,12,3,16:08:00
Ben Fickes,No way,6,2,16:07:57
Erica Yee,omg can i have one please,25,6,16:07:33
Ben Fickes,I do have AA!,13,4,16:06:23
Erica Yee,thanks for looking,18,3,15:56:55
Erica Yee,"no worries, i just need one so don't want to buy a pack but i'm going to target tomorrow",88,19,15:56:50
Ben Fickes,Iâll check on batteries later but gotta run now,49,9,15:55:45
Ben Fickes,Well at least they like your ideas!,35,7,15:55:20
Ben Fickes,Uh I have no idea honestly on the batteries,43,9,15:55:08
Erica Yee,"wow so a TA gave feedback on my HCI ideas and everyone got ""green"" except the sustainability app which got ""yellow"" and that's the one i thought was the best idea LOL",166,32,15:52:20
Erica Yee,Do you have any AA batteries by any chance,42,9,15:46:19
Erica Yee,No proxe this time,18,4,15:46:11
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,15:46:04
Ben Fickes,She is excited to table with you haha,37,8,15:37:51
Ben Fickes,Just ran into Katie,19,4,15:37:36
Ben Fickes,Thatâs actually incredible haha,33,4,15:37:28
Erica Yee,I feel bad tho cuz everyone else looks like they're paying attention (like theyre following along with the slides on their laptop),130,22,13:34:36
Ben Fickes,Iâm def gonna work on other stuff during imaginary worlds haha,64,11,13:32:24
Ben Fickes,Well thatâs good theyâre a good lecturer,44,7,13:32:12
Erica Yee,Stats professor is actually a pretty good lecturer. I'm just so bored with the content that I'm still tempted to work on other stuff during,139,25,13:30:18
Erica Yee,Yeah haha,9,2,10:38:43
Ben Fickes,And hopefully you wonât be alone wherever you go :),53,10,10:32:52
Ben Fickes,"Glad youâre not worried though, thatâs a plus",49,8,10:32:42
Ben Fickes,Yeah but thereâs no way to really hypothetically know,55,9,10:32:33
Erica Yee,"She said ""so you won't be alone and mommy won't be as stressed"" but honestly not that worried about feeling alone. Maybe it's naive to think so and I'll feel differently if I'm in the situation",193,36,10:23:35
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Does that make you happy/excited,41,7,10:11:59
Erica Yee,"Speaking of weird coincidences, right after I submitted the LAT app last night, my sister texted me randomly ""If you move to LA, I'll look for jobs there too""",158,29,10:11:16
Erica Yee,"I'm alright, at the gym rn",26,6,10:10:06
Erica Yee,HAHA omg,8,2,10:09:56
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today,23,5,10:02:46
Ben Fickes,Apparently your friend isnât the only one haha,48,8,10:02:36
Ben Fickes,The timing of this,18,4,10:02:28
Erica Yee,Oh yeah my friend in HCI is already complaining about Ferd's soft dev class lol rip,83,16,9:56:42
Erica Yee,Ooh hope they're not sick for Dan's presentation on Friday,58,10,9:56:18
Ben Fickes,I told dan itâs his fault,27,6,9:51:07
Ben Fickes,Dans 8 am was cancelled because his prof is sick,48,10,9:50:52
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð those are good convos, thanks for sharing",51,9,9:50:33
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,9:49:34
Erica Yee,"And then at ST last night
Emily: and we're having some real adults speak this semester
Everyone: ooooh
Nathalie: well sort of adults, like Sam Thomas",149,26,9:49:32
Erica Yee,LOL YIKES,9,2,9:48:15
Erica Yee,"*looking at a bad UI that looks outdated in HCI*
Student: was this actually used in real life?!
Prof: yep and don't worry, I'll also be showing similar student examples from my previous mobile dev classes",204,36,9:48:12
Erica Yee,Two funny conversations,23,3,9:46:49
Erica Yee,York,4,1,9:46:40
Erica Yee,Both in New yori,16,4,9:46:38
Erica Yee,I'm like 90% sure some of these senior dev positions are at newsrooms that don't have junior dev positions though lol,117,21,9:46:30
Ben Fickes,And yeah I would never apply to senior positions right out of college haha,74,14,9:28:12
Ben Fickes,Where at?,9,2,9:27:59
Erica Yee,Obviously I don't feel like I have to have every requirement to apply to something but I don't think I should/want to apply to senior developer positions lol,157,28,7:37:54
Erica Yee,I found two more to apply to yesterday that aren't senior positions,67,12,7:37:12

Erica Yee,"Like sorry I know I was THAT STUDENT who kept the class in slightly late, but I really needed to know the answer and not everyone here is already super knowledgeable about how music works!!",189,35,15:33:21
Erica Yee,"Then I had a question about something at the beginning of class but then there was no chance to ask, so I waited until the end of class and asked at 3:12. The Prof said ""good question"" and gave a super helpful answer (for me). But he went like 2 mins over time to answer it. And when I was walking out, I heard 2 classmates saying ""ugh I can't believe the professor took 10 minutes to explain (the question I asked)""",416,82,15:32:40
Erica Yee,But the content is soooo interesting and I'm mind blown (this is music class),77,14,15:30:21
Erica Yee,Dark classroom...was getting serious food coma. I know I was nodding off a little but then at one point near the end I felt super awake for the rest of class. So I'm scared I accidentally power napped or something,213,40,15:29:38

Ben Fickes,Yeah that does make sense,25,5,22:45:56
Erica Yee,Like there's no recruiting cycle  in journalism if that makes sense,67,11,22:45:43
Erica Yee,They had a need and guess they found someone to fill it,55,12,22:45:24

Ben Fickes,"I did think about talking about the dragon ball video games, because that was actually a huge inspiration for TSS world mechanics",129,22,11:43:39
Erica Yee,I changed your Snapchat name to kylo Ben and now it makes me laugh every time I see a notification,98,20,11:43:38
Ben Fickes,I thought about that but that would actually be incredibly obnoxious,68,11,11:42:58
Erica Yee,Power move do TSS or RW,23,6,11:42:27
Ben Fickes,"But idk if the world is really what intrigues me in the other one, I feel like itâs more of the plot",102,22,11:35:31
Ben Fickes,Because lotr is pretty basic,28,5,11:35:07
Ben Fickes,Iâm debating between lotr and Johnathan strange and Mr. Norrel,64,10,11:34:59
Ben Fickes,For designing imaginary worlds tomorrow weâre supposed to talk about a world we really like,93,15,11:34:41

Erica Yee,To everything,13,2,21:17:56
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,21:17:51
Ben Fickes,"I just peaked at spring break travel.  I need to know ideal dates & times. (ie Sat late afternoon) Not sure if u want to do stuff in Bos for a bit too, which is ok. 

MegaBus departs at 11:45 pm & is a 7 hr ride to Phil. On 2/28 itâs only $7.50 plus $2-$6 seat reserve fee.  But, itâs riding a bus overnight.  2/29 it bumps up to $42 + seat fee, still overnight. JetBlue has $49 flights & you have enough points that u could both fly free.  Another option is SW to BWI free with points. Amtrak is more than flights.  Iâm supposed to go to a conference in Balt night of 2/28 - 3:30 on 2/29, but I can work around whatever travel you choose. â¤ï¸",652,131,21:15:10

Ben Fickes,But this class does not seem to bode well for that,50,11,20:16:11
Ben Fickes,I'm hoping that means he won't go to the end all the time,57,13,20:16:03

Ben Fickes,he is explaining how you play Bloons now,40,8,20:10:24
Ben Fickes,Just from an irrational fear that it will override my mute and I'll blast some trailer to the whole class,105,20,20:09:23

Ben Fickes,so you wanna order when we meet up?,35,8,19:50:44
Erica Yee,but we need you to be less efficient,36,8,19:50:20
Erica Yee,oh i was sorta suggesting the efficient way,43,8,19:50:12
Ben Fickes,And we can just order together,30,6,19:49:36
Ben Fickes,Or is that needlessly efficient,31,5,19:49:31
Ben Fickes,do you want me to pick something out and one of us can place the order when my class lets out,93,21,19:49:24

Ben Fickes,As opposed to my worst,22,5,23:31:38
Erica Yee,Well I have a psychological aversion to lemon soo,49,9,23:31:32
Ben Fickes,Iâll use my best judgment,27,5,23:31:30
Erica Yee,Maybe just get the most basic thing on the menu,47,10,23:31:21
Erica Yee,Whatever you get (if you are able) will be fine I'm sure,56,12,23:31:14
Ben Fickes,Did it at least taste good,26,6,23:30:59
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð sorry to laugh at your pain,37,8,23:30:51

Erica Yee,You kinda know what I like right lol,36,8,23:29:46
Ben Fickes,If not thatâs fine haha,25,5,23:29:45
Ben Fickes,If that is the case (not sure it will be though) and there are multiple items on the menu do you have any preference,116,24,23:29:40
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good,14,3,23:29:34
Ben Fickes,So uh we might be just getting you to go from wherever we eat dinner,68,15,23:29:16

Erica Yee,"Ohh that would actually be much appreciated, thanks",51,8,23:17:38
Erica Yee,Oh that's good,14,3,23:17:10

Erica Yee,Excited but a little sad of course,34,7,23:02:26
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about going back,36,7,22:56:10
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad to hear that,23,5,22:56:04
Ben Fickes,Aw thatâs really good,23,4,22:56:00
Erica Yee,"(well after I prayed but we weren't done yet my dad snarkily asks ""was that all one sentence"" ð)",99,19,22:55:32
Erica Yee,Just had a good family prayer time,34,7,22:54:48
Erica Yee,Lol ok,6,2,22:54:42
Ben Fickes,Will tell you about it in person sometime,41,8,22:52:31
Ben Fickes,It describes itself as âeclecticâ which is a good word,58,10,22:52:23
Ben Fickes,"Just finished, honestly donât even know how to describe it",60,10,22:52:02
Erica Yee,Interesting,11,1,21:43:00
Erica Yee,LOL omg,7,2,21:42:56
Ben Fickes,Also had audience volunteers for part and Iâm fairly certain one of them is from demiurge,91,16,21:28:32
Ben Fickes,Part of the show was about 15 minutes of an actor talking about how he was religious (Muslim) until going to college when he âstarted readingâ and âlearnedâ all religions are false,188,32,21:27:36
Ben Fickes,"But overall not my favorite sorta, will explain in person",57,10,21:25:31
Ben Fickes,Itâs very interesting,23,3,21:25:12
Ben Fickes,Donât know exactly how I feel,31,6,21:25:07
Ben Fickes,Intermission for the show,25,4,21:25:00
Ben Fickes,Haha ð nice,14,3,21:24:54
Erica Yee,ð counting that way is a whole different story,49,9,20:21:27
Erica Yee,"Me: I'm so glad I got to finish the game, my favorite character didn't die!
Mom: what don't you control the character",117,22,20:21:17
Erica Yee,Omg Calvin got me wireless headphones too ðð tis the year,63,11,20:05:35
Erica Yee,ð¤·ââï¸,13,1,16:12:49
Ben Fickes,Wow way closer than I expected,30,6,16:11:01
Erica Yee,Of California,13,2,16:09:07
Erica Yee,"(it's history, art, natural history haha)",41,6,16:08:59
Erica Yee,I mean..you're not absolutely incorrect,39,5,16:08:26
Ben Fickes,"The areas of the Oakland museum are the oak, land, and Oakland areas",68,13,16:06:26
Ben Fickes,OH I understand now haha,24,5,16:06:09
Erica Yee,I have no idea what's at jfk,28,7,16:03:33
Erica Yee,Areas of the Oakland museum,27,5,16:03:28
Erica Yee,LOL sorry I meant if you visited the Oakland museum,51,10,16:03:15
Ben Fickes,Or maybe I just moved through it really fast,44,9,15:41:36
Ben Fickes,Wasnât much legacy stuff though,33,5,15:41:27
Ben Fickes,"Uhhh I think maybe pre-president, president, and legacy? Idk there werenât really labels",90,13,15:41:20
Ben Fickes,Interestinggggg,15,1,15:40:55
Erica Yee,Wow what are the three areas of the museum then,47,10,15:39:56
Erica Yee,It's called descender and I've had it on my list for years and finally got it (since I get graphic novels when I go to the library in person). Complex sci-fi world but the humanoid characters look asian-y which I'm into. One of the main characters is a robot child companion who's like trusting kid himself (but kinda badass) and he's so cute,342,63,15:39:46
Ben Fickes,I actually traveled to Oakland this break and didnât tell you because I wanted to spend all my time in that museum,116,22,15:37:45
Erica Yee,Well you guys haven't been to the Oakland museum ð,53,10,15:37:10
Ben Fickes,Also with some stuff before he became president,47,8,15:36:48
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,15:36:34
Ben Fickes,Well my mom just informed the entire car that you havenât been to the jfk museum,82,16,15:36:32
Erica Yee,Like about jfk,14,3,15:36:29
Erica Yee,Is it history,13,3,15:36:19
Ben Fickes,Oh wow that is neat! Whatâs it called and about,49,10,15:34:51
Ben Fickes,Thatâs what stuck out to me,29,6,15:34:37
Ben Fickes,"Uh a lot of short videos of speeches, some transcripts of them",62,12,15:34:31
Erica Yee,Oh I also started a graphic novel this morning LOL what is wrong with me. Cuz I checked it out of the library so need to finish it. It's sci-fi but this gorgeous watercolor art which is really neat,197,39,15:32:44
Erica Yee,What are the exhibits,21,4,15:30:06
Ben Fickes,Sorta short but honestly I donât like long exhibits haha,58,10,15:29:14
Ben Fickes,It was pretty good! $12 for college students and only $6 if itâs a college in Boston. Good video at the beginning and I liked the exhibits too,144,28,15:28:58
Erica Yee,Ooh how is the JFK museum? Is it worth? Never been,50,11,15:19:23
Erica Yee,It's ok. He's very funny but his story is very sad,50,11,15:19:09
Ben Fickes,What do you think of that so far,32,8,15:18:35
Erica Yee,Also randomly reading Trevor Noah's memoir cuz I needed to test if a library card was not expired and it was the first book on the catalog page,143,28,15:18:17
Erica Yee,The Asian Canadian experience is pretty relatable,49,7,15:13:58
Erica Yee,No I definitely like it a lot,29,7,15:13:29
Ben Fickes,And wow that is interesting. Do you still enjoy reading it or is it heavier than youâd like?,94,18,14:46:52
Ben Fickes,Thanks for the correct spelling haha,36,6,14:46:34
Erica Yee,I thought it would be a light fluffy romance and it is sweet and funny but there's actually serious #metoo stuff which is interesting,133,24,14:03:33
Erica Yee,I started the durian romance book I think I told you about and it's basically a love letter to Asian desserts. The main character works at an Asian ice cream shop and literally every date (well fake date that ooh maybe could be real??) Is at a different Asian dessert place. Idk how they can eat so much dessert,311,59,14:02:38
Erica Yee,Chartreuse..,12,1,13:58:28
Ben Fickes,Thatâs my instinct,20,3,13:58:23
Ben Fickes,I have a feeling there are no zeroes in the actual spelling though,66,13,13:58:19
Ben Fickes,No I donât haha,17,4,13:58:04
Erica Yee,If I'm thinking of the same one,31,7,13:54:38
Erica Yee,Wait do you actually know how to spell that color lol,53,11,13:54:29
Ben Fickes,Sartr00ce is a color,20,4,13:42:27
Ben Fickes,T00th,5,1,13:42:05
Erica Yee,Tr00th,6,1,13:31:49
Ben Fickes,Wow I have never seen that before,33,7,13:29:57
Erica Yee,R00d,4,1,13:16:55
Ben Fickes,So I used my spells to level up,31,8,12:45:58
Ben Fickes,And saw that I was about to die,31,8,12:45:51
Ben Fickes,But I went on yesterday to get credit for applying to jobs haha,63,13,12:45:45
Ben Fickes,I havenât been on in forever,30,6,12:45:29
Erica Yee,Dang I thought I caught up to you in habitica but you're still a level ahead,76,16,12:45:17
Erica Yee,Seriously lol,13,2,12:44:26
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð wow thereâs one job you could take after college if all else fails,78,15,12:39:43
Erica Yee,"So at the gym and everytime to connect to the wifi you have to input an email. All these years I've been inputting a fake one, but accidentally clicked the submit button before typing anything and it STILL LET ME IN. Bruh client side form validation is so easy what are you doingggg",282,53,12:38:26

Ben Fickes,Thatâs extra suspicious,25,3,12:09:26
Ben Fickes,Wait no one even accused her directly,37,7,12:09:16
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry,16,3,12:08:51
Erica Yee,Off to a good start already lol,31,7,11:33:43

Erica Yee,"Just gonna give it my best shot, send a thorough email and see what happens",75,15,23:45:41
Erica Yee,But maybe not idk,17,4,23:45:14
Erica Yee,Ok after looking at the projects more in depth I think I actually could do more than I originally thought,105,20,23:44:43
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about the globe,35,7,23:34:09
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica I appreciate it :),31,6,23:33:58
Erica Yee,It's good you let him know,26,6,23:29:31

Erica Yee,Ohh,3,1,23:29:07
Ben Fickes,But yeah I emailed him,22,5,23:27:33
Ben Fickes,So I hope heâs not upset or disappointed,42,8,23:27:25
Ben Fickes,Feel bad because I never mentioned during our talk that I applied (because honestly I forgot I did),99,18,23:27:15
Ben Fickes,I emailed back and let him know,31,7,23:26:46
Erica Yee,Is there another one you can just apply to instead? Or let the friend know about the third one?,95,19,23:24:06
Erica Yee,Ohh,3,1,23:24:06
Ben Fickes,Sooo for google I applied to a stadia position in CA and the Cambridge one. But when I went to apply to the CA software dev (regular) one Iâm locked out bc I applied in November. And it doesnât have the recommendation. So idk whatâs gonna happen...,254,47,23:17:36
Erica Yee,Okkk thanks,11,2,23:16:24
Ben Fickes,Like I feel like this is a great way to communicate youâre a hard worker etc even if you donât have experience leading teams,128,24,23:13:59
Ben Fickes,I donât think thatâs arrogant for a job applying related scenario haha,74,12,23:12:59
Erica Yee,And this is probably a little arrogant but I feel like I need to stand out so actually made a little mock-up of how i would've designed it differently to better feature a part I thought was super cool,200,39,23:12:31
Ben Fickes,Oh was wondering what that was about,36,7,23:12:18
Erica Yee,I snapped this but for globe I'm supposed to discuss if I would've handled one of the projects he sent differently,114,21,23:11:25
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,23:10:18
Ben Fickes,About to finally actually apply for google stuff,48,8,23:09:30

Erica Yee,eek,3,1,16:22:24
Ben Fickes,That I now cannot take because of capstone on Thursday...,57,10,16:19:57
Ben Fickes,The mobile one,14,3,16:19:45
Ben Fickes,Nooo that ones the same time as my other course,47,10,16:19:41
Erica Yee,ok cool yw,10,3,16:19:04
Erica Yee,there's one seat,16,3,16:18:57
Erica Yee,that actually sounds useful,27,4,16:18:49
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much for your help seriously :),44,9,16:18:15
Ben Fickes,I didnât see the 4000 section of pdp,38,8,16:18:00

Ben Fickes,Like other options or what else am I taking,43,9,16:15:25
Erica Yee,wait so what are the others you have rn,39,9,16:15:06
Ben Fickes,Thereâs literally nothing else though,39,5,16:13:35
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,16:13:28
Erica Yee,i'm just saying,15,3,16:13:22
Erica Yee,i know,6,2,16:13:21
Erica Yee,doubt it helpfully inform cs stuff you haven't learned about,60,10,16:13:20
Ben Fickes,Donât wanna take discrete now,31,5,16:13:17
Erica Yee,only half joking,16,3,16:13:04
Erica Yee,hoenstly discrete might be more helpful for you LOLOL,53,9,16:13:02
Ben Fickes,What do you doubt,17,4,16:12:49
Erica Yee,i highly doubt,14,3,16:12:23
Ben Fickes,I have no idea what else there is,33,8,16:11:30
Ben Fickes,Okay thanks,11,2,16:11:13
Ben Fickes,But it is generally informative (like cs stuff I havenât learned a ton about),79,14,16:11:10
Erica Yee,so i have a feeling it will just be a class you complain about lol,66,15,16:10:38
Ben Fickes,Yeah donât think itâs very useful for what I have to do,59,12,16:10:37
Erica Yee,"and although it's not that difficult, it's not an insignificant amount of work, espeically for the final project",112,18,16:10:10
Erica Yee,but the class is pretty boring and probably useless based on what you want to do (actually idk what's required for your stuff so maybe not). cuz it's like ...  a person can have one address but several phone numbers! oh no how do you implement that,248,47,16:09:43
Ben Fickes,Thatâs good,13,2,16:08:29
Erica Yee,she's actually a good prof,26,5,16:07:47
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,16:06:05
Erica Yee,is the prof kathleen durant?,28,5,16:06:01
Ben Fickes,Do you not recommend the class because itâs too boring,56,10,16:05:58
Erica Yee,i know this is an unfortuante situation,39,7,16:05:34
Ben Fickes,Thank you for the addition haha,31,6,16:05:32
Erica Yee,sorry i've been thinking about reddit too much,46,8,16:05:27
Ben Fickes,Yeahhhhhh,9,1,16:05:27
Erica Yee,_this post was sponsored by the discrete structures gang_,57,9,16:05:18
Erica Yee,ohh yikes haha,14,3,16:04:29
Ben Fickes,"So like if someone actually looks, yes. But possibly not",56,10,16:03:32
Ben Fickes,But my advisor is new and I kinda think he just checked off discrete because I said I tested out,96,20,16:03:16
Ben Fickes,Iâm *supposed* to take an upper level cs course to replace me testing out of discrete,87,16,16:02:43
Erica Yee,yeah,4,1,16:02:42
Ben Fickes,Sooooo hereâs the deal,24,4,16:02:07
Ben Fickes,You moderately donât recommend dd?,36,5,16:02:01
Erica Yee,i moderately do not recommend taking this your senior year lol,62,11,16:01:31
Erica Yee,do you have to take a cs class?,31,8,16:01:24
Ben Fickes,Oh well will give me more time I guess,38,9,16:00:30
Ben Fickes,So not really haha,18,4,16:00:20
Ben Fickes,I learned it barely in hs,25,6,16:00:16
Erica Yee,but don't you already know sql,30,6,15:59:35
Erica Yee,uhh i guess dd is good if you want an easyish class,51,12,15:59:31
Ben Fickes,Machine learning is a grad class so Iâd have to get special permission from idk whom,86,16,15:56:00
Ben Fickes,Might try to switch into another class but thereâs basically nothing open,75,12,15:55:37
Ben Fickes,So now Iâm taking database design instead of mobile dev (sigh). No longer have Wednesdayâs off and have a Monday morning class instead of nothing until 6,157,27,15:55:22
Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,15:07:06
Ben Fickes,Matt and Jason get back tomorrow,32,6,14:49:34
Ben Fickes,Nope,4,1,14:49:27
Erica Yee,Is anyone else back,19,4,14:45:29
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,14:45:29
Ben Fickes,Made it back to my dorm,23,6,14:39:14
Erica Yee,thanks,6,1,14:05:11
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope it goes well. And hope it doesnât stress you out (though I know saying that doesnât help),106,19,14:01:29
Erica Yee,then will hopefully reply to globe email and start applying to other jobs,73,13,13:48:49
Erica Yee,currently figuring out how to present my capstone on my online portfolio,72,12,13:48:35
Ben Fickes,I assume you did,16,4,13:48:08
Erica Yee,yess,4,1,13:47:57

Ben Fickes,What are you up to today?,25,6,13:45:02
Ben Fickes,And thanks for the observation haha,35,6,13:44:57
Ben Fickes,4 minutes to spare haha,23,5,13:44:43
Ben Fickes,Sorry for the late reply was beating ebitan,43,8,13:44:37
Erica Yee,"sorry diff subject but read your music email, thanks. re the ""romantic"" dance that's something i think a lot when non-christian people/groups do christian christmas songs..they don't really try to match the lyrics lol",217,34,13:18:39
Erica Yee,sad,3,1,13:17:23
Ben Fickes,Yeah idk why they changed the prof halfway through and also why they waited so long to tell us that a section was being cancelled,129,25,13:12:19
Erica Yee,ohh ok,6,2,13:07:06
Erica Yee,"and oh yeah i didn't mean not take it, more like it'll be different with a new prof who doesn't know what you guys have done so far",131,28,13:07:03
Ben Fickes,"The cs one I chose, the mobile and wireless one",47,10,13:06:54
Erica Yee,what's the conflicting class,28,4,13:06:37
Ben Fickes,Checking with new prof about if weâre meeting or not,54,10,13:04:00
Ben Fickes,Like officially take it,23,4,13:03:48
Ben Fickes,"Probably not, think we need to take the class",45,9,13:03:39
Ben Fickes,Because of a sorta error I think I could actually graduate only taking three courses this semester so worse comes to worst I can drop the class it conflicts with. But Iâd like to replace it with another cs one if any are still open,233,45,13:03:04
Erica Yee,do you think your group can be self-disciplined/independent,59,8,13:02:24
Ben Fickes,Oh well,7,2,13:02:01
Ben Fickes,Dang this is such a mess,24,6,13:01:59
Erica Yee,oh wha?! dang,13,3,13:01:31
Erica Yee,ooops sorry yeah,16,3,13:01:25
Ben Fickes,So I have no idea whatâs going on,35,8,12:55:29
Ben Fickes,Just found out (email sent a couple minutes ago) that we have a new professor as well for the class...,102,20,12:55:22
Ben Fickes,Well guess itâs good you had stuff to (sorta) talk about for so long. And is loop autocorrected kpop haha,107,20,12:54:57
Erica Yee,Also learned that I was the one who introduced my teacher to loop. I brought over sheet music I downloaded and then she later gave that music to other students who got into kpop too haha,186,36,12:11:58
Erica Yee,"Dinner last night was 3 hours...I started yawning 2 hours in and got a small headache, then the restaurant kicked us out lol. But I guess it was good catching up even though it was so long. My mom likes mentioning every single co-op and my study abroad and by the end I was barely giving detail cuz I felt so exhausted.",319,62,12:10:48
Erica Yee,That would suck if you had to change and then capstone doesn't even meet anyway lol,83,16,12:08:26
Erica Yee,Oh whaa,7,2,12:08:01
Ben Fickes,Unrelatedly they just got rid of the morning section of capstone. I have class in the afternoon on Thursday so unless Kellian can override it I have to change my schedule again,176,32,8:04:08

Ben Fickes,Iâll look into it,19,4,20:20:38
Ben Fickes,Would also be good on a resume,30,7,20:20:35
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs good,16,3,20:20:29
Erica Yee,"I took a 5 sec look and there appears to be ""new college grad"" engineering jobs",79,16,20:20:06
Erica Yee,If you want!,12,3,20:19:47
Ben Fickes,"I can look into it, worried I donât now enough graphics stuff but maybe",73,14,20:18:09

Ben Fickes,"Then two regular soft Dev, one in Cambridge and one thatâs one of various places in CA",88,17,20:11:37
Erica Yee,"""my gf played the stadia beta and it looked cool il guess""",58,12,20:11:21

Ben Fickes,Are you sure youâre not getting it? I feel like you have a shot,65,14,20:09:54
Erica Yee,the rotational?,15,2,20:09:27
Erica Yee,not getting this job..but if i woudl be the only one there i don't want it anyway,81,17,20:09:26
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you where the locations of the google jobs I applied to are,70,15,20:09:09
Ben Fickes,Ofc!,4,1,20:08:51
Erica Yee,yeah thanks for helping me process through this haha,52,9,20:08:14
Ben Fickes,Like I feel like you shouldnât lie obviously and donât say yes if you canât. But maybe itâs worth highlighting youâd be willing to lead if you have guidance? Idk not that you donât know all of this haha,214,39,19:53:04
Erica Yee,"like i could see myself in charge of the project, but i still need someone right there i could go to all the time for ideas and help",132,28,19:49:54
Erica Yee,probably could if I had mentorship,34,6,19:49:21
Erica Yee,for production,14,2,19:49:05
Erica Yee,definitely could not learn on my own at real-life development pace,66,11,19:49:02
Ben Fickes,Do you feel like itâs something you could âlearn to doâ if that makes sense or would you just not want to have anything with that much decision making as your first job,174,33,19:47:47
Ben Fickes,Dang wow that sounds like a lot. Also a lot of responsibility,61,12,19:46:28
Erica Yee,uh definitely not lol but idk if i should say that..,52,11,19:44:57
Erica Yee,"so the globe guy sent me some projects they did and wants me to answer: ""Would you feel comfortable as the lead developer conceiving and executing projects of this scale and skill level? """,188,34,19:44:43
Erica Yee,kk thanks,9,2,19:44:11
Ben Fickes,"Eh either way, Iâll read it on the car ride tomorrow, I can listen if you send songs if there are any, and if there arenât any thatâs fine too",148,30,19:42:25
Ben Fickes,Yeah I know what you mean haha,30,7,19:41:08
Erica Yee,"I'm listening to your email rn, want me to not send songs since you're going back to Boston and will be busy?",109,22,19:39:09
Erica Yee,"Ok maybe ""super Christian"" is not the right word lol but I think you know what I mean",85,18,19:38:17
Ben Fickes,Yeah I just said Iâd watch,28,6,19:38:15
Erica Yee,Don't wanna come off as super Christian (although like.. I am) but can usually get out of it when invited,105,20,19:35:21
Erica Yee,Yeah I highly dislike it lol,28,6,19:34:29
Erica Yee,Oh really??,11,2,19:34:23
Ben Fickes,Because I have never met someone else who has said they donât like it,71,14,19:33:06
Ben Fickes,"Okay for some reason makes me feel better you donât like it either, thanks",76,14,19:32:53
Erica Yee,Hopefully they'll play something else,37,5,19:27:30
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I don't like that game,30,7,19:27:30
Ben Fickes,Donât wanna come off as snobby but just donât really enjoy playing,70,12,19:21:34
Ben Fickes,Friends are playing cards against humanity but I donât really want to,71,12,19:21:15
Erica Yee,Thank you for your kind words,29,6,18:59:35
Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâm sorry about the burger. And oooh looking forward to hearing about them!,83,15,18:54:17
Erica Yee,Oh also have 2 very small stories childhood stories my family told me about to tell you in person. Halloween and reading in cars,128,24,18:23:55
Erica Yee,Also in n out got my order wrong and put tomatoes in and thought I took them all out but nope so my burger was a bit ruined lol,127,29,17:44:06
Erica Yee,Oh yeah but I never have enough money or stones for main team anyway so now I don't have to upgrade them necessarily,116,23,17:38:19
Ben Fickes,I keep my beyondering team around for survival mode purposes,60,10,17:35:54
Erica Yee,LOL very nice,13,3,17:35:46
Erica Yee,Should I just abandon my beyondering team now,45,8,17:35:34
Ben Fickes,This is a pic of me josh stealth took during dnd haha,53,12,17:34:59
Ben Fickes,But alas,8,2,17:34:40
Ben Fickes,I know stingy is an understatement,34,6,17:34:38
Erica Yee,I got 1 shard for finishing five survival runs..why so stingy,61,11,17:34:17
Ben Fickes,Three starring a stage with no character shards gives me no character shards and costs energy I could use to get character shards,129,23,17:33:55
Ben Fickes,The achievements give me sonic shards which I need,50,9,17:33:25
Erica Yee,The achievements matter more to you than the unfilled stars,59,10,17:29:08
Erica Yee,Wow let's psychoanalyze that,28,4,17:28:46
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! I beat it but havenât three starred because no more achievements for three starring left haha,104,18,17:26:14
Erica Yee,Three starred beyondering,25,3,16:32:08
Erica Yee,No worries just wanted to make sure you have it haha,52,11,15:55:25
Ben Fickes,Sorry,5,1,15:54:37
Ben Fickes,Whoops I somehow missed that,28,5,15:54:35
Ben Fickes,Just wear all your clothes at once,34,7,15:54:20
Erica Yee,Wait isn't the flight number in the pic,39,8,15:54:18
Erica Yee,Delta I think,13,3,15:54:11
Erica Yee,Idk how I'm gonna fit everything I bring back in my carry-on lol,64,13,15:54:06
Ben Fickes,What airline,12,2,15:54:00
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey,9,1,15:53:32
Erica Yee,No checked luggage,18,3,15:50:35
Erica Yee,Oh yeah thanks,14,3,15:49:06
Erica Yee,Perhaps if you want to play in a different room,47,10,15:48:59
Ben Fickes,Also my mom was wondering if you could send her or me your flight info for Sunday,81,17,15:46:41
Ben Fickes,To clarify that is pure guesswork,33,6,15:45:23
Erica Yee,Interesting,11,1,15:44:08
Ben Fickes,Uhhhh maybe if you share a computer with someone?,49,9,15:34:15
Erica Yee,Ok journalist,13,2,15:25:00
Erica Yee,But why would you want to play your PC games on your phone at home when you have your expensive rig right there anyway,118,24,15:24:01
Erica Yee,Like you can play games you have on your home PC setup on your phone through local wifi (so not streaming),106,21,15:22:57
Erica Yee,Can you explain the desired use case of the steam link app,58,12,15:22:18
Ben Fickes,What if through incredibly terrible miscommunication between us I thought you were a games major and that you would make me video games one day,143,25,15:20:55
Erica Yee,Just thought I recognized it while watching a best apps/games of the year video,79,14,15:19:48
Erica Yee,Tho you are,11,3,15:19:29
Erica Yee,Lol jk,6,2,15:19:27
Erica Yee,I thought you were the games guy,32,7,15:19:24
Ben Fickes,How come?,9,2,15:12:31
Ben Fickes,Sounds plausible but honestly have no idea,42,7,15:12:23
Erica Yee,Was it called another Eden,26,5,15:08:55
Erica Yee,Remember when we went to Amy's apartment and her roommate showed us the mobile game she was playing,99,18,15:08:51
Erica Yee,Np thanks for reading it all,28,6,14:04:59
Ben Fickes,Iâll talk to my mom about spring break,40,8,13:47:40
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing the dream and post haha. Sorry for the late reply I was out running,86,17,13:47:34
Erica Yee,"To pile more on you as usual, just wanted to share what I posted on ig from hiking",82,18,13:13:44
Erica Yee,Also at the same time I needed to pay the bill I was baking a chocolate cake for some unknown reason but didn't have time to put it in the oven and turn it every 5 mins (where does my mind coming up with these things) so my mom offered,235,50,12:52:11
Erica Yee,"Anyway I would ofc happily come back to California for spring break if your family wanted to visit, so lemme know",113,21,12:42:54
Erica Yee,Just overall extremely stressful,32,4,12:41:00
Erica Yee,And I couldn't leave until I paid the bill LOL,46,10,12:40:27
Erica Yee,"I'm losing it but it involved getting to a fair or something that was two hours away where I/the main character promised to help this girl, but then we hear that suddenly she's in the hospital which is worrying",210,39,12:40:06
Erica Yee,Wow your dream sounds so much better lol,40,8,12:38:06
Ben Fickes,Like what happened in it,24,5,12:37:43
Ben Fickes,What was the main dream,23,5,12:37:38
Ben Fickes,I had a dream I came back to school and I had a new roommate who was in high school (?). Then I visited demiurge and it turns out he works for them!!! I visited during a workday and they were doing one of those corporate bonding activities and I joined in and did some sort of ropes course or something and I stayed for the whole work day,338,69,12:37:29
Erica Yee,Not my romance lol,18,4,12:37:15
Erica Yee,But the main dream was actually some YA romance thing that was completely different,83,14,12:37:12
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð sorry it was stressful but thanks for sharing,55,10,12:36:06
Erica Yee,And I almost cried,18,4,12:35:54
Erica Yee,I just had a VERY stressful dream about treating my grandparents and dad to hotpot and then the bill was came while I was at home for some reason and it was huge and for some reason the math wasn't working,205,41,12:35:42
Ben Fickes,I just saw you forwarded it and it seems like itâs something he would send you,80,16,12:35:11
Ben Fickes,No,2,1,12:34:55
Erica Yee,Did you see it on fb..,22,6,12:34:51
Ben Fickes,I thought so haha,17,4,12:34:44
Erica Yee,Calvin just sent this haha,26,5,12:34:35
Ben Fickes,What are you trying to tell me,30,7,12:34:25
Ben Fickes,Oh definitely not a problem as Iâm sure you know haha,55,11,12:34:07
Erica Yee,I think my mom feels guilty about your family hosting me so much or something,77,15,12:32:25
Ben Fickes,I was guessing that haha,24,5,12:31:48
Erica Yee,Very honestly I don't want to go home for just a few days lol,61,14,12:31:24
Ben Fickes,And your family and maybe Josh will be at graduation so yeah no big deal either way,83,17,10:10:14
Ben Fickes,But mostly want to see you haha so Iâm good with either place,63,13,10:09:16
Ben Fickes,"For me it would be nice to see your family and josh, even though I think Josh will be pretty busy",97,21,10:08:59
Ben Fickes,My moms taking the next week off of bible study so she says sheâd have to take off that week too but she can if need be,121,27,10:08:30
Ben Fickes,What are your thoughts on that for spring break,47,9,9:58:45
Ben Fickes,Yeah definitely felt restful,28,4,9:57:54
Erica Yee,My mom wants me to ask if you and your mom want to come to our house for spring break and then visit josh or something,118,26,3:11:23
Erica Yee,Was it restful,14,3,23:40:32
Erica Yee,Dang yeah,9,2,23:40:24
Ben Fickes,Time flies haha,15,3,23:35:47
Ben Fickes,I just realized I have only one more day at home,48,11,23:35:44
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. And okeydokey no rush!,33,6,23:35:34
Erica Yee,"Btw thanks for the music email the other day, I will get to it soon!",68,15,22:42:06
Erica Yee,Leah bought a decorative bandit tire and the fortnite llama to put in her room,78,15,22:41:08
Erica Yee,Had to buy something as a story mission (got eridium to do so) so bought a claptrap trinket for my guns,103,21,22:40:42
Erica Yee,Haven't had enough for special guns yet,39,7,22:40:14
Ben Fickes,So have you spent eridium for cosmetic or special guns so far,61,12,22:39:52
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah I remember,18,4,22:39:32
Erica Yee,Remember you have to pay purple stuff for those upgrades in:b2,62,11,22:16:45
Erica Yee,Like backpack and magazine capacities,37,5,22:16:26
Erica Yee,Storage deck upgrade,20,3,22:15:58
Erica Yee,Oh that wasn't even a plot point in b3 that I noticed,53,12,22:15:42
Ben Fickes,What are SDUs,13,3,21:25:29
Ben Fickes,Wow spoiler that sanctuary isnât destroyed in b2,50,8,21:25:23
Erica Yee,"You can use eridium for cosmetics for you/your room or for very special guns now, but buy SDUs with regular money which I like",126,24,21:12:35
Erica Yee,Also sanctuary as a ship is really cool,39,8,21:11:36
Erica Yee,I think it's a perk actually,28,6,21:11:25
Ben Fickes,I heard thereâs one that runs around and shoots,49,9,21:09:07
Erica Yee,"Many of alternate firing modes, like a sniper with a ""bipod"" mode where it emits little flames (idk exactly what it's supposed to be) like two legs to stabilize",160,29,20:57:38
Erica Yee,The guns are sooo cool,22,5,20:56:19
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs honestly how I like to play, using summons to actually fight",69,12,20:50:41
Ben Fickes,No worries thanks for sharing haha,34,6,20:50:24
Erica Yee,Sorry that was a lot,20,5,20:36:45
Erica Yee,Our dog and drone doing all the work,36,8,20:36:33
Erica Yee,"Leah did beastmaster with skag pet and the relationship is so cute. ""WHO'S A GOOD BOY"" in a booming deep voice haha",115,22,20:36:18
Erica Yee,"Not that it matters, not playing for like a year at least lol",61,13,20:35:24
Erica Yee,Therefore I think I'm commiting to clone tree even though I spent a decent amount in barrier already,100,18,20:35:11
Erica Yee,"Spent enough skill points to get health Regen on the barrier tree, but don't think I should commit solely to that tree because the top skill is boosting your barrier..which I don't use",184,33,20:34:24
Erica Yee,"Yup so I got all 3 action skills (drone, clone, barrier) to try them out. You can have two equipped by swapping one for your grenade mod so I have first 2 equipped. Barrier seems kind of useless if I want to move around fights, even with sniping",245,48,20:33:25
Ben Fickes,Are you second guessing doing support?,38,6,20:28:30
Erica Yee,I'm agonizing over which skilltree to do though ahhh,52,9,20:20:13
Erica Yee,Omg I hope she doesn't bring up my favorite things lmao,55,11,20:19:51
Erica Yee,(don't think it was 20 minutes but lol touche),46,9,20:19:42
Erica Yee,"Leah: so you're gonna play MTG right
Me: no dude it's too much thinking and strategy
Leah: says the person who literally stared at your inventory in b3 for 20 minutes to decide your loadout",189,35,20:19:24
Ben Fickes,Aw man. Maybe she wants you to talk about the favorite things song,66,13,20:18:04
Erica Yee,"Ughh my mom set up dinner with my piano teacher tomorrow ""to catch up"" even though I told her I didn't want to. Feel like it's gonna be awkward but oh well will be fine",168,35,20:13:54
Ben Fickes,Ohhhhh gotcha thanks,20,3,20:13:27
Erica Yee,"Oh I told it already, about the murder question",47,9,20:13:06
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! And what was your theology story,41,8,20:11:17
Erica Yee,The only game we played lol got to level 11,43,10,20:04:34
Erica Yee,B3 is so great. Feels like everything I like about the previous but with cool updates and customisations,104,18,20:04:16
Erica Yee,Currently cleaning my room,26,4,20:00:01
Erica Yee,And omg lol,11,3,19:59:30
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad! I'm sure you did great,36,8,19:59:28

Ben Fickes,Thanks! Took so long but it was really really good,50,10,19:46:55
Erica Yee,"Forgot you're doing yours today, have fun",41,7,12:56:57
Erica Yee,Oh that's awesome haha,22,4,12:56:48
Ben Fickes,I found out from my aunt my dad dmed a dnd campaign when he was younger! Will tell you about it later,101,22,12:53:52
Erica Yee,Think we stayed up till 3ish lol,32,7,12:21:56
Erica Yee,Lol omg good job,16,4,12:16:52
Ben Fickes,I beat children of morta,24,5,11:29:42
Ben Fickes,Jk haha,7,2,10:18:54
Ben Fickes,Wow did you just call my âhoneyâ,36,7,10:18:47
Erica Yee,Hny,3,1,3:00:45

Ben Fickes,I just want to observe that even though youâre older than I am Iâm currently in the decade ahead of you,107,21,1:45:17
Erica Yee,Talking to her yag,18,4,1:14:26

Erica Yee,Thanks I will reserve mine till you're asleep,45,8,0:11:04
Erica Yee,And good job!,13,3,0:10:56
Erica Yee,It's ok there's a hacky way to trick it by copying files lol,60,13,0:10:48
Ben Fickes,Youâre behind us but happy new year,37,7,0:00:52
Ben Fickes,We played ultimate werewolf and it was stressful but I one twice as werewolf,76,14,23:58:12
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry,16,3,23:57:33
Erica Yee,Epic doesn't allow you to change your library folder ððð,65,10,21:58:33
Erica Yee,"One of my friends replied to my snap ""my magic deck is worth more than my phone"" LOL ð­",89,19,21:36:08
Erica Yee,Too much strategy for me lol,28,6,21:16:07
Ben Fickes,How do you like it,18,5,20:33:32
Ben Fickes,Wish I was there playing haha,29,6,20:33:27
Erica Yee,"Lol Katie responded to my magic snap ""omg my cousin loves that game, are you playing with Ben?""",95,18,20:23:41
Ben Fickes,Haha wow the video games must be getting to you,47,10,19:52:08
Erica Yee,Turns out it was just because she had seen a pro-life/pro-guns Facebook post...so that was anticlimactic lol,108,17,19:41:02
Erica Yee,"So out of the blue a friend from Leah and Elisa's church messaged Leah asking if she thought God thought murder is wrong in all circumstances (what if it's to save someone else). She had never asked Leah something like that before, and I was like omg what if she's in a serious fight situation (idk where my mind goes sometimes) and needs advice on whom to attack.",364,68,19:40:24
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,19:09:42
Ben Fickes,Friends made last minute plans so after dinner with family going to hang out with them,86,16,18:54:08
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure she was interested in what you had to say if she asked. And Iâm looking forward to it,98,20,18:53:45
Erica Yee,Also theology stuff (I'll type out slightly funny story later (actually only funny in my head)),95,16,18:37:33
Erica Yee,Elisa asked about the most formative books I've read and I think I talked too much lol but oh well,98,20,18:37:00
Erica Yee,Amazing views and we had some deep talks,40,8,18:36:33
Erica Yee,Hiking was super good,21,4,18:36:25
Ben Fickes,Also the spy thing felt really random,37,7,17:03:50
Ben Fickes,Yeah I thought about that too haha,34,7,17:03:33
Erica Yee,"Also thought it was funny how Stormtroopers can't aim, but when they defect and became rebels they suddenly can",111,19,16:47:46
Erica Yee,It's so funny though ð­,25,5,15:44:15
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,15:41:38
Erica Yee,Of the kiss one?,16,4,15:35:08
Ben Fickes,My mom laughed but then said âwait what does the bottom half sayâ so I guess she was just humoring me because the top half alone is not funny,145,29,15:33:25
Erica Yee,Sure lol,8,2,15:32:00
Ben Fickes,Should I show my mom,20,5,15:31:43
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð it works thank you,28,6,15:31:38
Erica Yee,Unless that link works for you,30,6,15:31:30
Erica Yee,Oops lemme send screenshot,26,4,15:31:20
Erica Yee,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/329113477589368843/661064056924536854/Screenshot_20191229-203222.png,107,1,15:31:10
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I love it,19,5,15:30:35
Ben Fickes,Haha I didnât think about that but thatâs fair,50,9,15:30:15
Ben Fickes,But I feel like their bond felt very not romantic but also still real,69,14,15:30:01
Erica Yee,I thought most of the lightsaber fighting was lame. Like you could just do the same exact sequences with swords. I need more cool force stuff beside jumping backwards,166,29,15:29:58
Ben Fickes,Like itâs clearly not part of the plot and is thrown in to make it more emotional or something,96,19,15:29:45
Ben Fickes,*dies,5,1,15:29:23
Ben Fickes,Especially cuz he does,22,4,15:29:19
Ben Fickes,Like that felt very unnecessary,31,5,15:28:52
Ben Fickes,Yeah I also did not like that,29,7,15:28:43
Ben Fickes,And yeah a lot of âall over the placeâ stuff,48,10,15:28:37
Erica Yee,The kiss,8,2,15:28:36
Ben Fickes,Like that just felt dumb to me,30,7,15:28:23
Ben Fickes,Oh the one thing I did not like was that Palpatine was back,59,13,15:28:17
Ben Fickes,What part made you scream,25,5,15:27:58
Ben Fickes,Just finished Star Wars. Really liked it! Will tell you more thoughts in person haha,84,15,15:27:53
Erica Yee,Ok! ð,8,2,12:12:48
Ben Fickes,Weâll see what happens,24,4,11:20:38
Ben Fickes,So I just emailed saying Iâd like to be considered for full time,66,13,11:20:31
Erica Yee,https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.tcgplayer.com%2Ftcg_img%2Fmedia_tcg%2Farticles%2F151023-1-bigpicture.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.tcgplayer.com%2Fdb%2Farticle.asp%3FID%3D12910&docid=4SAGqhcp1sknaM&tbnid=aXkRAtAR3gV3bM%3A&vet=1&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim,272,1,22:29:29
Ben Fickes,Okay haha,9,2,21:32:21
Erica Yee,It's ok it's still early here honestly lol,42,8,21:32:06
Ben Fickes,Sorry Iâll try to be brief too,32,7,21:31:25
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure,13,3,21:31:15
Erica Yee,I'll stop if I'm too distracted,31,6,21:31:13
Erica Yee,If it's ok I'm gonna work on website stuff a bit during but it's mostly mindless,80,16,21:31:08
Ben Fickes,Okay if youâre sure then whenever youâre ready,50,8,21:31:06
Erica Yee,Uh I can talk for a bit,23,7,21:30:37
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm like tonight would probably work better for me because Iâm seeing Star Wars tomorrow at 1 my time but I really donât want to take away from your evening if you have other stuff going on, itâs not that urgent",218,41,21:28:41
Erica Yee,Yeah I could talk tonight if you really want to or tomorrow morning my time,75,15,21:26:02
Erica Yee,Ohh wow,7,2,21:25:26
Ben Fickes,If (and no pressure if not) you happen to be free tonight or tomorrow could I talk it out with you? Just to think out loud. But no worries at all if not I can talk to my mom now and you in Boston,195,44,21:16:57
Ben Fickes,"He also told me about an engineering rotation program - google contracts you for a year, you rotate to different projects, and at the end they hire you if you do well. He said heâd recommend me for either that or full time. But his recommendation doesnât guarantee Iâll get an interview. So I kinda have to let him know soon which I want and I donât know haha",367,69,21:15:18
Ben Fickes,"Okay sooooo the interview stuff: the guy said I did well enough in the mock interview that heâll recommend me for a real interview! He was also so so kind. At the end he said âremember that God has a plan for you, whether or not youâre at google.â",255,49,21:14:00
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,21:12:15
Erica Yee,"wait i lied, the writer sister does write little women in the original little women lol",87,16,19:27:11
Erica Yee,And that's great!,17,3,18:20:47
Erica Yee,Have fun,8,2,18:20:43
Ben Fickes,Sorry gotta go meet with friends but interview went really well and will tell you later,87,16,18:16:39
Erica Yee,How was the interview,21,4,18:15:42
Erica Yee,And one of my best friends from elementary school whom I haven't seen in years happened to stop and say hi! She's working in Maryland lol,137,26,18:14:57
Erica Yee,"Went to Fenton's (the ice creamery that was in up, forgot if we brought you here or not) with Tiffany and Olivia",112,22,18:14:19
Erica Yee,I'm currently chilling in the library cuz I forgot my house key and my dad isn't answering calls haha,101,19,18:13:44
Erica Yee,And I'll tell you about it later,32,7,17:45:54
Erica Yee,Ah praying!,11,2,17:45:41
Ben Fickes,"I have my mock interview in 10 minutes, please pray for me",58,12,16:50:18
Ben Fickes,Seriously thanks for sharing. Ooh where are you going,53,9,16:20:58
Erica Yee,Also we're driving rn,21,4,16:14:45
Erica Yee,"Honestly maybe should be talking to my friends but it's fine haha, I wanted to say all the book and movie stuff earlier before I forgot",135,26,16:14:39
Erica Yee,That's the one I was thinking haha,34,7,16:14:06
Ben Fickes,And nice haha,13,3,16:14:05
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening to all that,32,6,16:14:02
Ben Fickes,Besides roommates for an hour,29,5,16:13:54
Ben Fickes,Wait what group chats have I named,34,7,16:13:46
Erica Yee,My cousin showed us all the dinosaur Yee gif at Christmas but the other cousins and I were like yeah dude we've been teased with that for years lol,147,29,16:13:19
Erica Yee,"Idk who made up we4yeez, my dad probably",40,8,16:12:14
Erica Yee,I feel like you have better group chat names,44,9,16:11:52
Erica Yee,And omgg yeah it's my uncle,27,6,16:11:40
Erica Yee,Lmao the books thing I love it,30,7,16:10:28
Erica Yee,Ayy there are things to do in Delaware haha,43,9,16:10:11
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but when he first came over my mom asked about the âfriends with BENefitsâ group chat. I told her you have good group chat names and told her about Fab Four. Then my mom asked what your family group chat was called and I told her. Then I randomly told her about your uncleâs (if I remember the family member correctly) social media name of âhearyeehearyeeâ. My mom laughed so hard. Then for the next few minutes sheâd just occasionally say âhearyeehearyeeâ and then chuckle again,510,88,16:09:02
Ben Fickes,"Arcade was super fun (if weâre here for spring break we can go if you want) and then we just walked and talked. Got to talk to him a bit about life which was really good too. He was very nice and supportive ( I talked to him vaguely about job search and he said âIâm behind you all the way dude!â) and he also gave very cheesy motivational advice (âwe all have our own chapters in life, and even though we share chapters we all have our own books!â). And he shared a little bit of personal stuff too which was good to talk about",540,106,16:06:32
Erica Yee,Yayy,4,1,16:05:11
Ben Fickes,Hanging with Fabricio was really good,37,6,16:03:54
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Glad you got to meet up,32,8,16:03:47
Erica Yee,(and we did remember to he correct name lol),44,9,15:53:57
Erica Yee,"Lunch with Ethan was alright, there were some awkward paused in conversation but Tiffany kept it rolling lol. Afterward we discussed how we both weren't sure if we remembered his gf's name correctly plus didn't want to ask if they were still together HAHA. Good thing Ethan mentioned her at the end and Tiffany pounced like ""oh how is she""",339,60,15:53:50
Erica Yee,Omg lol nice,12,3,15:47:35
Ben Fickes,I got an S tank on one song,27,8,15:19:37
Ben Fickes,Fabricio and I did that dancing arcade game they had at the senior arcade night and it was super fun,100,20,15:19:31
Ben Fickes,Wow thanks for sharing all that haha. Donât know if I really have a reply but thanks,86,17,15:18:59
Erica Yee,"Secondly, I realise that coincidentally the last two YA books I read were about amusement parks and have a bi main character",124,22,14:34:47
Erica Yee,"Oh two more thoughts: at the end of little women it adds a non-canon meta plot of the writer sister actually writing the book little women, and there's this whole book printing and binding scene which I liked because I did some of it in book class",247,47,14:34:11
Erica Yee,Hope you have fun with Fabricio! Tell him I said hi please,58,12,13:54:58
Erica Yee,I finished hot dog girl last night and it was eh. But read ms. Marvel this morning and it was super good. Apparently not most recent issue though whoops,152,29,13:54:47
Erica Yee,"Oh speaking of flashbacks, little woman kept alternating between different times and it was done really well",108,17,13:53:32
Erica Yee,"Kinda a long story but basically his life of chasing gain and glory catch up with him as people he sorta considers friends get killed or defect to the assassins. Weaves in the true story of two female pirates who dressed as guys and were arrested but got their executions delayed cuz they said they were pregnant. In the game, Edward helps rescue them (he worked with them in the part) but one dies during the escape. Then it also keeps flashing back to his wife whom he left in Wales because he felt like he couldn't provide for her (why he became a pirate)",558,105,13:52:43
Ben Fickes,Wow what happens?,17,3,12:25:36
Erica Yee,Like I actually paused my podcast and turned game volume on to follow the story/dialogue,88,15,12:14:39
Erica Yee,In the main 18th century story part though Edward goes through some serious character development..think I'm a fan although it's very sad,137,22,12:12:10
Erica Yee,Yeah I vaguely remember that from discrete,42,7,12:11:17
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure itâs your favorite part of the game now,52,10,9:28:13
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð well prime numbers are significant in cryptography from what little I know about it,93,16,9:28:01
Erica Yee,Just did an ac hacking quest as part of main mission which was selecting prime numbers that add up to a target number lol,121,24,0:07:48
Ben Fickes,Interesting. Glad you liked it,30,5,0:04:29
Erica Yee,They're poor cuz their parents are too compassionate to others,62,10,23:27:41
Erica Yee,Can women make their own living basically,41,7,23:27:22
Ben Fickes,Oh interesting. Is there any sort of climax/central conflict,60,9,22:42:17
Erica Yee,"Also there's barely any plot, just kinda like domestic struggles and joys",73,12,21:41:43
Erica Yee,Emma Watson slips a little sometimes haha,41,7,21:38:25
Erica Yee,"Kinda weird cuz I'm more used to watching historical British stuff but this is in Massachusetts right after the civil war, and everyone speaks in modern American (like California/Hollywood not Boston accented) English",217,33,21:38:12
Erica Yee,I totally forgot most of the plot so was surprised lol,54,11,21:36:28
Erica Yee,Super well done,15,3,21:36:16
Erica Yee,It was so emotional,19,4,21:35:50
Ben Fickes,Really? What made you feel like that,36,7,21:31:49
Erica Yee,I'm not joking,14,3,21:23:00
Erica Yee,Omg I cried the entire movie,28,6,21:22:53
Ben Fickes,That was a very bad joke,24,6,18:51:17
Ben Fickes,Jk haha,7,2,18:51:11
Ben Fickes,I think grammatically it should be âlittle woman is fullâ,61,10,18:51:07
Erica Yee,Actually little women is also almost full too,45,8,18:42:57
Erica Yee,Jumanji is also sold out haha,29,6,18:42:44
Erica Yee,Just surprised cuz of how long it's been out,44,9,18:42:36
Ben Fickes,And yeah it was almost sold out when we went too,48,11,18:42:11
Ben Fickes,Let me know what happens,24,5,18:42:01
Erica Yee,Wow the next showing of knives out at this theater is sold out,62,13,18:40:35
Erica Yee,I'm like 55% in so guess I'll finish it,39,9,18:38:07
Erica Yee,And yeah it's a character driven book so think she has to haha,62,13,18:37:50
Erica Yee,Maybe but the author is dropping so many obvious hints that the best friend has unrequited love which is different from pumpkins,128,22,18:37:08
Ben Fickes,Do you think her personality will change (like itâs written for her to grow) or not? If you can answer that haha,114,22,18:34:10
Ben Fickes,Maybe itâs like what you were upset with in pumpkinheads where itâs an established friend relationship thatâs âruinedâ by romance? Idk just me guessing,161,24,18:33:42
Erica Yee,And I don't ship. But idk if it's just because of the characters or because the bisexual stuff makes me uncomfortable or what,125,23,18:32:28
Erica Yee,Also I think it's turning into a romance with her best friend who's lesbian,75,14,18:31:43
Erica Yee,"She's simultaneously selfish and like ""no one will love me I'm so lame""",71,13,18:31:13
Ben Fickes,How so,6,2,18:30:23
Ben Fickes,How do,6,2,18:30:20
Erica Yee,She's kinda annoying,20,3,18:30:15
Erica Yee,I'm not liking the main character in hot dog girl..,51,10,18:30:05
Ben Fickes,Np,2,1,18:29:28
Erica Yee,Glad it's better and thanks for sharing,39,7,18:24:22
Erica Yee,Aww :(,6,2,18:24:06
Ben Fickes,Anyways things seem a bit better now but wanted to share,56,11,18:18:22
Ben Fickes,Which we have actually never ever done before (the storming off to room part),77,14,18:18:10
Ben Fickes,He was writing a cover letter for internship apps and ended up snapping at my mom and storming off to his room,110,22,18:17:42
Ben Fickes,Didnât want to say this out loud because not sure how well sound carries in our house but josh was really upset today,119,23,18:16:59
Erica Yee,Jk I was in the bathroom,24,6,17:00:12

Erica Yee,"Ok we could talk Thursday if you want too, don't wanna take away from time with josh",84,17,16:46:57
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâll be done when I can be,33,8,16:45:05

Ben Fickes,Uhhh gaming with josh but can be free soon if I need to be,58,14,16:41:26
Erica Yee,Are you free now?,17,4,16:40:48
Erica Yee,From Joseph's perspective,25,3,16:17:50
Erica Yee,It's kinda obscure but lyrics are pretty,40,7,16:15:26
Ben Fickes,Donât think Iâve ever heard that one before. And okeydokey!,63,10,16:03:36
Erica Yee,We're out for lunch rn but will be back home later,50,11,15:34:14

Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,15:33:40
Ben Fickes,Thatâs awesome! Iâm glad it went well. What was the tough carol,67,12,15:22:56
Erica Yee,The percussionist guys were great,33,5,14:47:29
Erica Yee,I think I drilled this hard carol literally 50 times over the past few days..(because I was playing sheet music arrangement instead of chords) turned out alright,161,27,14:47:22
Erica Yee,but it eventually filled up,27,5,14:46:19
Erica Yee,It was good. My grandparents (driven by my mom) were the only ones in the congregation at 10 LOL,96,19,14:46:13
Erica Yee,Yay thanks for listening,24,4,14:45:41

Erica Yee,"It was a mashup of different passages, a lot of Romans I think haha",67,14,12:18:08
Ben Fickes,And okay sounds good!,21,4,11:34:45
Ben Fickes,"Haha nice ð what was it about, if you remember",49,10,11:34:35
Erica Yee,This is definitely how the scripture was inspired LOL,53,9,11:24:55
Erica Yee,"Omg I dreamt I was at vinewood (my sister's church) but it was at a different location and I didn't recognize anyone there. We were exegeting a passage but it was definitely not a real Bible passage, think my mind just made one up..",232,44,11:24:42
Erica Yee,I'll let you know later today?,30,6,11:23:35
Erica Yee,I could do today or Thursday I think,36,8,11:23:23
Ben Fickes,"If so I think Iâm free today, Tuesday, or Thursday",52,10,9:10:30
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna try to talk one more time before school? No pressure,65,13,9:10:14

Erica Yee,"Ever since I brought up into the unknown, my dad keeps singing ""he is booooorn"" to the melody lol",97,19,22:06:11
Erica Yee,Indeed,6,1,22:05:37
Ben Fickes,Maybe you just have faith that God will carry you through,57,11,22:04:58
Erica Yee,Like 10 min rehearsal lol,25,5,22:02:57
Erica Yee,Because I was playing lover too much earlier HAHA,49,9,22:02:52

Erica Yee,"I was gonna be like ""you could put me in a STS card mod (but please don't)""",75,17,18:15:54
Erica Yee,Oh that's what I was gonna say earlier when you said you didn't know how to make a gift or something,100,21,18:15:19
Ben Fickes,But you could theoretically play a game as the character I made,63,12,18:14:57
Ben Fickes,I had to put in some filler cards because you need at least 9 for it to actually work and I havenât thought of that many haha,127,27,18:14:44

Erica Yee,What are the crowns,19,4,16:45:30
Erica Yee,Whoaa fancy,11,2,16:45:24
Erica Yee,"Not in enough detail to recreate. And the novella ends before he actually makes it lol. It mostly talks about how the puzzles connect with the anime, whose premise is sleeping beauty at a military high school. That world was explained pretty in depth so I actually looked it up to see if it is real. It's not but on the author website she says she wants to make it happen as a manga or something haha",400,77,16:45:04
Ben Fickes,I mean Christmas haha,21,4,16:21:23
Ben Fickes,Photo from thanksgiving,23,3,16:21:17

Erica Yee,Ok I'm done I think haha,24,6,16:01:00
Erica Yee,"And then the book I'm reading now is called ""hot dog girl"" and got it cuz a YA book podcast I listen to really recommended it. It's funny so far, about a high schooler (who's vegetarian) who works in the hot dog costume at a small town amusement fair. Interesting cuz she's bisexual",282,53,16:00:50
Erica Yee,It was just so random cuz the rest of the series is about royal marriages lol,77,16,15:58:25
Erica Yee,(not done yet one sec),22,5,15:50:10
Erica Yee,Just thought it was funny and wanted to share,45,9,15:50:02
Erica Yee,"But was gonna give my book update: I read this really short novella the other day because it's part of a series I read, and part of the premise is that the guy is autistic and really into puzzles, and he gets a job designing an escape room for an anime con themed around a romance anime that he's never seen. And it happens to be the girl character's favorite anime. So yeah LOL it was sorta cute I guess",404,80,15:49:56
Ben Fickes,Oh prob cuz I have it up on my computer but was not watching,60,14,15:49:32
Erica Yee,Ok anyway got interrupted again,31,5,15:48:40

Ben Fickes,Yeah the end of dungeon report takes a while to load which really confuses me because it should be all precomputed stuff? Oh well,129,24,0:31:00
Erica Yee,Oh the main negative thing in reviews is the incredible load times,66,12,0:30:15
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,0:30:00
Ben Fickes,Other bad news is text is incredibly small haha,47,9,0:29:34
Ben Fickes,Bad news is it requires two sets of joy cons per player. So Iâll be fine in Boston but here josh canât play with me,119,25,0:29:21
Ben Fickes,"Good news is I love it, itâs so much fun",42,10,0:28:54

Ben Fickes,Aw dang Iâm sorry to hear that. Hope she feels better again soon,66,13,0:28:36
Erica Yee,ugh my sister suddenly switched to a really grumpy mood and no one knows why,76,15,22:52:51
Erica Yee,which takes time,16,3,22:46:51
Erica Yee,from the reviews it looks like the story is good and you get invested in the players,84,17,22:46:46
Ben Fickes,But maybe Iâll be wrong,25,5,22:45:26
Ben Fickes,"Without having played it, my guess is you will like marvel more",63,12,22:45:18
Erica Yee,but ok xD,9,3,22:44:35

Ben Fickes,Iâm training up characters in marvel on the car ride home. Do you want me to train ms marvel so sheâs better for you to potentially use or train others and âsaveâ her for you to use from scratch,202,39,20:47:23
Ben Fickes,Okay random question,20,3,20:46:45
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha but no pressure,27,5,20:42:28

Erica Yee,Merry Christmas,15,2,12:07:49

Ben Fickes,"ðð thank you for sharing haha, thatâs amazing",53,8,21:43:23
Erica Yee,"And then my dad was like ""([a family friend] has a version called 'butt prints in the sand' in which you don't want to go but Jesus drags you"" ðð",151,30,21:37:42
Erica Yee,Somehow I referenced it in conversation and my sister had never heard it before,79,14,21:36:45
Ben Fickes,Yeah I have haha,16,4,21:30:58
Erica Yee,Omg you've heard of footprints in the sand right?,49,9,21:30:43
Erica Yee,It was actually S SS and I drew the A in,40,11,21:30:32
Ben Fickes,Iâm guessing sass because the other would be kinda rude,57,10,21:24:32
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð sass or the other one,31,7,21:24:21
Erica Yee,I cooked wings and drum sticks tonight so I spelled the word out using them and sent to her haha,96,20,21:23:43
Ben Fickes,HAHA thank you so much for sharing,34,7,20:53:07
Erica Yee,"And then she ate the first S and was like ""look the rest is dad""",64,15,19:57:49
Erica Yee,"Omg Taylor snapped her dad branding her sister's steak at the dinner table to spell out ""SASS"" I'm laughing so hard",115,21,19:57:34
Erica Yee,Ahh my dad wants me to lead a song I don't know (Christ child lullaby) on Sunday cuz it's from Mary's perspective,113,22,19:54:51

Ben Fickes,Matt snapped his sister playing hangman at church,49,8,19:29:24
Ben Fickes,Oh I meant to ask you about that book. From what youâve told me about Leah that sounds like a good pick,105,22,19:14:21
Erica Yee,SO I instead ordered a paperback copy of the YA/bay area/action/fantasy/Chinese folklore book I just finished cuz I think she would like it haha,144,24,18:44:52
Erica Yee,And the only one she really wants rn is b3 but idk if you can gift on epic store and she only wants to play together so it won't work for awhile,144,32,18:43:42
Erica Yee,I was just gonna give Leah a game per usual for Xmas but then since she gave me physical stuff I was like uh is there a specific game you really want or I can think of something else,182,39,18:43:01
Erica Yee,Lol nice,8,2,18:21:15
Ben Fickes,Iâll tell you next time we talk about some of the antics,58,12,18:19:06
Ben Fickes,Service was good. We went to the âfamily serviceâ (which means the one people bring their kids to) and I have never seen so many kids at church. Some were really funny haha,176,33,18:18:57
Ben Fickes,Thanks and congrats haha,24,4,18:18:19
Erica Yee,How was the service,19,4,18:14:06
Erica Yee,"Also I finally did the ac side mission where you have to avoid the sharks and then assassinate someone underwater lol (looking back I definitely could've done it the first time I tried, it's not like I upgraded anything that would've helped haha but yay)",254,45,18:14:02
Erica Yee,"Daniella was talking about how she and Ryan won't see each other for a few weeks because their families are going on vacation consecutively, which especially made me think about us",180,31,18:12:39
Erica Yee,Aww thank you. I've been really missing you too,47,9,18:11:13
Ben Fickes,Also very different topic but my mom kinda rushed me off the phone earlier (and then we were at church 15 minutes early so??) so didnât get to say this properly but I just wanted to say that for some reason Iâve just been thinking a lot about you recently. Iâm incredibly thankful for you and the joy of being able to date you and get to know you this year. And I love you so much and I know itâs been a bit since weâve seen each other but I hope you know that I love you just as much,494,101,17:59:25
Ben Fickes,"Feel really annoyed at the âwe, like Jesus, have been accused of having too much grace for tax collectors and sinnersâ because it seems very convenient that he gets to be like a tax collector but not all the people his policies affect",238,43,17:53:33
Ben Fickes,Dang major yikes indeed,23,4,17:51:49
Erica Yee,major yikes,11,2,16:19:45
Erica Yee,"""Your editorial offensively questioned the spiritual integrity and Christian witness of tens-of-millions of believers who take seriously their civic and moral obligations. """,173,23,16:19:43
Erica Yee,"""We are proud to be numbered among those in history who, like Jesus, have been pretentiously accused of having too much grace for tax collectors and sinners, and we take deeply our personal responsibility to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's --- our public service. """,269,46,16:19:34
Erica Yee,"""We are, in fact, not âfar-rightâ evangelicals as characterized by the author. 

Rather, we are Bible-believing Christians and patriotic Americans who are simply grateful that our President has sought our advice as his administration has advanced policies that protect the unborn, promote religious freedom, reform our criminal justice system""",347,49,16:19:26
Erica Yee,saying he misrepresents evangelicals,36,4,16:19:23
Ben Fickes,What does it say?,17,4,16:17:19
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Dang thatâs really sad. Iâm sorry to hear that,61,11,16:17:14
Erica Yee,ughhh there's a letter signed by evangelicals denouncing CT over the editorial and these bethel musicians i really liked signed it,130,21,16:16:48
Erica Yee,lol apparently i'm hulk color scheme,36,6,16:16:12
Ben Fickes,That pic makes me think of Dora the explorer for some reason idk why,68,14,16:07:38
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing (all of them) haha,37,7,16:07:09
Erica Yee,Other pics,10,2,16:02:03
Erica Yee,My pics,7,2,16:01:56
Erica Yee,The good pic,12,3,16:01:45
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm ready when you are,29,6,14:24:35
Erica Yee,oh yeah perf ok,15,4,14:05:23
Ben Fickes,Wait I gotta shower if thatâs okay I just got back from running,65,13,14:05:04
Erica Yee,one sec,7,2,14:03:51
Erica Yee,oh uh i can talk now then,25,7,14:03:50
Ben Fickes,I have church at 4:30 my time - so Iâm good to talk then but Iâll only be able to talk for a little bit over an hour,120,28,14:01:26
Erica Yee,"maybe like an hour? need to go thru emails, haven't checked in like 2 days lol",78,16,14:00:37
Ben Fickes,Do you know when you would want to/be able to talk?,51,11,13:47:22
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,13:11:18
Ben Fickes,I had a dream last night that your mom left me a voice email (?) telling me how much she liked knives out but also asking me a question she had about something that didnât make sense to her,191,39,10:05:39
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah Iâd love to talk! Yeah we have Christmas Eve service but thatâs it,78,15,9:47:13
Erica Yee,"But after sleeping I'll feel more up to it probably so it's ok if you're not free, I know it's Xmas eve",103,22,2:41:59
Erica Yee,Just got home from party. Free to call tomorrow? Don't feel like typing things out but a lot happened today lol,111,21,2:41:34
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,21:51:10
Erica Yee,Np!,3,1,21:49:25
Erica Yee,But agh sorry,13,3,21:49:24
Erica Yee,Lol sounds violent,18,3,21:49:17
Erica Yee,Ah will try to fight it later but don't wait for me,51,12,21:49:05
Ben Fickes,Sorry just needed to rant,25,5,21:37:06
Ben Fickes,I really donât know how to go forward from here,49,10,21:36:59
Ben Fickes,The trace doesnât even touch my files but itâs clearly something Iâm doing because my âtestâ one card mod still works,127,21,21:36:47
Ben Fickes,Iâm getting a âbusting enumsâ error. I donât even know what that means. And I canât find anything about it online,123,21,21:36:17
Ben Fickes,Ugh this slay the spire mod sucks,33,7,21:35:35
Ben Fickes,No worries,10,2,21:35:28
Erica Yee,"Sorry friends just left and driving to Fremont now, will ttyl",61,11,20:28:22
Ben Fickes,Know youâre busy but wanted to let you know,45,9,19:10:52
Ben Fickes,Oh btw thereâs a guild boss in SEGA heroes,44,9,19:10:43
Ben Fickes,Unless this is a surprisingly dark hsm spinoff haha,51,9,18:00:08
Ben Fickes,Itâll be okay,15,3,17:59:52
Erica Yee,Like I'm scared,15,3,17:58:22
Ben Fickes,Ahhhh as in you canât wait to see what happens?,49,10,15:59:29
Erica Yee,Ahhhhh,6,1,15:54:26
Erica Yee,The teachers are in the robotics lab and leave something on,59,11,15:54:24
Ben Fickes,Like from a chemistry experiment?,33,5,15:25:25
Ben Fickes,Was not expecting that haha,27,5,15:25:18
Erica Yee,Like the school might blow up,29,6,15:25:07
Ben Fickes,Unless you wanna tell me via phone,34,7,15:25:03
Erica Yee,Very emotional and ends on a serious cliffhanger,48,8,15:24:59
Ben Fickes,What happened,13,2,15:24:55
Erica Yee,Omg this ep was so intense,26,6,15:24:44
Ben Fickes,How is hstmts,13,3,15:24:06
Erica Yee,And nice!,9,2,15:23:15
Erica Yee,It was super good,17,4,15:23:02
Ben Fickes,I just met up with a friend from hs. Will tell you about it over the phone but heâs trying to be a volunteer firefighter and is also going to church now (which I donât think he did in high school),200,41,15:17:47
Ben Fickes,And glad you got through the book! How was it,45,10,15:16:55
Ben Fickes,That is funny haha thanks for sharing,37,7,15:16:34
Erica Yee,Just thought it was funny haha,30,6,13:56:11
Erica Yee,"Dad's side = tallest girl cousin (perspective makes me look super tall, it's not that different lol; also other cousin who wasn't there might be around the same height)",168,29,13:55:57
Erica Yee,Mom's side = shortest girl cousin beside Julia (and aizhen who's not there),75,13,13:54:54
Erica Yee,The YA/Chinese folk lore book,29,5,12:41:53
Erica Yee,It was just so good and I was very into resolving plots after watching the movie,80,16,12:41:39
Erica Yee,I'll probably regret this today cuz I was so tired yesterday but I stayed up finishing my book last night when though we got home after 11 LOL,142,28,12:41:15
Ben Fickes,I realized at the end she wasnât talking after answering the phone and I was like âoh noâ,95,18,9:35:31
Erica Yee,I really liked the last twist where Marta lies about Fran (sad) and then pukes,78,15,0:42:11
Erica Yee,"My dad rolled his eyes and said ""deus ex machina"" but they used it throughout!",78,15,0:36:10
Erica Yee,Me too! About puking,20,4,0:35:56
Ben Fickes,Like itâs a weird way to enforce a character only being able to tell the truth but it felt at least somewhat believable,121,23,0:33:25
Ben Fickes,I thought the puking thing was a really interesting mechanic,60,10,0:32:47
Ben Fickes,Yeah I really liked her as a character,38,8,0:31:38
Ben Fickes,But also she saw him die so I was like âhow are they gonna make this anyone elseâs fault? She saw him kill himselfâ,121,24,0:30:59
Erica Yee,"Cuz I knew that meant she would be ""saved"" later",48,10,0:30:32
Ben Fickes,And I kept thinking âokay thereâs gotta be more to thisâ,62,11,0:30:29
Erica Yee,Oh I was so glad,16,5,0:30:19
Ben Fickes,I was surprised when they reveal that âit was herâ so early on,66,13,0:30:13
Ben Fickes,Probably will tell you later,28,5,0:29:56
Erica Yee,Or you can tell me later,24,6,0:29:38
Erica Yee,Did you have any other opinions?,32,6,0:29:32
Ben Fickes,Yeah and then he pulls up and they start barking at him,55,12,0:27:57
Erica Yee,One of the only things I noticed was wondering why the dogs barked to wake Meg up when the dogs didn't bark for marta,117,24,0:27:36
Ben Fickes,Haha yeah josh and I were playing Kirby,39,8,0:26:07
Erica Yee,"""he's awake?""",13,2,0:25:49
Ben Fickes,Will probably ask you more about it over phone,46,9,0:24:58
Ben Fickes,And Iâm glad haha,19,4,0:24:46
Ben Fickes,I know I was really shook by that and I havenât even seen any of the bond movies,82,18,0:24:40
Erica Yee,"""yeah it lived up I really enjoyed it""",38,8,0:24:01
Erica Yee,I'm so shook by Daniel Craig's southern accent,46,8,0:23:27
Ben Fickes,Did it live up to her expectations or did I overhype it,55,12,0:21:58
Ben Fickes,Did your mom like it,20,5,0:21:44
Ben Fickes,Okay haha,9,2,0:21:30
Ben Fickes,To liking it or predicting,26,5,0:21:24
Erica Yee,Thought it was really good,26,5,0:21:18
Erica Yee,Nope not really,15,3,0:21:05
Ben Fickes,And did you predict anything,28,5,0:19:50
Ben Fickes,Did you like it haha,20,5,0:19:44
Erica Yee,My mind hurts,13,3,0:11:14
Erica Yee,Omg I'm so shook,16,4,0:11:08
Ben Fickes,Ooh will do,11,3,21:19:49
Erica Yee,Remind me to tell you about codenames too (same cousin haha),60,11,21:10:30
Ben Fickes,I eagerly await the rest of the story,37,8,21:10:09
Erica Yee,White guy,9,2,21:09:55
Ben Fickes,A new guy or a new white guy,28,8,21:08:46
Erica Yee,"But that one didn't go anywhere don't think, there's a new one",62,12,21:08:35
Erica Yee,Yes white guy,13,3,21:08:14
Ben Fickes,Or is this a different one,26,6,21:06:51
Ben Fickes,Waaaait is this the one with the white guy,42,9,21:06:46
Erica Yee,The one we were worried about going wild,40,8,21:06:12
Erica Yee,That I heard about yesterday,28,5,21:05:55
Erica Yee,Omg speaking of will tell you about my other cousin's first semester on the phone sometime,90,16,21:05:49

Ben Fickes,I picked up on some of the clues but not all and not enough to put everything together,86,18,19:06:56
Ben Fickes,Itâs less straightforward than I thought so I donât know how to explain it all without spoiling it,102,18,19:06:33
Ben Fickes,Oh dang Iâm sorry,19,4,19:05:53

Erica Yee,"Mailed the letter portion of your Christmas gift btw (with a stamp, though my mom made me rewrite the address larger..) hopefully it gets there on time",151,27,14:50:47

Erica Yee,I almost feel asleep during the sermon lol,42,8,13:55:56
Erica Yee,Well it was the opposite last week,34,7,13:55:41
Ben Fickes,Sounds like the opposite of a plot twist,40,8,13:50:47
Erica Yee,Plot twist she came and he didn't,33,7,13:50:19
Ben Fickes,Maybe because sheâs at church haha,36,6,12:46:31

Ben Fickes,Going to bed soon but just remembered I wanted to tell you that I listened to the songs you sent in messenger the other day (the frozen one and Tauren Wells). Really liked âLike you love meâ a lot. And I think you showed me the frozen one before and I forgot haha,267,53,0:28:52
Ben Fickes,Wow if your eyes ever go youâre prepared,42,8,20:44:55

Erica Yee,Who's Matt,10,2,17:49:41
Erica Yee,Oh yikes,8,2,17:49:33
Ben Fickes,Matt was on my team and left so we have only two actual players haha,68,15,16:39:37
Ben Fickes,Wow he just abruptly removed safe zone,38,7,16:20:26
Ben Fickes,And Michael gave us multiple lives...,37,6,16:19:10
Ben Fickes,The only death so far has been my teammate who suicides via teleporting 400 feet into the air,93,18,16:18:59
Ben Fickes,"Because people step out of the safe zone, snipe, then step back in",66,13,16:14:57
Ben Fickes,Will tell you more later but Michael made a safe zone which I think was a huge mistake,86,18,16:14:41
Ben Fickes,This dnd is low key a mess,26,7,16:14:27
Ben Fickes,"Unless my mom sent something too, she mightâve",48,8,16:13:58

Ben Fickes,Does he recognize characters,28,4,13:27:56
Ben Fickes,Oh interesting,14,2,13:27:47
Erica Yee,But still we're very invested in the story (Calvin even more so cuz it's a prequel to the past games),101,20,13:27:36
Ben Fickes,Like throwing rocks at buttons,30,5,13:27:36
Erica Yee,Also the dialogue goes through ever action/military trope possible omg,70,10,13:26:56
Ben Fickes,Ah I see,8,3,13:13:04
Erica Yee,You break it off from a wall,28,7,13:06:14

Erica Yee,Escaping holding cell,21,3,13:04:51
Ben Fickes,What were the puzzle elements,29,5,12:59:08
Erica Yee,Also there's very slight dialogue choices (think outcome it the same but still was surprised) and very very slight puzzle elements (Calvin said he never seen that before in cod),177,30,12:54:48
Erica Yee,"I played 2 more missions of the campaign tho, you get freaking waterboarded and it's not just a cutscene",104,19,12:54:02

Erica Yee,he's super strong and spiritual iirc,36,6,19:55:47
Ben Fickes,Havenât heard of it. Does he have powers haha,47,9,19:54:21
Erica Yee,i tried playing it years ago but could not get into it. think the controls were a bit jank,90,19,19:50:15
Erica Yee,"have you heard of the game ""enslaved: odyssey to the west"" ? it's based on it",77,16,19:50:06

Erica Yee,the guy is the monkey king tho,30,7,19:41:39
Erica Yee,uh never thought about it that way but i think it's interesting,63,12,19:41:34
Erica Yee,lol got it,10,3,19:41:16
Ben Fickes,Are you rooting for her to be taller,36,8,19:39:12
Ben Fickes,No she wants to play (okay is willing to play) but my aunt has said she really wants to play,92,20,19:38:59
Erica Yee,Because it talks about how she's unusually tall for a Chinese girl and the boy is unusually short (but very handsome). Doesn't make a direct comparison yet tho,159,28,17:25:27
Erica Yee,One sec walking,15,3,17:18:16
Erica Yee,Is your mom trying to not play herself lol,42,9,17:18:06
Ben Fickes,Wait how do you know that,25,6,17:17:55
Erica Yee,I think the girl narrator is taller than the guy,48,10,17:17:38
Ben Fickes,"For my one shot, my mom wants to see if my aunt and cousins want to play, which means we may not get to do it until New Years (it they can play, but itâd be cool if they can). Anyways my mom said âcan we just ask them then if they want to play?â And I told her I need some heads up to prep some haha",305,68,17:17:32
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. And thatâs great! As always looking forward to hearing about it,78,13,17:15:04

Erica Yee,How did that even come up,25,6,12:24:08
Erica Yee,LOL what,8,2,12:24:04

Erica Yee,Now I am,8,3,17:57:32
Ben Fickes,Does that mean youâre ready,29,5,17:53:21
Erica Yee,Lemme just eat a slice of cake,30,7,17:44:45
Ben Fickes,"Okay Iâm ready whenever you are, but no rush",46,9,17:41:31
Erica Yee,Oh no worries I'm still omw home haha,37,8,17:19:53

Ben Fickes,It is a tease indeed,20,5,16:09:50
Erica Yee,Cuz you can't get shards yet,28,6,16:09:39
Erica Yee,Is it like a tease,18,5,16:09:33
Ben Fickes,The character portrait has angel wings around it haha,53,9,16:08:59
Ben Fickes,It just looks like a rarer legendary haha,41,8,16:08:45
Ben Fickes,"Silver, a blue character",24,4,16:08:36
Erica Yee,No what is it,13,4,16:08:04
Ben Fickes,Did you see thereâs a âmysticâ legendary character in SEGA heroes,71,11,16:04:31
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,16:03:03
Ben Fickes,"I really appreciate that you shared, seriously",46,7,16:02:05
Erica Yee,I just read too much Wikipedia and this recognize random things,63,11,16:00:36
Erica Yee,Sorry it was rhetorical lol,27,5,16:00:06
Ben Fickes,Idk why haha,12,3,15:59:04
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey,9,1,15:58:56
Erica Yee,"It's an half an hour yep, so sounds good",40,9,15:58:42
Erica Yee,I'm just like why would they put this amount of effort into slightly changing names when they could just use real towns names since it's in a real life setting anyway,166,31,15:58:25
Ben Fickes,Your appointments now right? Iâm gonna try to run before it gets dark if thatâs okay,88,16,15:58:09
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure the author would appreciate that someone figured out the names haha,78,13,15:57:37
Ben Fickes,Thank you for sharing that. Doesnât seem like overthinking or reaching to me,78,13,15:57:23
Erica Yee,That is all lol,15,4,15:56:55
Erica Yee,"""Edison park"" probably riffs off of ""Menlo Park"" (where Facebook is headquartered) because I'm guessing the author knows Thomas Edison worked in a different Menlo Park in New Jersey (the California one is older though I think)",226,37,15:56:47
Erica Yee,"And as someone who knows the bay area, I'm pretty sure the author is just slightly modifying names of actual wealthy bay area towns. ""Anderton"" is almost definitely referring to ""Atherton"" which is the most expensive town in the bay area (median home price is like $6M or something..)",284,49,15:55:17
Ben Fickes,My only comment so far is that âby a Yeeâ instantly made me try to think of a pun with the word âbiologyâ but I canât think of one,140,29,15:54:06
Erica Yee,(sorry had to snap something),29,5,15:53:44
Erica Yee,"Anyway so came across this line ""We were hardly Anderton or Edison Park or any of the other pockets of Bay Area wealth where the venture capital and tech exec families lived.""",175,32,15:52:43
Erica Yee,"So just started this book ""the epic crush of genie lo"" which is a YA in which a paranormal stuff from Chinese mythology starts happening to a normal high schooler in the bay area. Picked it up cuz it's by a Yee haha",215,43,15:52:08
Ben Fickes,Yes please,10,2,15:50:49
Erica Yee,Wanna hear me way overthinking/reaching,39,5,15:50:37
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,15:33:36
Ben Fickes,Yeah I will later I think,25,6,15:10:24
Erica Yee,"not that you have to, but are you working on the mod more today?",64,14,14:56:18
Ben Fickes,Yeah youâre def more productive than Iâve been,50,8,14:50:25
Erica Yee,but i guess that's productive too haha,38,7,14:26:42
Erica Yee,"welp just spent a lot of time doing my advent devo (didnt' even write it lol, copied from a book) for the email chain",117,24,14:26:38
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,13:53:26
Erica Yee,Lol I think I will be able to but will savor your voice anyway,62,14,13:19:47
Ben Fickes,My voice can keep you company when you canât see anything,59,11,13:10:17
Ben Fickes,Sounds good haha,16,3,13:10:06
Erica Yee,Ok can we do it my afternoon after my appointment? You can be my reward for getting work done haha,98,20,13:09:46
Ben Fickes,Not as in we have to rn but as in if thereâs a time for you today that works I can talk then,94,23,12:48:13
Ben Fickes,Finished my blood work so should be able to talk whenever is a good time for you. If youâre still free today,110,22,12:47:48
Erica Yee,HAHA nice,9,2,12:38:03
Ben Fickes,My mom just found out you can reset survival stages in SEGA heroes haha,71,14,11:17:59
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,1:01:30
Ben Fickes,"Okay going to sleep now, goodnight",34,6,1:00:05
Ben Fickes,I know they definitely designed around EST,42,7,0:59:58
Erica Yee,They reset so early for me now haha,35,8,0:59:34
Ben Fickes,"Oh but first, SEGA heroes chests",32,6,0:57:27
Ben Fickes,I should not be awake so I will sleep soon as well haha,55,13,0:57:05
Erica Yee,"That's cool, glad you're enjoying it",36,6,0:57:04
Erica Yee,Think I'm gonna sleep soon lol,30,6,0:56:50
Erica Yee,Dang you're still awake,23,4,0:56:43
Ben Fickes,Seems pretty short,18,3,0:55:10
Ben Fickes,Beautiful art,13,2,0:55:07
Ben Fickes,Short puzzle levels followed by bosses,38,6,0:55:01
Ben Fickes,Okay itâs more interesting than I first thought,49,8,0:54:32
Erica Yee,Oh interesting,14,2,23:43:00
Ben Fickes,As in I think Iâm wrong,25,6,23:41:04
Ben Fickes,Maybe Iâm wrong,17,3,23:40:58
Ben Fickes,Idk yet,7,2,23:40:09
Ben Fickes,After the tutorial,18,3,23:40:07
Ben Fickes,Oh it might just be boss fights,31,7,23:40:07
Erica Yee,Nice,4,1,23:36:21
Ben Fickes,Thatâs it,11,2,23:35:18
Ben Fickes,You move and swing your axe,27,6,23:35:14
Ben Fickes,I love it haha,14,4,23:35:07
Erica Yee,Good thing there's grace,24,4,23:29:14
Erica Yee,Also want to see the worst smiley face ever I just journaled,60,12,23:28:49
Erica Yee,Ooh what's the game play,24,5,23:28:40
Ben Fickes,So very surprised by gameplay at first,38,7,23:25:03
Ben Fickes,I thought it was gonna be a sequel haha,39,9,23:24:53
Erica Yee,And then I look it up and realize why I thought that lol,56,13,23:22:52
Erica Yee,"Literally my first thought was ""is that the bad north one?"" But knew it could not be because the name is obviously different",124,23,23:22:44
Ben Fickes,Viking one with female main character,37,6,23:21:52
Erica Yee,Nvmd I can look it up,21,6,23:21:51
Erica Yee,Which one is that,17,4,23:21:28
Ben Fickes,Iâm trying the jotun game from epic game store,48,9,23:16:40
Ben Fickes,Ah I can see that,17,5,23:16:29
Erica Yee,Yeah pretty well. Both struggling with settling into churches now that they're past the newcomer stage but not super close to people yet,136,23,23:15:43
Ben Fickes,Aw thatâs really good. Are they doing well?,45,8,23:11:07
Erica Yee,Two of my closest friends. We all text and snap a lot but got to talk about deeper things in person,99,21,23:10:47
Erica Yee,It was really good haha,23,5,23:10:08
Ben Fickes,Not that I need to ask but how was it,37,10,23:06:13
Erica Yee,Spent almost whole day with Daniella and Tiffany,48,8,23:03:00
Erica Yee,Omg haha,8,2,23:02:27
Ben Fickes,"And yeah, no rush at all :)",27,7,23:00:01

Erica Yee,"Also saw your email, will read later thanks :)",46,9,22:57:48
Erica Yee,Jk I'm glad it was good,23,6,22:57:39
Erica Yee,Did you make bad jokes back,27,6,22:57:31
Ben Fickes,Also we were in the middle of a group of old people and before the concert started they were shouting to each other across us and making really bad jokes,153,30,22:18:39
Ben Fickes,Not just cuz of voices but also because they seemed to simplify the songs when people were singing along,104,19,22:17:48
Ben Fickes,Concert was really good. Some parts they made the audience stand up and sing along and honestly imo those were worse than when they just sang and did instruments,161,29,22:17:17
Ben Fickes,Okay cool,9,2,19:13:45
Erica Yee,Gonna try to get some work done,31,7,19:12:57
Erica Yee,Think otherwise than my eye appointment at 1pm,46,8,19:12:44
Ben Fickes,When are you free?,18,4,19:10:28
Ben Fickes,And I might get blood work done to check my cholesterol haha,60,12,19:10:20
Ben Fickes,Except when I run,17,4,19:10:01
Ben Fickes,Probably all day,16,3,19:09:57
Erica Yee,When are you free,17,4,19:08:32
Erica Yee,Yeah should be good,19,4,19:01:36
Ben Fickes,Donât have to answer now cuz know youâre busy but would you want to talk at all on the phone tomorrow? No pressure,118,23,18:56:47
Ben Fickes,I look forward to hearing about it :),37,8,18:56:21
Erica Yee,And actually is a pretty edifying depiction of high school friendships,70,11,18:55:49
Erica Yee,Talks about real stuff like parents divorcing and coming out,60,10,18:55:35
Erica Yee,More haha,9,2,18:55:08
Ben Fickes,Do you like it more or less now after watching all of them,58,13,18:51:20
Erica Yee,Yeah just finished the most recent episode haha,47,8,18:45:44
Ben Fickes,Are you still there now?,24,5,17:33:51
Ben Fickes,Nice! Glad you got to talk a lot too,36,9,17:33:46
Erica Yee,Also talked a lot at first,26,6,16:54:17
Erica Yee,But it's fun!,13,3,16:54:02
Erica Yee,Out of the 6 currently out haha,31,7,16:53:58
Erica Yee,We've only finished 2 eps,25,5,16:53:53
Ben Fickes,How was hsm,11,3,16:25:16
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,16:24:14
Ben Fickes,The other idea is a deck where you cards power up proportional to some status effect on the enemy,97,19,16:09:58
Ben Fickes,"One is a deck based around removal, which is based off one of the paper yu gi oh decks I made when I was little haha. Thereâs a popular mod a lot like it though",162,35,16:09:23
Ben Fickes,A couple,8,2,16:08:35
Erica Yee,Do you have any ideas of what you want to do,44,11,16:01:40
Erica Yee,Ooh nice!!,10,2,16:01:35
Ben Fickes,"So I literally only have copied and pasted code from online, but I think I have an example mod now. Out of time to work today if I want to run but if this works I can actually make my own!",188,41,15:47:35
Ben Fickes,No problem :),13,3,14:37:54
Erica Yee,Ok haha thanks ð,19,4,14:37:38
Ben Fickes,But itâs not teeth,20,4,14:36:53
Ben Fickes,And thinking about it while at the dentist,42,8,14:36:45
Ben Fickes,No Iâm telling the truth about the package,44,8,14:36:37
Erica Yee,Wait are you joking about the package,37,7,14:36:18
Ben Fickes,But now that I did not get you my moms suggestion (haha) I have a story to tell you when we talk next,101,23,14:35:31
Ben Fickes,Okay itâs not teeth,21,4,14:35:05
Ben Fickes,The whole tooth,15,3,14:34:44
Erica Yee,Are you telling the tooth,25,5,14:34:30
Ben Fickes,Itâs teeth,12,2,14:32:07
Ben Fickes,I thought of it while at the dentist,36,8,14:32:01
Ben Fickes,"I ordered a Christmas gift for you, it should come Friday",57,11,14:31:51
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,12:10:57
Ben Fickes,I tried to show her but she said she canât see them,53,12,12:07:30
Ben Fickes,My mom says âErica is a funny girlâ (funny as in humorousâ) after I told her about your emoji faces,105,20,12:07:21
Erica Yee,You're welcome haha,19,3,12:01:35
Erica Yee,They're Irish,13,2,12:01:11
Ben Fickes,Also very appreciate the emoji mouths,37,6,12:00:35
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,12:00:29
Ben Fickes,ðµ,4,1,12:00:15
Erica Yee,Whoa that's super cool!!!,25,4,12:00:12
Ben Fickes,Concert is the Gettyâs. My mom says they wrote âIn Christ Aloneâ,70,12,12:00:01
Erica Yee,"""wider!"" ð®",13,2,11:59:46
Erica Yee,Or I guess it's more like ð¦,30,7,11:59:39
Ben Fickes,HAHA,4,1,11:59:38
Erica Yee,ð¬,4,1,11:59:25
Ben Fickes,Was gonna say âprobably just a routine cleaning but will doâ,64,11,11:59:13
Erica Yee,What's the concert,18,3,11:59:04
Erica Yee,And I guess the appointment if you want lol,43,9,11:59:00
Erica Yee,The mod and the concert,23,5,11:58:54
Erica Yee,And ooh lemme know how it goes!,31,7,11:58:48
Erica Yee,LOL whaa,8,2,11:58:35
Ben Fickes,And tonight Iâm going to a concert with my mom and her bible study friends haha,81,16,11:56:53
Ben Fickes,But have a dentist appointment in an hour which I completely forgot about,73,13,11:56:40
Ben Fickes,Iâm good. Really slept in today. Gonna try (again) to make a slay the spire mod,81,16,11:56:12
Ben Fickes,I told my mom the card story and she said âI think Ericaâs dad is going to talk about how you should work as hard as all of themâ or something like that. Thanks mom ð,175,36,11:55:55
Erica Yee,How're you doing,16,3,11:55:39
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,11:55:35
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice, hope itâs good!",26,5,11:54:40
Erica Yee,"I'm on my way to Daniella's house, gonna hang with her and Tiffany today",72,14,11:54:08
Erica Yee,Yep haha,8,2,11:53:44
Ben Fickes,I zoomed in and was like âthat looks like my handwriting but I didnât write you anything recentlyâ,104,18,11:37:59
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I just started laughing out loud,42,8,11:37:37
Erica Yee,"""I saw this already but ok""",27,6,11:37:21
Erica Yee,"My dad just plopped down your thank you card from like August ""what a nice young man""",85,17,11:37:13
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry ð¢,15,3,11:37:09
Erica Yee,Or rather restart it haha,25,5,11:36:53
Erica Yee,I wanna keep playing it next semester if I can,46,10,11:36:48
Erica Yee,Lmaoo,5,1,11:36:35
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today,23,5,11:31:06
Ben Fickes,I just watched a 12 minute speed run of outer worlds,52,11,11:31:00
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,11:24:48
Ben Fickes,And glad small group was good!,30,6,10:48:28
Ben Fickes,Well at least itâs positive feedback haha,43,7,10:48:20
Erica Yee,"Also the professor I asked to review my conference submission finally got back to me lol ""looks promising! If you get to revisions, circle back"" (like if I make it to next round)",178,33,1:02:11
Erica Yee,End of year reflective so people shared some deep stuff. It was also really long (2.5 hours?!),94,17,1:01:02
Erica Yee,"I just went to Calvin's small group, it was really good",55,11,1:00:31
Erica Yee,Nice congrats!,14,2,1:00:07
Ben Fickes,"Liked it a lot, thought it ended well (because sometimes I like a game then hate the ending). Will tell you about it more when we talk",134,27,0:27:38
Ben Fickes,I just finished the outer worlds,32,6,0:26:58
Ben Fickes,Of course,9,2,20:04:05
Ben Fickes,Wow life changes fast,21,4,20:04:01
Erica Yee,Thanks for coming on this journey,33,6,20:03:57
Erica Yee,Oh wait there isn't anymore LOL,31,6,20:03:46
Erica Yee,Nope tried already,18,3,20:03:32
Ben Fickes,Could you convince Calvin to go to tomorrowâs,47,8,20:02:40
Erica Yee,Maybe I'll go to both,21,5,20:02:23
Erica Yee,Oh there is sg tmr lmao,23,6,20:02:19
Erica Yee,Yeah not too bad,16,4,20:02:11
Ben Fickes,Is he doing okay,16,4,19:55:54
Erica Yee,think i'll go tonight since he needs more encouragement,55,9,19:55:09
Erica Yee,yeah oh well will figure it out,31,7,19:53:12
Ben Fickes,And that really stinks for jury duty,36,7,19:44:53
Ben Fickes,You could see if Julia and Tiffany both want to come with to tonightâs? Know itâs a long shot but maybe itâd be a way to have the best of both worlds,155,32,19:44:40
Erica Yee,so i guess i should just go,27,7,19:37:04
Erica Yee,"anyway different problem: was going to attend church small group with tiffany and julia tomorrow since they usually go tuesdays. but calvin now says there might not be a tuesday one and asked if i wanna go with him to today's. but but julia says they haven't notified if there's one tuesday or not. so i'm trying to decide if i should go to today's with him since i want to encourage him to go, although i kinda planned on doing stuff tonight (nothing urgent tho)",463,86,19:37:00
Erica Yee,so rip lol,10,3,19:34:54
Erica Yee,"to answer your snap, jury duties are not the same day but teh federal one is on-call 1/27-2/7 so i tried to request a postponement. even though the online form kept saying ""next section you can request a postponement"" THERE WAS NO NEXT SECTION",243,44,19:34:53
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,17:13:06
Ben Fickes,Because Iâm assuming most people wonât click the i,54,9,17:04:44
Ben Fickes,Not buying any of them haha but Iâd choose the one that tells you all the stuff youâll get in the pic (so the top one),122,26,17:04:30
Erica Yee,which one speaks to you more,28,6,17:00:26
Ben Fickes,Unless this was a mistake and this is just not finished but that seems unlikely,79,15,16:52:43
Ben Fickes,So idk if their data is gonna be accurate,41,9,16:52:27
Ben Fickes,But the character will definitely influence sales too,53,8,16:52:17
Erica Yee,Ohhh interesting,16,2,16:52:13
Ben Fickes,Even though all of those bundles have everything shown in rioâs,65,11,16:52:05
Ben Fickes,"No like whether they advertise everything in the bundle, just the character part of it, or the character and skill part of it",125,23,16:51:51
Erica Yee,Like which character do people want more if they're the same price?,67,12,16:50:06
Ben Fickes,But I feel like thatâs not a good test because ofc itâs different characters,80,14,16:48:47
Ben Fickes,"This seems like a test - the bundles are all for the same thing, but they advertise different stuff",99,19,16:48:31
Ben Fickes,Thank you for letting me live my dream,38,8,16:43:05
Erica Yee,HAHA it is niche but I like it,30,8,16:41:49
Ben Fickes,"Except for now, apparently",26,4,16:41:00
Ben Fickes,"But there is no circumstance to ever use it, nor an audience that would appreciate it (besides Josh)",100,18,16:40:53
Ben Fickes,"âThatâs Xalfer now, folksâ",32,4,16:40:26
Ben Fickes,Iâve had an idea for a long time about a sorta joke with the name Xalfer,74,16,16:40:15
Erica Yee,Xalfer,6,1,16:38:52
Erica Yee,Lol sure,8,2,16:38:16
Ben Fickes,That is all,11,3,16:37:41
Ben Fickes,To compliment peopleâs usernames,34,4,16:37:38
Ben Fickes,What if at the end of every Overwatch match you said good name instead of good game,83,17,16:37:25
Ben Fickes,Wow that just gave me an idea,29,7,16:37:09
Ben Fickes,Haha I thought it was a tiny Tim robot. Good name,49,11,16:37:00
Erica Yee,Tinny Tim iirc,14,3,16:36:44
Erica Yee,Indeed,6,1,16:36:41
Ben Fickes,Is that futurama,16,3,16:36:08
Ben Fickes,(Not really),12,2,16:33:02
Ben Fickes,Iâll title my dnd campaign that,33,6,16:32:57
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing that haha,28,5,16:32:49
Erica Yee,"Random but I think ""friends along the way"" would be a good name for a game that riffs off of the saying",103,22,16:32:22
Ben Fickes,Still at 0 gifts,16,4,16:28:54
Ben Fickes,No Iâm way behind haha,24,5,16:28:48
Ben Fickes,That sounds like exactly what the villain would say before the final boss fight,79,14,16:28:39
Erica Yee,"Wow for a second I legit was like ""omg Christmas is in 2 days? I need to get on it""",83,20,16:28:32
Erica Yee,You've exceeded my expectations,31,4,16:28:05
Ben Fickes,Though I guess you thought itâd take me until Wednesday to find them,70,13,16:27:15
Ben Fickes,Thank you,9,2,16:26:50
Ben Fickes,Well I hate to lower your expectations but Iâm probably gonna be like this before Iâm old,93,17,16:26:47
Erica Yee,Merry Christmas,15,2,16:26:35
Erica Yee,Plot twist I swiped them so I could give them to you for Christmas,66,14,16:26:27
Erica Yee,Wow are we already an old married couple,40,8,16:26:12
Ben Fickes,They were really really buried,30,5,16:25:05
Ben Fickes,"They were in my backpack, like you thought",42,8,16:24:59
Ben Fickes,I found my missing dnd dice,27,6,16:24:48
Erica Yee,ooh nice,8,2,15:29:07

Ben Fickes,All of the outer ones,21,5,15:20:16
Erica Yee,how many worlds have you visited,32,6,15:13:10
Ben Fickes,"I donât know that Iâm at the end, just guessing",51,10,15:09:30
Ben Fickes,I did play it a ton haha,24,7,15:09:21
Erica Yee,But I guess you played it a ton,31,8,15:09:10
Erica Yee,And wow that seems quick,24,5,15:09:06
Ben Fickes,Haha nice. Probably,19,3,15:08:59
Erica Yee,Oh I have so many browser extensions that delete cookies and redirect traffic that I'm sure it messes stuff up,110,20,15:08:45
Ben Fickes,Nice!!!,7,1,15:08:29
Erica Yee,My freelance stories are finally done (save for one more round of approval),75,13,15:08:23
Ben Fickes,Idk if itâs the only way to get it but I think if you stay on the login or 2FA screen too long it goes to that f you try to do something,138,33,15:08:18
Ben Fickes,Iâve gotten that one too,26,5,15:07:39
Erica Yee,Speaking of bugs,16,3,15:07:26
Ben Fickes,Think Iâm getting close ish to the end of outer worlds,56,11,15:07:26
Ben Fickes,That sounds really unsafe haha,30,5,15:07:05
Erica Yee,It's just being buggy rn,24,5,15:06:58
Erica Yee,Which is probably unsafe but I'll take it,41,8,15:06:50

Erica Yee,their production value for 1.5 min video is ðXtoday1!,56,9,15:05:31

Ben Fickes,Oh really? What did he think,28,6,0:09:09
Erica Yee,Also Ariel visited ennyc haha,29,5,23:44:49
Erica Yee,Maybe because I was distracting you during x),45,8,23:42:58
Ben Fickes,But guess kite wasnât too far off,35,7,23:35:31
Ben Fickes,My prediction was the bank share contract was going to be on the back of the paper money the dad drew in the beginning,118,24,23:35:15
Ben Fickes,Okay so Mary poppins is finishing. Was fun but never felt super engaged by the plot. Think Iâd like it more if I could remember the original haha,147,28,23:34:21
Ben Fickes,Congrats haha,13,2,23:33:02
Ben Fickes,We can beef up the guild with your family members,49,10,23:32:56

Erica Yee,"In other achievements I'm not putting on my family post, I cracked 300 in Sega heroes arena rank lol",100,19,23:30:28
Erica Yee,My parents love you,19,4,23:30:08
Erica Yee,Thanks ð¬,11,2,23:29:55
Ben Fickes,Well fwiw I think you have impressed my mom,43,9,23:27:27
Ben Fickes,Okay haha,9,2,23:27:15
Erica Yee,I think it was a joke,21,6,23:26:51
Erica Yee,Idk,3,1,23:26:42
Ben Fickes,Wait so what was your dad referring to,38,8,23:25:30
Ben Fickes,"And itâs okay that Iâm the only one who knows, Iâm glad itâs meaningful to you. And haha thatâs fine I definitely understand haha",139,24,23:25:22
Erica Yee,Oh that was the end of the conversation,39,8,23:24:57
Erica Yee,Honestly one of my main actual highlights is dating you but I am def not putting that in an impersonal fb post LOL sorry,120,24,23:24:46
Ben Fickes,Wait I want to hear about this,30,7,23:24:27
Erica Yee,"Me: what's my proudest accomplishment
My dad: impressing your boyfriend's mother in a way that impressed your mother
Me: what",125,20,23:22:04
Erica Yee,(so you're the only one who knows you're in my answers haha sorry...),69,13,23:21:15
Erica Yee,"The farewell was meaningful but I didn't think it was super amazing, plus a bunch of relatives already put it and I like being original lol. The superhero ones were fun but not as meaningful. Mary Poppins was eh, frozen 2 was good but I wouldn't call it a favorite. Downton Abbey was...you know. Dragon was both a really good, enjoyable movie and a good experience with you haha",378,69,23:20:37
Erica Yee,"I feel obligated to put a movie that I watched in theaters even though that's not a written rule. That narrows my choices down to: frozen 2, Downton Abbey, the farewell, Spiderman far from home, avengers endgame, dragon, captain marvel, Mary Poppins returns (as recorded in my journal, reverse chronological order)",314,51,23:18:18
Ben Fickes,I would love to,15,4,23:13:44
Erica Yee,Do you want to hear my reasoning,32,7,23:13:15
Ben Fickes,Donât know if it refers to your list and youâre genuine or the movie and youâre sarcastic but either way thanks (in the appropriate sarcastic or not voice),161,28,23:12:46
Ben Fickes,Wow I can see your mom doing that,33,8,23:12:06
Erica Yee,Wow I didn't know you made it great job,39,9,23:11:52
Ben Fickes,Also Iâm honored that how to train your dragon was your favorite movie :),75,14,23:11:24
Erica Yee,Also my mom stole my book rec withOUT h/t-ing me so I didn't put that one (the muslim pride and prejudice adaptation that we both read in like a day that I recommended to her),175,35,23:11:18
Ben Fickes,Thank you for sharing haha ð,31,6,23:11:05
Erica Yee,Slightly curated for my family lol but if you're interested ð,64,11,23:09:39
Ben Fickes,Wow I really wish I couldâve been there,41,8,23:08:41
Erica Yee,And ofc,7,2,23:08:25
Erica Yee,I think Victor was singing for some kids worship thing,54,10,23:08:08
Ben Fickes,Lemme know if he seems to bounce back or stay down in the next few days if you wouldnât mind please,101,21,22:54:36
Ben Fickes,And Iâm sorry about Calvin. I know thatâs probably a bummer to him. I guess better now than later,101,19,22:54:15
Ben Fickes,Dang I still canât imagine victor at kids church. Guess we can expect another kimchimberly late night talk,108,18,22:53:48
Erica Yee,"He says he's disappointed, especially cuz it came out of nowhere, but knows not to take it personally and ""is sure [he]'ll get over it in a few days",148,29,22:48:39
Erica Yee,Calvin texted Sandy today asking how her exam yesterday went (I suggested yesterday if he wanted to ask her but we decided to wait a day ((side note: when your friend remembers the schedule of the girl you like better than you..))). She responds with this,255,46,22:47:36
Erica Yee,"So for whenever you have time: Victor is back to pining after kimberlee and trying (and failing) to get her alone to talk. (Guess traveling didn't help) He served in kids ministry today tho and said it was ""chaos"" lol",217,40,22:45:32
Erica Yee,It's weird hearing him do songs he didn't write haha,52,10,22:44:06
Erica Yee,Lol ikr,7,2,22:43:33
Ben Fickes,Wow of course they gave Lin a rap,33,8,22:29:43
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,22:29:35
Erica Yee,Ah yeah of course ð,22,5,22:23:49
Ben Fickes,Also sorry I canât go into more specifics but just wanted to say could you please pray for me and my family,109,22,22:18:38
Ben Fickes,"Okay haha sounds good, I look forward to it",43,9,22:17:20
Erica Yee,One sec,7,2,22:17:09
Erica Yee,Or text later actually,22,4,22:17:07
Erica Yee,I have updates in my boys btw but maybe will tell ok the phone,62,14,22:16:57
Ben Fickes,How was the concert,19,4,22:16:52
Ben Fickes,Will let you know what I think haha,35,8,22:16:47
Erica Yee,"But it was entertaining, hope you enjoy",39,7,22:16:36
Erica Yee,Thought movie was eh,20,4,22:16:22
Erica Yee,Ooh love Emily blunt,20,4,22:16:18
Ben Fickes,Watching the newer marry poppins movie with my mom,50,9,22:15:48
Ben Fickes,"Thank you Erica, I really appreciate it :)",42,8,22:15:28
Erica Yee,Or so,5,2,21:32:34
Erica Yee,Also you should have a package coming on Wednesday,50,9,21:32:32
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening,20,3,21:32:00
Erica Yee,You don't need to apologise for talking so much on the phone haha,65,13,21:31:56
Ben Fickes,Forget the exact specifics,26,4,20:30:09
Ben Fickes,I remember hearing some controversy over one of the events depicted in the game,79,14,20:30:03
Ben Fickes,"No need to apologize for sending so much, I appreciate hearing it all!",70,13,20:29:08
Erica Yee,But game is very good and hopefully I can continue the story. Also now I see how (especially) boys who play such video games are very into military/war stuff,157,29,20:19:07
Erica Yee,And that's where I ended! Sorry that was so much omg,52,11,20:17:19
Erica Yee,"Finally, the part that slightly traumatizes me: so you're helping these rebels names Farah and hadir who are siblings. Farah is so badass and the whole time ""I'm like she cannot die omg"". Anyway a subplot is someone stole all this Russian poison gas and you don't know who. Turns out the brother hadir got a hold of some and uses it in a surprise attack against the Russians ""to give them a taste of their own medicine"". Farah is super appalled, and you find out it's because their city was gassed when they were children so she refuses to ever use that weapon on anyone else. It switches you to a flashback of when they were kids and you play a young Farah. A Russian soldier kills her dad in front of her (mom got killed by collapsing building already) and you end up crawling around your house and stabbing the soldier to take him out..as a little kid....then have to wear his gas mask to go outside....hadir (who's like 10, Farah a few years younger) decides you two have to take a truck as the only way out of the now occupied and destroyed city. This whole time is very nerve-wracking playing but obviously I know they survive because you team up with them as adults. So they're just about to escape with the truck but then get caught by the Russian general you keep hearing about in the present day (so a good vengeance back story setup) and the kids are taken captive",1375,256,20:17:08
Erica Yee,There was this super cool part where you are looking at CCTV cameras in the embassy and trying to guide the ambassador's assistant to stealth out of the office. The gameplay was really intuitive and thrilling,208,36,20:10:12
Erica Yee,"At one point you fly drones to take out enemies (I was the worst at this part..can't get used to inverted joystick controls) and Calvin was like ""didn't you just write a paper on the ethics of drone use""",203,39,20:08:37
Erica Yee,"So I started the campaign story mode from the beginning on easiest mode. Even on that mode I was kinda proud of myself for how well I was doing with the Xbox controller, got some achievements like not hitting any civilians in a crowded London square during a terrorist attack. The art is super realistic and story is actually really engrossing. You play as a few different cia agents (as far as I can tell) helping rebels in a fictional country fight Russian Invaders in modern time. It seems quite similar to stuff you hear going on with the Syrian civil war which is very depressing and dark. Forces you to make some moral choices like whether to kill hostages (though it's a set storyline)",692,125,20:07:10
Erica Yee,Oh I can type out the cod stuff now lol,39,10,20:02:29
Erica Yee,Actually got started on the wireframing earlier which is good,61,10,20:02:19
Erica Yee,Currently at a fun concert with family,38,7,20:02:06
Erica Yee,I'm alright. Feeling slightly better,36,5,20:01:47
Erica Yee,Ofc haha,8,2,20:01:29
Ben Fickes,Oh and thanks for the input!,28,6,19:01:56
Ben Fickes,How are you doing,17,4,19:01:45
Ben Fickes,Okay will review and send,25,5,19:01:42
Erica Yee,"But yah looks good, thanks for asking",37,7,18:46:28
Erica Yee,"Instead of ""so we could stop by"" maybe ""we'd love to see you"" cuz that's kinda the point of the trip",100,21,18:45:41
Erica Yee,I feel the same way as you about asking you stay but it's a perfectly normal thing to ask haha,94,20,18:44:41
Erica Yee,P.S. we beat the entire Harry Potter game!!,43,8,18:43:30
Ben Fickes,Iâll change that,18,3,18:12:38
Ben Fickes,Wow Iâm a complete old person I signed my name on a message,61,13,18:12:35
Ben Fickes,"Hey Albert!

Erica and I are considering visiting New York for a few days at the beginning of our spring break - the first week of March. Do you know if you and Siu Kay would be around so we could stop by? Also, would you be willing to let us stay at your place for a few nights, if youâre around? (If not, no worries! We know other people in the city we can ask, or worst case we can stay in Delaware).

Hope all is well and hopefully weâll see you in a bit!

Thanks,
Ben",476,98,18:12:19
Ben Fickes,Okay hereâs my draft of a message to Albert. I feel really bad asking to stay at their place for some reason but I guess I shouldnât. Lemme know if anything should be reworded. Also lemme know if you think I should wait to ask to stay with them and just ask if theyâre around for now,289,57,18:12:16
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry. And yeah no rush at all,41,9,12:23:18
Erica Yee,Will tell you about cod later when I get a chance lol,53,12,12:22:11
Erica Yee,Ooh wow,7,2,12:21:58
Erica Yee,I think my period is wrecking me but it's fine,46,10,12:21:50
Ben Fickes,Was assisting minister at church and the bishop was here,56,10,12:17:06
Ben Fickes,Oh glad youâre not sick haha. I actually feel fine now too,60,12,12:16:55

Erica Yee,Sorry went to bed super early cuz I thought I was sick,54,12,11:40:25
Ben Fickes,In other news (to tell you later) I have an idea for a one shot now,67,16,22:51:25
Ben Fickes,No worries haha take your time,30,6,22:51:09
Erica Yee,Wait sorry I'll type later,26,5,22:50:45
Erica Yee,Sorry started typing then we headed to dinner,45,8,22:49:55
Ben Fickes,What traumatized you,20,3,22:44:51
Ben Fickes,Oh dang was about to ask how it was,35,9,22:38:52
Ben Fickes,Np :) will probably send it to you before I send it to them haha,64,15,22:38:45
Erica Yee,Omg just played a bunch of cod and I'm slightly traumatized,59,11,22:38:43
Erica Yee,"Sure, thanks!",13,2,22:38:31
Ben Fickes,Iâll send them a message tomorrow?,36,6,22:37:55

Erica Yee,The jacket,10,2,18:49:23
Erica Yee,LOL nice,8,2,18:37:03
Ben Fickes,Wow my English professor loved the github thing. Referred to it as âindustry appropriateâ,93,14,18:05:48
Ben Fickes,I mean you remembered so thatâs good,38,7,17:52:45
Erica Yee,I am so bad at gifts haha,25,7,17:48:51
Erica Yee,Walked out the door without his bday gift and had to go back omg,64,14,17:48:46

Erica Yee,Ok ready?,9,2,15:31:35
Erica Yee,"Gonna be around 1230, leaving gym now and gotta shower",54,10,14:47:45
Ben Fickes,Maybe less competition for me is why I transferred out,54,10,14:11:30
Erica Yee,Less competition for me ð,28,5,13:56:48
Erica Yee,Lol np,6,2,13:56:42
Ben Fickes,"Dropped AI too. Picked up Game AI and Mobile and Wireless systems but considering taking machine learning instead of that, weâll see",134,22,13:53:58
Ben Fickes,"Dropped HCI, sorry",18,3,13:53:17
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,12:48:49
Erica Yee,Ok should work,14,3,12:46:04
Ben Fickes,No pressure if youâre too busy though,39,7,12:39:58
Ben Fickes,Yeah that works fine!,21,4,12:39:49

Ben Fickes,"Thanks for sharing that Erica :) and I am looking forward to hearing about it haha. Would you want to call today or tomorrow? No pressure if not, I know youâre busy",166,32,9:15:49
Erica Yee,Both ^ are short funny stories and not deep at all,50,11,1:42:32
Erica Yee,"To add to list for call:
- my parents and prayer
- interracial relationships",76,14,1:42:23
Erica Yee,Just wanted to share that my mom's small group tonight collected gifts and wrote a card for the friend of this small group member who just got released from prison. Both of them were lifers but found Jesus inside. The friend is the one who brought the small group member to faith inside actually. (This small group member is the one getting married next summer). So it was really cool to pray and celebrate for his friend. Hope you're getting a lot of rest,456,84,1:41:57
Erica Yee,Nice,4,1,20:40:18
Ben Fickes,Yeah it was pretty good,23,5,20:33:01
Erica Yee,Did you like it?,16,4,20:26:20
Ben Fickes,This place makes their own beers so it sounds like that,55,11,20:24:16
Ben Fickes,Called âSantaâs little helperâ,36,4,20:23:58
Ben Fickes,A beer,6,2,20:23:49
Erica Yee,Ooh what did you have,21,5,20:18:14
Ben Fickes,I feel like a lightweight compared to my mom which is a weird feeling haha,74,15,20:16:27
Ben Fickes,My mom and I both had drinks with dinner (but my mom is driving us home!?!?!?) and I felt a little lightheaded after like half of mine so I stopped haha,152,31,20:16:03
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,19:23:45
Ben Fickes,Yeah it got to the judge,24,6,19:11:18
Ben Fickes,Thank you,9,2,19:11:12
Erica Yee,do you know what happened to your letter?,41,8,19:02:50
Erica Yee,ah wow. i'm so sorry about it all :/ will be praying,52,12,19:02:40
Ben Fickes,But itâs so hard on the firefighters and everyone to do nothing or very little seems not right,96,18,18:59:29
Ben Fickes,"Like sheâll be 53, best case scenario, when she gets out of prison. And what about her son all this time?",107,21,18:58:46
Ben Fickes,I just feel sad that the situation sucks so much for everyone,61,12,18:57:43
Ben Fickes,I can tell itâs a bit hard on my mom. Weâre getting dinner because she says she doesnât feel like cooking. She asked me a couple times whether I thought she said the right thing,183,35,18:57:24
Erica Yee,How are you and your mom feeling,32,7,18:52:39
Erica Yee,Dang ok. Thanks for letting me know,35,7,18:52:29
Ben Fickes,"So my phone is gonna die soon but wanted to let you know that my mom went to the sentencing today. She told me about it. Will tell you more over the phone but to give t highlights, the woman got sentenced to 30 years (she can have 5 less max for good behavior). Sheâs served 3 already. Sheâs going to be given some sort of help for drugs alcohol etc. and an opportunity to earn her GED. She has a 15 year old son, my mom doesnât know what happens to him",459,93,18:44:56
Erica Yee,Lol nice,8,2,17:31:21
Ben Fickes,Slept through the whole thing haha,34,6,17:26:05
Erica Yee,Yay how was it,14,4,17:24:58
Ben Fickes,My flight just touched down,27,5,17:19:43
Ben Fickes,Dang. Iâm sorry. At least you have stuff to correct for it,60,12,17:19:35
Erica Yee,Reason why I can't see very well distance outside is my contacts don't correct for astigmatism (but glasses do). Now it's gotten worse enough that I need my contacts to correct for it too,187,34,16:47:02
Erica Yee,Welp have to go back again next week,36,8,16:46:13
Erica Yee,Like my dad was roommates with him at one point and still flinches when he hears his name,89,18,16:18:22
Ben Fickes,Haha how much is too much,25,6,15:43:26
Erica Yee,Family friend doctor who talks waaaaaaay too much..,51,8,15:43:03

Erica Yee,Yah sure,8,2,15:42:23
Ben Fickes,Since he seems like the easiest of them,39,8,15:42:11
Ben Fickes,How about class 1 non eggman now and when weâre ready for eggman again we try class 2,87,18,15:42:03
Ben Fickes,"Okay. Class 2 might be okay, it is only for 24 hours",52,12,15:41:36
Erica Yee,And lol nice,12,3,15:41:24
Erica Yee,"Ah ok no worries, we can do class 1 beside eggman",49,11,15:41:10
Ben Fickes,I really wedged my bag into the overhead. Hope I can get it out haha,68,15,15:39:50
Ben Fickes,Idk how active he is though,27,6,15:39:16
Ben Fickes,"So Iâm personally down, we have been tearing through the class 1s. But Danny probably wonât be able to really fight them",124,22,15:39:08
Erica Yee,Is class 2 still too much,25,6,15:34:23
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,15:34:10
Ben Fickes,"Okay I told you a bit, have more to tell you when we talk. And yeah itâs not a big deal. And yeah sure thing!",111,25,15:32:18
Erica Yee,Can we do a different boss,26,6,15:31:03
Erica Yee,Aww at least you get home a little earlier,42,9,15:30:31
Erica Yee,Just that it's not Northeastern people and you suggested hiding,63,10,15:30:21
Ben Fickes,Did not get later flight and $ haha,35,8,15:26:54
Ben Fickes,Wow you were ahead of me in the boss fight,42,10,15:21:23

Ben Fickes,Might be taking a later flight for $600!!! Weâll see what happens,67,12,15:02:17
Ben Fickes,You could change that,21,4,15:01:54
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. You can make a custom end of day if that helps,55,13,15:01:50
Erica Yee,Which is kinda annoying,23,4,14:32:49
Erica Yee,Habitica doesn't change time zone,33,5,14:32:13
Erica Yee,Have a safe flight,18,4,14:20:38
Ben Fickes,Iâm on the way to the airport now,35,8,14:09:01
Ben Fickes,Dang that sounds super busy. Hope you get some time for yourself too,68,13,14:08:53
Erica Yee,"Hopefully finish conference submission (professor never got back to me) and freelance story (also people not getting back to me), and start the website project",159,25,13:44:35
Erica Yee,"At the gym rn, then have eye appointment to get new contacts prescription (maybe will be able to see far signs soon lol). Playing Christmas carols for my mom's small group party tonight",185,33,13:43:49
Ben Fickes,Any plans for the day?,22,5,13:35:53
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,13:33:54
Ben Fickes,Heâs studying abroad in Australia and then going to try to co op in Europe (because under student visa he can only work for a year in the us and he wants to do three co ops),175,37,13:06:52
Erica Yee,Oh why not?,11,3,13:05:57
Ben Fickes,Oh very random but apparently Thiago wonât be in the US for the next year?,76,15,13:04:55
Ben Fickes,Makes sense then I guess,24,5,13:04:11
Erica Yee,One of my uncles has never been to Boston so guess that was also a factor,73,16,12:56:59
Ben Fickes,I understand haha. It is their choice though,44,8,12:55:51
Erica Yee,Ok I know I should be grateful and I am but I really don't see the point of them all coming,91,21,12:55:25
Erica Yee,WHYY,4,1,12:55:11
Ben Fickes,At least Iâll get to meet your aunt and uncle(s) I guess,58,12,12:55:02

Ben Fickes,I had a dream that my mom was driving me home from church (at home) and I was on the phone with you. You were telling me about how much Calvin loves football and how happy he was it was super bowl Sunday. Then I got home and Melina and Kenny were waiting at my house. Kenny told me he was having trouble with the next soft dev assignment. He started messaging me code even though I was right there? Very stressful and when I was waking up I was like âno! We gotta fix this!â,478,96,8:52:07

Erica Yee,ok so plot so far is the main girl protag (nini) and boy (ricky) used to date but broke up over the summer when he didn't say i love you back (actually gets into interesting family dynamics/background on why). to win her back he tries out for the musical which she is also auditioning for because she loves theater,314,59,13:52:43

Ben Fickes,"Kenny said his parents are religious (catholic) and that he was really religious himself until around 8th grade, when he sorta drifted away. He asked about differences between Catholicism and Lutheranism (he was surprised when I told him Protestants donât pray to saints haha). He asked a lot of questions, some about the problem of evil, and kept saying âIâm not trying to dunk on your faith or anything! Iâm genuinely curious.â",439,72,9:06:46

Erica Yee,"Omg shuttle is wild. Was getting concerned cuz the 320 wasn't showing up. Finally at 330 i see it coming down Boylston. As it's passing hynes, it goes next to a car whose door opens and almost hits the bus. Then when we're trying to get on, the lady who came out of that car comes up to the shuttle driver. She's in casual clothes, no massport identification apparent on her or the car. She yells up at him to skip Copley and go straight to the airport using a alternate route. He's like ok (guess he knows her? Hopefully) but then other passengers coming from the airport were like ""what? We're not stopping at Copley?"" And started getting mad. But they had to get off unless they wanted to go back to the airport lol",718,136,15:38:56

Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,20:59:12
Ben Fickes,"Oh Iâm glad!! Meeting was good and quick. Kenny had the wrong day for our presentation haha. Donât think itâll be too much work.

Ben Fickes,"Iâll let you know when I know when Iâm meeting with soft Dev. And Iâm sorry, Iâll definitely be praying",111,20,16:29:54
Erica Yee,Also if you could pray for me.. feeling headachy.. would be appreciated,71,12,15:45:57

Ben Fickes,Well Santa drives a sleigh so guess heâs gotta do something with his extra tires,82,15,12:29:49
Erica Yee,"My dad sent a pic of an (unwrapped) tire next to the Christmas tree with the caption ""santa came early"" which I think is hilarious because 1) he bought the tire, 2) the tire is for the car he drives the most, and 3) he's the one who blew the tire that needs to get replaced LOL",277,57,12:28:14
Ben Fickes,Geez I have no idea how you could take care of so many kids haha,64,15,12:22:35
Erica Yee,"Helen Eileen Beardsley (nÃ©e Brandmeir, formerly North; April 5, 1930 â April 26, 2000) was the mother of a noted blended family of twenty children â eight by her first marriage to Richard North, ten stepchildren from her second husband Frank Beardsley, and two that she and Frank had during their marriage. She wrote a book, Who Gets the Drumstick?, about her blended family's experiences.",394,65,12:08:20

Ben Fickes,"Yeah I added something that will hopefully make the error less likely, though we still hit it a fair amount of the time",119,23,17:59:32
Erica Yee,Ben-like silver liningÂ©ï¸: maybe it won't fail the time the grader runs it,76,13,17:58:55
Erica Yee,Oh man ok,9,3,17:58:15

Erica Yee,Aw did you submit it!,21,5,17:36:57
Erica Yee,"Just finished, event was actually really good",45,7,17:36:44
Ben Fickes,Jason and I are almost giving up on networks. Iâm gonna try one last thing after I eat and see if it works better than what we have. Then regardless weâre gonna submit it,174,34,15:32:26
Ben Fickes,Aw I hope itâs good. And gotcha. Just curious,47,9,15:31:57

Hello Friendos!

Iâll get to the good God stuff in a sec, but some context and catch up:

Itâs been a time of transition for me.  A lot has changed in the past two months haha.  Iâm employed at an outpatient clinic in East Boston, which means a lot of vaccinations and a lot of Spanish-- Iâm trying to learn, pero no hablo espagnol muy bien. Un poquito.  But because I have a job, I go to bed at like, 11, which is HUGE for me-- bro I used to be able to do a 12 hour shift running on 3.5 hours of sleep.  I was insane.  Now Iâm just always tired, but like a normal tired, not a delirious I might die tired.  


And the big one, Shem and I separated in October.

October  S U C K E D.

But for the past two months Shem and I have been âreally good friends,â his nickname on Facebook is actually âMy Good Friend,â because Iâm that delusional.  People told me that it would be better if we had time apart, but I was already so sad to be less close to him, to sever things entirely would be too painful. But after a bunch of sus looks from a bunch of sisters and some God conviction we stopped talking for a week.  I gave God a week LOL.

But itâs advent.  And Iâve been trying to prepare my heart for Jesus. 

And Godâs teaching me that âpreparing your heartâ is more than just anticipation and waiting, itâs also clearing out.  If thereâs not enough room in your heart and mind for Jesus, his impact canât fully enter.  And Iâve come to realize that God wonât have the literal redemption of the universe be cheapened by half-hearted commitments and compromises.  Iâm preparing my heart for Jesus by clearing space, and God called me to cut contact with Shem (I gave him context and it ended amiably, albeit tearfully).",1943,354,10:34:25
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah Iâd really love to,28,6,10:32:04
Erica Yee,it's quite powerful,19,3,10:22:47
Erica Yee,would you like to see what renee wrote about her and shem in her advent devo,76,16,10:20:12
Erica Yee,Uh yikes,8,2,22:59:45
Ben Fickes,Ty sent me this out of nowhere,30,7,22:56:03
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Yeah after outer worlds I might like fallout. Weâll see,68,12,20:47:27
Erica Yee,"Ah nice, it's on my to play very far in the future lol",54,13,20:46:57
Ben Fickes,The Boston one,14,3,20:45:57
Erica Yee,Which fallout,13,2,20:23:01
Erica Yee,Omg haha,8,2,20:22:58
Ben Fickes,"Me: âwe have expired milk in our fridgeâ (itâs Mattâs)
Matt (playing fallout): âIâll take care of it
Matt: âSiri, set timer for one hourâ
Matt: âIâll take care of it in an hourâ",199,34,20:21:11
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,20:09:52
Erica Yee,And ooh nice!,13,3,20:04:07
Erica Yee,Well I basically told you all the thoughts I have about it already lol,70,14,20:03:57
Ben Fickes,Just hung out with a friend I havenât seen all semester for like 40 minutes haha,82,16,20:02:41
Ben Fickes,Ohhhh gotcha haha. I really do look forward to hearing about it,63,12,20:02:24
Erica Yee,They have very clear personalities (as in are well rounded characters) that are also shaped by their faith,106,18,19:13:39
Erica Yee,Oops meant *so I'm very encouraged,34,6,19:12:07
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Yeah that sounds like what Iâd like too. What about then encourages you?,83,15,19:09:46
Erica Yee,And I'm very encouraged by these fictional Christian characters haha,68,10,19:07:22
Erica Yee,Which I really appreciate. Because I don't usually like the cheesy miraculous salvation stories in Christian books. This one is more like people must trying to live their lives living God and others the best they can,216,37,19:06:52
Erica Yee,Like the characters pray a lot as they go about their lives and are attracted by their love interest's fear of God.,115,22,19:05:14
Erica Yee,Yeah I was just gonna say how it's more Christian-y than I remember the author's other books being,98,18,19:02:47
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,19:02:12
Ben Fickes,I look forward to hearing about the rest of it haha,51,11,18:43:13
Ben Fickes,Oh dang that sounds intense. Didnât you have something on the book you were gonna tell me again?,98,18,18:43:02
Erica Yee,But there's 31 chapters!!! What else is gonna happen?!,54,9,18:41:34
Erica Yee,"Omg so I'm on chapter 19 of my book and there was already an ""omg she's fatally ill is she gonna make it"" situation and then she does and they agree to actually be married to each other of their own volition (they're already legally married for convenience cuz the Puritan leader doesn't like people being in situations where they could fornicate), which in many other books is already enough of a plot arc",406,74,18:41:15
Erica Yee,Hopefully,9,1,18:34:27
Ben Fickes,Yeah but no pressure. Iâll see you in January too haha,56,11,18:29:53
Erica Yee,I realize our time is running short,35,7,18:29:07
Erica Yee,Probably will be down,21,4,18:28:53
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs good! If you wanna hang out at all then let me know, but if you want time to yourself I also understand and thatâs completely fine",144,28,18:18:06
Erica Yee,Also I decided to Sabbath tomorrow night,40,7,18:17:27

Erica Yee,"Was watching a video about why the sermon should not determine worship song selection and the intro example was ""some people have been sending in questions like 'my pastor is preach on balaam's donkey, what songs should I do?'"" said with a straight face LOL",257,45,14:21:26
Erica Yee,Always finding a silver lining haha,35,6,13:06:39

Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,11:15:15
Ben Fickes,And I can see you saying that. And I already make dad jokes now so I can definitely see that for me haha,104,23,11:06:21
Ben Fickes,Yeah I didnât mean to say it doesnât wreck your plans just wanted to try to point out a silver lining,105,21,11:05:59
Erica Yee,"I can imagine myself saying loudly in public ""DOES ANYONE KNOW WHOSE KID THIS IS"" and you just constantly making dad jokes",122,22,10:40:45
Erica Yee,I mean yeah but I need to focus on capstone first so this wrecks my plans a little,82,18,10:40:17
Ben Fickes,"1. Dang Iâm sorry. Are you done sooner then though?
2. Haha thatâs hilarious. Do you think we would though?",111,20,10:35:00

Ben Fickes,"As a wise woman once said, âinterestingggggggâ",50,7,12:02:54
Erica Yee,which i guess is good but maybe not on a dating app?? idk what etiquette is,75,16,11:59:15
Erica Yee,WOW he would be interested in keeping talking to irene but not going on another date,84,16,11:58:59

Ben Fickes,Wow this was John Lam that asked you out,40,9,11:51:49
Erica Yee,i won't LAMbaste you for that,29,6,11:49:39
Ben Fickes,And Iâm being completely Johnest about that,45,7,11:48:31
Ben Fickes,I canât even think of a comeback for that,43,9,11:48:19
Erica Yee,i philly disagree,17,3,11:45:20
Ben Fickes,Think youâre too far John for him,35,7,11:43:49
Erica Yee,John from Philly just asked me out so it's all good now,55,12,11:41:31
Ben Fickes,Also really appreciate that you thumbs downed your own message,62,10,11:40:42
Ben Fickes,Wow I just laughed so hard at that,34,8,11:40:31
Erica Yee,and that's what i've ben saying all along,41,8,11:40:07
Erica Yee,biblicallyee it is tho,22,4,11:40:01
Ben Fickes,âYee arenât the one for meâ,33,6,11:39:22
Ben Fickes,Biblically inaccurate but okay,30,4,11:39:15
Erica Yee,"""going on another date with you would be against the ben commandments""",70,12,11:37:30
Ben Fickes,"""I Ericannot go on another date with you""",41,8,11:36:18
Erica Yee,"""i'll go on another date with you ben pigs fly""",47,10,11:35:43
Ben Fickes,"""Irene-y don't think we should go on another date"" - that's what he can tell her",80,16,11:34:28
Ben Fickes,oh that's too bad,17,4,11:33:56
Erica Yee,don't think so,14,3,11:32:57
Ben Fickes,does he want to go on another date with irene,45,10,11:30:41
Erica Yee,he also wants help on what to say to irene cuz he didn't feel like they connected that well,91,19,11:29:43
Erica Yee,same sigh,9,2,11:29:25
Ben Fickes,Because yeah he seemed slightly forceful and tacked on texting question as an afterthought (as in that's how it reads to me),124,22,11:27:27
Ben Fickes,Okay I like your message a lot better than his,46,10,11:26:55
Ben Fickes,"I was about to say ""if journalism doesn't work out you can start a relationship advice column."" But I guess that is journalism technically still?",145,25,11:26:48
Erica Yee,cuz i'm losing it a little,26,6,11:26:32
Erica Yee,"and then i was like ""not to nitpick by i think you should've said COULD not SHOULD""",83,17,11:26:28
Erica Yee,"he basically ended up with ""if you're still up for it afterwards then we should meet up again. do you still want to text?""",122,24,11:26:18
Ben Fickes,okay that's actually really good I think,40,7,11:25:49
Erica Yee,"""Are you still ok with texting each other even if we don't make plans to meet up again yet""",91,19,11:24:55
Erica Yee,days*  yikes,12,2,11:24:31
Erica Yee,ok talk to you in a few ways,28,8,11:24:26
Ben Fickes,"Not that that's the way to do it by any means, just what I think I'd be doing in his shoes",90,21,11:21:35
Ben Fickes,I think in his shoes I would go silent for a few more days and letting her have the initiative and then text after a few if she said nothing,140,30,11:21:20
Ben Fickes,Because I can't imagine asking about texting without being awkward,66,10,11:20:53
Ben Fickes,say,3,1,11:20:37
Ben Fickes,What did you tell him to day,28,7,11:20:35
Ben Fickes,HAHA nice,9,2,11:20:30
Erica Yee,"Me: *gives idea of what to say*
Him: Yeah but what would I actually say
Me: *gives more specific idea with the caveat ""idk lol""*
Him: Hm I could work with that lol",163,33,11:20:17
Erica Yee,Wowowow so ungrateful,21,3,11:19:23
Erica Yee,Although feel free not to,25,5,11:19:04
Erica Yee,Thanks for affirming me haha,28,5,11:18:59
Ben Fickes,yeah he def is in a worse spot. Glad you could try to help though,65,15,11:17:27
Erica Yee,But we'll see what he actually does,35,7,11:16:12
Erica Yee,"So NOW I'm like ask if she still wants to text even if you don't meet up, cuz you need to figure out if she's still interested at all",133,29,11:15:59
Erica Yee,Which I guess is something,26,5,11:14:56
Erica Yee,"And she said she doesn't have time, finals are coming soon, ""maybe after""",73,13,11:14:46
Ben Fickes,Did she reply,13,3,11:14:06
Ben Fickes,Uh yeah I'm with you,20,5,11:14:02
Erica Yee,"But he actually asked if she wanted to get food again together this week (which i think is too fast without giving her an ""out"")",128,25,11:12:53
Erica Yee,"I guess it's been long enough that you can send a follow up text asking laying out your cards. Something along the lines of reiterating you enjoyed the date and would like to keep talking, but you understand she might feel differently so you just want to know what's up",269,50,11:11:44
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,11:11:16
Ben Fickes,Oh nOOoO what was the advice you gave that he ignored,53,11,11:06:47
Erica Yee,I obviously don't want to just feed him lines but ughh,54,11,11:06:30
Erica Yee,Omg Calvin didn't follow my advice and now he's in a worse/more confusing place (imho) and wants more advice from me,116,21,11:06:02

Erica Yee,N,1,1,10:49:32
Ben Fickes,Thanks for teaching me the expert art of alternating laughs,59,10,10:46:50
Ben Fickes,I actually didnât get unsweetened because that was all they had. And wow nice,79,14,10:46:29

Ben Fickes,I was up late working on networks with Jason,44,9,10:02:26
Ben Fickes,Glad you got some sleep,23,5,10:02:17

Erica Yee,"Ok yeah still gonna go, thanks",30,6,9:36:55
Ben Fickes,Especially if youâre already dressed to go,44,7,9:36:31

Ben Fickes,Does it mean why,16,4,10:23:58
Erica Yee,Oh no I meant about metro,25,6,10:23:53

Erica Yee,TEENAGE DREAM IS PLAYING IN MARINO,34,6,9:42:43

Erica Yee,not a good start to the day,27,7,9:04:57

Erica Yee,But first gotta write the proposal lol,38,7,11:23:41
Erica Yee,So probably gonna do that,25,5,11:23:37
Erica Yee,My ethics professor said we can request to have our proposals moved to the front of his grading queue if we want to work on the essays over break,145,29,11:23:34

Erica Yee,Ok if you're sure..but seriously no pressure,44,7,10:39:18
Ben Fickes,No it's good! Theoretically all will be done by then and I can rest the whole evening,85,17,10:36:20
Erica Yee,"And it's ok actually, I forgot you had so much going on today and want you to rest",82,18,10:32:02
Erica Yee,Yay!,4,1,10:31:14
Ben Fickes,So I can make it to Sophie's thing as long as nothing goes catastrophically wrong,81,15,10:19:18
Ben Fickes,I think I finally got SD working,32,7,10:19:05
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,10:02:43
Erica Yee,And yeah we waved. Had to cuz made direct eye contact while facing each other haha,82,16,10:02:29
Erica Yee,Omg nice,8,2,10:02:04
Ben Fickes,But I think I'm close now,25,6,9:59:18
Ben Fickes,It was so dumb,14,4,9:59:13
Ben Fickes,I just found the bug on soft dev,32,8,9:59:09
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Did you say anything,31,6,9:59:01
Erica Yee,Just ran into my English Prof and his wife (based on looking at his Instagram pics) in front of the gym lol,107,22,9:49:56
Erica Yee,"I'm ok, sleeping 10 hours was nice",34,7,9:49:29
Erica Yee,Oh dang ok,10,3,9:49:14
Ben Fickes,How about you,13,3,9:41:29
Ben Fickes,Feeling better than last night though,37,6,9:41:27
Ben Fickes,"Honestly a little worse than most of yesterday, I started coughing more when it got late",88,16,9:41:21
Erica Yee,How do you feel,15,4,9:40:49
Erica Yee,No worries I have to work too,29,7,9:09:09
Ben Fickes,So there are some issues that came up with soft dev. Iâm gonna try really hard to get it done and we have a late day left and this is the last assignment so maybe thereâs some flexibility there. But Iâll have to work on it some tomorrow. Sorry ð,254,50,1:55:15
Ben Fickes,Goodnight haha,14,2,23:07:04
Erica Yee,"Ok I'm done with this for the night, sleep well too",51,11,23:06:54
Ben Fickes,WHAT why is that important at all,33,7,23:06:49
Erica Yee,But then realized he's jumping the gun a little lol,51,10,23:06:36
Erica Yee,"Or not judging exactly, but saying he doesn't want to date someone who doesn't drink",84,15,23:06:26
Erica Yee,Omg Calvin is judging her for not drinking,42,8,23:06:10
Ben Fickes,"Ah gotcha. I hope you can sleep well and have some time to rest. I really missed you today but also loved getting the pics and stories, so thank you :)",151,31,23:05:36
Erica Yee,"Gonna sleep now, so exhausted lol. Like I haven't felt this need to seriously introvert WHILE socializing in a while but it really hit me this evening. Good thing it was close and chill friends",193,35,23:04:30
Erica Yee,Ah ok no worries,16,4,23:03:21
Ben Fickes,"Aw man Iâm sorry to hear that. So I scheduled a group call with capstone at 6:30, but hopefully that wonât take long and I can go",133,27,23:02:13
Erica Yee,No worries if not cuz I know that's right after volunteering,60,11,23:01:51
Erica Yee,She says it's probably only half an hour,40,8,23:01:43
Erica Yee,Sophie's running it and I want to support her because the president of this club doesn't treat her well or think that her events are good,137,26,23:01:36
Erica Yee,Would you be willing to go to this,34,8,23:01:06
Erica Yee,Ohh sorry gotcha,16,3,23:00:57
Ben Fickes,No worries! Will definitely not be free until like 7 tomorrow. And I meant on Tuesday haha (but if thatâs what you mean too then cool),136,26,22:59:58
Erica Yee,"And I don't have an 8am haha, only 1:35",39,9,22:59:02
Erica Yee,But it's due at 5,17,5,22:58:53
Erica Yee,Oh sorry ... I did not get my assignment done that's actually due tomorrow (stresses me out cuz I almost never leave things like this to the due date..),152,29,22:58:28
Ben Fickes,Assuming soft dev gets done would you want to hang out tomorrow? Know you have an 8 am but we could grab dinner or something?,125,25,22:53:49
Ben Fickes,But guess itâs good we were both busy as opposed to one of us,63,14,22:53:25
Ben Fickes,I was working really hard to try to have time for us to hang out. But itâs just a lot more than I expected (and you were away anyways),136,29,22:53:13
Ben Fickes,Yeah I really missed you too,28,6,22:52:39
Erica Yee,I missed you today,18,4,22:52:03
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think thatâs the right call,36,7,22:50:02
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Sounds promising for him,33,6,22:49:54
Erica Yee,Oh they planned for the 3rd,27,6,22:49:43
Erica Yee,He asked me if he should ask to FaceTime and I was like I'm biased since I'm averse to vid chatting but maybe message a little more first lol,141,29,22:48:53
Erica Yee,They're trying to plan one but she's going out of town for Thanksgiving so probably next week,93,17,22:48:12
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs awesome! Thatâs great they can talk about that stuff. Whenâs the date? Or did they just match but havenât planned a date?,141,24,22:39:59
Erica Yee,They skipped straight to a deep conversation about vulnerability lmao,69,10,22:39:22

Erica Yee,Do you have your air mattress here by any chance,48,10,13:23:35
Erica Yee,But I should follow up,22,5,13:07:30
Erica Yee,"I told them about my experience on the bus there, but then when I saw who was speaking I whispered ""I'm sorry in advance"" to Parker which was probably not the best thing to do lol oops",184,37,13:07:14
Erica Yee,Didn't get a chance to talk to them afterward unfortunately,59,10,13:06:21
Ben Fickes,They visited ccfc last week but left immediately without getting snacks so seems like a bad sign haha,101,18,12:43:24

Ben Fickes,Oh dang sorry to hear that. What was it about?,46,10,12:21:14
Erica Yee,"Conversely I did not really get anything from today's sermon, it was from a campus staff (Northeastern's actually) whom I don't like so think I went in with preconceptions lol",175,30,12:19:47
Ben Fickes,"Okay thanks for the support, think I will stay home",51,10,12:17:52

Erica Yee,It's good to rest,17,4,11:56:36
Ben Fickes,"Iâm having an internal debate. Part of me, since I probably wonât sing or talk to people at church (since I definitely overused my voice yesterday), wants to just stay home and watch the sermon. But I also feel bad about the idea of purposely skipping church",262,47,11:39:58
Erica Yee,Yay thanks,10,2,19:01:17
Ben Fickes,Sorry sorry tuna salad not tuna melt,36,7,18:59:47

Ben Fickes,"Oh also I think RenÃ©e, Ty, Michael and I will get dinner to eat during the second session. Do you want me to get food for you too?",131,28,10:22:50
Ben Fickes,I had a thought on the movie: so they theoretically never find out Roxanne wanted the recipe. But they never talk or think about her again after the date night,159,30,10:17:56
Ben Fickes,Also glad that you can sleep past Dan for once haha,51,11,10:17:18

Ben Fickes,I just asked Jason if heâs ready and he just repeated what I said in a British accent without answering,105,20,17:52:28
Erica Yee,Lol ok,6,2,17:46:16
Ben Fickes,Jason wants to come with too so we will prob be late to meet up with you...,75,17,17:45:27
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing,15,3,17:07:51
Erica Yee,"Sure, we're meeting in Willis lobby at 550 so see you outside?",62,12,17:07:25
Ben Fickes,Do you want to walk to curry together,37,8,17:03:13
Ben Fickes,True friendship,15,2,17:03:07
Erica Yee,I just walked with Viv to whole foods so she could get a dessert,64,14,16:59:21
Erica Yee,Ooh nice!,9,2,16:58:53
Ben Fickes,So my throat actually feels normal now! But I have a cough now haha,67,14,16:46:01
Erica Yee,Haha ok yay,11,3,16:36:36
Ben Fickes,Marcus was raving about the emoji movie so your emoji reply went over well,74,14,16:18:11
Ben Fickes,Nah youâre good,17,3,16:17:57
Erica Yee,wow i should've made more of an effort then,43,9,15:49:33
Ben Fickes,And probably forgot then after haha,35,6,15:48:18
Ben Fickes,Oh he opened it to read the reply out loud to all of us,55,14,15:48:11
Erica Yee,marcus leaves my reply to his no context video on read.. i don't get this boy lol,81,17,15:45:26
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry I can explain later. And awesome thanks :) we will see if it happens again haha,90,18,15:36:11
Erica Yee,"if this ever happens again i'm down to go with, even if it's a double date with marcus",86,18,15:27:45
Erica Yee,i'm *sorta* confused but guess i'll ask in person lol,53,10,15:27:11
Ben Fickes,I asked them how they met though which now in hindsight seems incredibly awkward,80,14,15:23:47
Ben Fickes,"So Marcus when he called me asked if I could come with him because he was going with his friend and her sorta online boyfriend to lunch and didnât want to third wheel. I talked to Marcus after and it turns out that the sorta was about him being her bf (not online, which I had assumed). And by sorta it seems like mostly not dating haha. Anyways retroactively a lot of stuff and the dynamic made more sense, I can tell you in person",434,85,15:23:30
Erica Yee,eh the usual internet outrage,29,5,15:23:01
Ben Fickes,How much controversy haha,25,4,15:21:32
Erica Yee,do tell,7,2,15:21:20
Erica Yee,"there was actually this whole controversy on whether it coudl be considered ""anime""",83,13,15:21:16
Ben Fickes,Okay so I have a bit of a story from spring shabu shabu,55,13,15:21:14
Erica Yee,nah pretty sure it's standalone,31,5,15:21:06
Ben Fickes,So I guess I got clickbaited without the clickbait even being necessary,71,12,15:20:55
Ben Fickes,I assumed it was part of a larger movie or show,47,11,15:20:38
Erica Yee,"i remember there was a clickhole that came out something like ""FULL EXTENDED MOVIE PLANNED OF SHELTER MUSIC VIDEO"" lmao",119,20,15:00:50
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,14:59:58
Ben Fickes,Marcus sent you a video randomly,32,6,14:52:14
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Have you seen the music video?,39,8,14:52:05
Erica Yee,Yesss another Asian girl in english class is playing shelter on the speakers (the song I was trying to play last night lol),123,23,14:39:25
Erica Yee,Weekday hopefully not,21,3,12:05:29
Erica Yee,Lol I was wondering if it was a date thing,42,10,12:05:24
Erica Yee,Ooh I'm glad,12,3,12:05:00
Ben Fickes,Just hoping the wait isnât too long,37,7,12:03:38
Ben Fickes,"Marcus called me and I answered, honestly thinking it was an accident. He asked if I was free in an hour and I said maybe but probably. He explained that his friend met someone online and was going on a date and he agreed to go but didnât want to third wheel. Idk why it was such a big deal but I said sure Iâd go. Then he said âSo... as to where weâre going... itâs spring shabu shabuâ",398,79,12:03:30
Ben Fickes,Okay so gonna type out Marcus story but might have to go for capstone,69,14,12:01:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah actually feeling a lot better today. Throat hurt a lot during the night but feeling a lot better now. And Iâm able to start getting mucus out haha which I think was contributing to how bad my throat was,209,40,11:59:00
Erica Yee,Are you feeling up for it?,26,6,11:58:09
Erica Yee,Good thing it's individual hotpot,33,5,11:58:04
Erica Yee,??,2,1,11:57:47
Ben Fickes,Okay no worries!,16,3,11:57:43
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,11:57:38
Erica Yee,Uh I have class at 1:35 lol,27,7,11:57:15
Ben Fickes,He said you can come if you want but no pressure because I know you have a lot of work,86,20,11:56:22
Ben Fickes,So long story short Marcus just called me and asked (really begged haha) me to go to spring shabu shabu with two of his friends? Sorta long story but I could tell he was really desperate so I said yes... now Iâm going there at 1,230,46,11:55:53
Erica Yee,Ok thanks!,10,2,11:16:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah definitely good to split,29,5,11:12:51
Erica Yee,"No one signed up for plates and cups so I'm gonna buy, if you wanna split (no pressure)",87,18,11:06:55

Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,0:03:22
Ben Fickes,"Well as luck would have it, I actually really like seeing you and spending time around you, even if weâre just working or youâre doing other stuff, so Iâm actually really happy for any time you stay here",209,38,23:57:07

Ben Fickes,And yeah haha def already talked too much tonight,49,9,23:55:44
Ben Fickes,"No worries, I forgot to ask",27,6,23:55:35

Erica Yee,Oh yah sorry forgot to tell you,31,7,23:55:02
Ben Fickes,"Also thanks again for the cough drops. Sorry didnât get to talk to you more, I just know you were working and didnât want to disturb you",140,27,23:53:08

Ben Fickes,I just ate two bowls of ice cream to try to make it feel better haha,68,16,18:24:05
Ben Fickes,Because my throat is the prime/only source of pain with this sickness now,73,13,18:23:52
Ben Fickes,Oh I might take those if you donât mind,41,9,18:23:30

BUT i also randomly had a fun christiany christmas song that i've been jamming to lately queued up. the first few pop songs played, and then the chrstimas song came on. but halfway through the verse, the professor's speaker SHUT OFF CUZ LOW BATTERY. spiritual warfare?? jk but thought it was very coincidental lol",524,92,15:02:39

Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,23:40:53

Erica Yee,Well I use lite so idk about features,37,8,22:59:12
Erica Yee,What would suggest you're into someone on messenger..?,54,8,22:59:04
Erica Yee,Eh I'll tell you in person,26,6,22:58:30
Ben Fickes,But he asked if it happens to me for you and it definitely doesnât,68,14,22:38:05
Ben Fickes,"For him he said yes, when he talks to people about deeper things messenger suggests things that indicate heâs into them",121,21,22:37:46
Ben Fickes,What did you talk about? Generally you donât have to tell me specifics (or generally either if you donât want to haha),122,22,22:37:12
Erica Yee,Lol is this from personal experience,36,6,22:36:26
Erica Yee,"We did have a good ""deeper"" talk after you guys left. I wasn't sure if there was more pat wanted to talk about but it ended up being good and cool that ty was there",164,35,22:36:16
Ben Fickes,And heâs convinced FB messenger tries to guess whom you like,62,11,22:36:00
Ben Fickes,We talked about FB algorithms at dinner,39,7,22:35:42
Ben Fickes,HAHA I would also be shook,26,6,22:35:32
Erica Yee,Literally I think ty spoke more than the rest of us combined I'm shook,70,14,22:35:08
Erica Yee,Haha thanks for sharing,23,4,22:34:56
Ben Fickes,Thatâs all haha,17,3,22:12:03
Ben Fickes,Airpods story,13,2,22:11:59
Ben Fickes,Then ty read through Venmo and said âwell they have interacted very recentlyâ,81,13,21:46:09
Ben Fickes,"He said âare RenÃ©e and Shem together or did they break up like a year ago?â And I didnât say anything, hoping Jason would say something. He didnât. So it was a lot of silence and I just said âI know but Iâm not supposed toâ",238,46,21:45:48
Ben Fickes,I know right? And nice haha,27,6,21:45:07
Erica Yee,They are currently reading math papers,38,6,21:35:56
Erica Yee,Yikes what did you say,22,5,21:35:46
Erica Yee,Uh tipsy ty is so talkative lmao,32,7,21:35:42
Erica Yee,No it's all good,16,4,21:35:29
Ben Fickes,Jason did not reply which makes me thinks he knew too,53,11,21:29:50
Ben Fickes,Then stalked them on Venmo,26,5,21:29:40
Ben Fickes,Ty asked about Shem and RenÃ©e out of the blue,46,10,21:29:34
Ben Fickes,"I know I donât need to apologize but sorry for not staying. Just really felt like going home for some reason, idk why",119,23,21:29:15
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,19:54:09
Ben Fickes,No problem! Weâre at parish cafe (ended up going for dinner and drinks). Jason is here too,92,17,19:42:58

Erica Yee,"We going to Conor's lol, you?",29,6,19:08:54
Erica Yee,Yep yep,7,2,18:40:32
Ben Fickes,Dang that sounds like a hassle. And also really weird that they somehow have it in the current state where they made a max shorter than your password. Thanks for sharing haha,174,32,18:26:53
Erica Yee,The end lol,11,3,17:50:16
Erica Yee,"So I try to change my password on the BOA website, but of COURSE I can't because it doesn't accept my ""current password"" that's longer than 20 characters, even though it obviously will let me log in. End up resetting it even though I know what it is so I can change it to a shorter one...",288,57,17:50:09
Erica Yee,"Finally after much back and forth, a help person for the first website told me BOA passwords can't be longer than 20 characters...but mine currently is and works!!",163,28,17:48:43
Erica Yee,"this website that I connect my bank account to needed me to update my account info. I kept trying to log in but it said this information doesn't match any BOA record. I knew this had to be false because if i go to the BOA website directly, I can log in with the exact same credentials",284,57,17:46:07
Erica Yee,Nothing that interesting lol,28,4,17:43:48
Ben Fickes,Since itâs their voice banking software,41,6,16:42:09
Ben Fickes,And they intrinsically trust anyone named Erica,47,7,16:41:59
Ben Fickes,Itâs because your name is Erica,33,6,16:41:50
Ben Fickes,Iâm actually incredibly curious haha,38,5,16:41:45
Erica Yee,Like idk how such a huge financial institution allowed my edge case to happen lol,81,15,16:34:14
Erica Yee,Don't have time to type it out now by just dealt with the dumbest software bug on the bank of America website ever,114,23,16:33:51

Erica Yee,Hope that makes sense haha,26,5,17:27:27
Erica Yee,"Also don't think I finished what I was trying to say on the couch. Basically when I was trying to decide whether to go back home from WVG or ask to visit you, I knew I needed some restful time after feeling drained (but of course I'm glad I could talk with Viv and Danni even tho and also because it was challenging). Although I wouldn't say spending time with you is physically energizing, it is comforting and enjoyable and makes me happy. So I chose to ask if you were free because I wanted to spend time with you, not out of obligation from tentatively naming Saturday afternoon the other day",596,112,17:27:23
Erica Yee,So Renee is DMimg?,18,4,17:23:00

Erica Yee,Hahaha omg should've sent one of those,38,7,19:36:23
Erica Yee,Idk but hurts when I walk,25,6,19:36:15
Ben Fickes,Suggested replies to that message were âAnytimeâ and âYouâre welcomeâ,79,10,19:27:35
Ben Fickes,Dang that sounds bad. Hopefully not as bad as elbow though?,59,11,19:27:14
Erica Yee,Think I bruised my pinkie toe moderately badly lol,50,9,19:25:25
Erica Yee,ahh ok yikes,12,3,14:54:15
Ben Fickes,Or maybe I lost internet or something? Never seen it grayed out though,70,13,14:52:53
Ben Fickes,I'm sure it's handled differently behind the scenes,51,8,14:52:37
Ben Fickes,It could be an ios thing,24,6,14:52:21
Erica Yee,i clicked one and was go all the way to confirm purchase from my google pay account,83,17,14:52:07
Ben Fickes,Like all the purchase buttons are grayed out,44,8,14:51:44
Erica Yee,how can you tell,16,4,14:50:52
Erica Yee,what do you mean down,21,5,14:50:51
Ben Fickes,Probably not good for their revenue...,38,6,14:40:35
Ben Fickes,checked SEGA heroes during a break and it looks like all the monetary purchases are down,88,16,14:40:17

Ben Fickes,"I have never seen the notebook but thanks for sharing, I'll listen later :)",75,14,14:09:13
Erica Yee,and ooh ok. you've also like designed imaginary worlds before anyway haha. i actually listened to a cool podcast on that by a scifi writer a while ago,150,28,14:07:46
Erica Yee,know you're in class but if you want to listen later,52,11,14:07:11
Erica Yee,also very random but i'm listening to this song and the overall sentiment reminds me of us haha (not specific references..also idk if you've ever seen the notebook..)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmOJujBVvvM,211,29,14:07:02
Ben Fickes,But also seems interesting,26,4,14:06:22
Ben Fickes,Heard it's pretty chill,23,4,14:06:14
Ben Fickes,"yeah I get what you mean, it's a game design course so I think not",66,15,14:06:08
Erica Yee,"not the right word, but like not coding?",40,8,14:04:26

Ben Fickes,Hmmmm okay. I might ask her about it,36,8,13:55:27
Erica Yee,uh some young chinese guy,25,5,13:55:00
Erica Yee,but think she learned a lot,27,6,13:54:55
Erica Yee,she said don't take it unless you know you want to do something with AI in the future (like don't just take it as a fun elective),129,27,13:54:47
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Oh no. Do you know who her prof was?,47,11,13:54:28
Erica Yee,it made her cry at some points (iirc),37,8,13:53:55

Erica Yee,Idk what that is but ðð,29,6,11:57:40

Erica Yee,The blueberry lemon one is good (if I don't get a cankersore lol),65,13,11:54:27

Erica Yee,It's like drinking liquid basil lmao,36,6,11:49:37
Erica Yee,I just went to my friends' rethink your drink station at curry crossroads where they're giving out infused water. But they think Rebecca's made the recipes wrong because the herbs are SO STRONG,193,33,11:49:30
Erica Yee,Since I'm sabbathing tomorrow,29,4,11:48:31
Erica Yee,Was planning on working a lot,29,6,11:48:26
Erica Yee,Yeah only have Jiu-Jitsu at 515,31,6,11:48:17
Erica Yee,Because of a development 23 years later,39,7,11:47:54
Ben Fickes,Also do you wanna hang out sometime today? Idk your schedule,60,11,11:30:37

Erica Yee,I almost threw my phone across the room,39,8,10:52:44
Erica Yee,I'll tell you in person haha,28,6,10:52:07
Erica Yee,Yeah I told you when she first told me about it and now it's today,66,15,10:51:49
Ben Fickes,Was honestly kinda hoping it'd be bad/ridiculous so I could hear about it haha,78,14,10:02:14
Ben Fickes,And what is it? Super curious haha,34,7,10:01:50
Ben Fickes,Wait I think I heard about the award - this is the one she was thinking about the speech for awhile?,100,21,10:01:41
Erica Yee,I finished the book with the two epilogues and the ending is SO BAD/RIDICULOUS omg,82,15,9:37:48
Erica Yee,"Lol it's ok. My mom is good, giving an award speech for a coworker (boss?) who's a close Christian friend today. Also going to LA Thanksgiving weekend with another co-worker to help her clean out the house of her brother who passed away (lots of antique guns apparently??)",272,48,7:50:16
Ben Fickes,"Sorry I didnât ask earlier, I thought things were bad because of the wisdom thing but realize now thatâs not about her",122,22,23:07:40
Ben Fickes,Howâs your mom?,17,3,23:07:18
Ben Fickes,Sheâs good. Excited for thanksgiving. And she asked about you,63,10,23:07:14
Erica Yee,How's your mom,14,3,22:49:35
Erica Yee,LOL omg,7,2,22:47:49
Ben Fickes,I called my mom because Jason was talking to his dad and I was inspired by that and you calling your mom. Matt heard us and called his parents. We all finished but Iâm pretty sure Dan is on the phone now with his family haha,226,46,22:38:04
Ben Fickes,Of course,9,2,20:54:33
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,20:54:26
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing,15,3,20:50:33
Ben Fickes,Oh oh oh,8,3,20:50:30
Erica Yee,Sorry was unclear,17,3,20:45:59
Erica Yee,"Oh no, meant the conversation with danni",40,7,20:45:53
Ben Fickes,Yeah of course. Her as in your mom?,35,8,20:44:05
Erica Yee,Yeah but if you could pray for wisdom for her (and don't tell her please) that would be appreciated,99,19,20:43:33
Ben Fickes,Okay. Is everything okay?,25,4,20:40:52
Erica Yee,We had a very long intense talk about something that I'll tell you in person (maybe),84,16,20:40:09
Erica Yee,And am now in a Ryder classroom with danni,42,9,20:39:52
Erica Yee,My mom called so we talked,26,6,20:39:37
Erica Yee,Oh yay I'm glad,15,4,20:39:31
Ben Fickes,"Also Lutheran group was interesting, Iâll tell you about it in person",71,12,20:09:49
Ben Fickes,"Jason and I went to the gym together, it was good",49,11,20:09:32
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,16:25:00
Ben Fickes,Theyâll do a c section and just get my stomach instead of a child,67,14,16:24:09
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good you can just give birth and then we'll have everything covered,77,14,16:23:35
Ben Fickes,We have to fight the patriarchy by you taking care of all life burdens Iâll ever have including financial,107,19,16:00:45
Erica Yee,What I thought it was gonna be the other way around dude,56,12,15:51:29
Ben Fickes,(no pressure...),16,2,15:50:12
Ben Fickes,Maybe overall industry pay is rising and youâll make so much I never need to get a job ever,93,19,15:49:58
Erica Yee,yeah likely. guess it's good that some journalists are getting paid well. just seems absurdly high compared to what you hear about the industry,143,24,15:45:23
Ben Fickes,Dang that is a lot. It is SF though so I guess that might account for some of it?,81,19,15:43:25
Erica Yee,i feel like that could be 3 times what newspaper reporters make with the same amoutn of experience,98,18,15:42:35
Erica Yee,"very random but i was looking at this anonymous google sheets where journalists share their salaries. and i'm pretty know which one is the developer at the chronicle who joined the last week i was there, and he apparently makes $90k ?!?!??!?!!?",244,42,15:42:11
Erica Yee,Ooh true ok,11,3,12:18:05
Ben Fickes,I guess we do have a ton of runs to use though,46,12,12:16:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah you prob are. But also it assumes you have more people fighting it,71,14,12:16:33
Erica Yee,Cuz I just checked and it's level 40+ suggested so I feel I should be good now at 51,84,19,12:15:30
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,12:14:59
Ben Fickes,Eh letâs save class 2 until the boss season starts,52,10,12:06:21
Ben Fickes,I mean Iâm down but I know I can not get killed by them,57,14,12:06:09
Ben Fickes,Hasnât come out yet but the plan was at one time a special boss,65,14,12:05:56
Erica Yee,Do you think we can try class 2 again,37,9,12:05:35
Erica Yee,Oh what it's that new?!,23,5,12:03:51

Erica Yee,Oh also realized i forgot to show you my nu sci article lol oh well,67,15,2:34:55

Ben Fickes,Wait you were? Dang thatâs absolutely crazy,45,7,2:31:42
Erica Yee,"But it's ok. Thanks for reassuring me, it means a lot",53,11,2:30:18

Erica Yee,Yah please don't feel stressed on my account,44,8,12:58:11

Ben Fickes,Oh I have a coding challenge to do too,38,9,12:54:01
Ben Fickes,I couldnât remember haha. Okay that makes me feel a little less stressed about getting it done,96,17,12:53:55
Erica Yee,Or I know I should,18,5,12:43:58
Erica Yee,At least some,13,3,12:43:54
Erica Yee,Oh I thought we were meeting up to work,39,9,12:43:49
Ben Fickes,Hopefully I'll get it done earlier though,41,7,12:35:53
Ben Fickes,Might have to work briefly toight (I volunteered for more capstone stuff) but can still meet up,95,17,12:35:29
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,12:35:12
Erica Yee,Ok that + the dream is enough negative emotion for the day,58,12,12:31:33
Erica Yee,That's true lol,15,3,12:31:02
Ben Fickes,Yeah that does make sense,25,5,12:30:49
Ben Fickes,Okay this is kinda sad but if it was her and you don't completely notice I'm sure it'll happen again and you'll probably be more certain,136,26,12:30:42
Erica Yee,I really can't know. But my initial gut reaction was so strong that I don't want to completely disregard it if that makes sense,127,24,12:30:41
Erica Yee,Ugh idk... But whatever not gonna change my behavior,52,9,12:29:33
Ben Fickes,Okay glad to hear that actually,31,6,12:29:26
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,12:29:19
Erica Yee,Ok now that I've thought about it a little more I think it's more plausible that I just misremembered how much water I put in...nvmd lol,136,26,12:28:47
Ben Fickes,Dang that's the most passive aggressive thing I've ever heard,61,10,12:28:44
Erica Yee,Not gonna tell my roommates cuz I have no evidence and am not completely sure but ugh,85,17,12:20:14
Erica Yee,"Ok I might be crazy, but between showering and drying my hair, I put water in my kettle to boil. That's also when I said hello to m cuz I didn't see her when I first went to shower. After drying my hair, I am the only one in the apartment. And I'm _pretty sure_ there was a lot less water than I initially boiled. And this kettle doesn't have the same lid problem as the other one. so if I'm not completely making this up or remembering wrong, think m might've taken some of ""my"" water. And of course when I put it out weeks ago I said ""feel free to use it"" but I just feel like this was on purpose....",602,123,12:19:45
Ben Fickes,Yikes indeed. And oh thatâs right,35,6,12:16:41
Erica Yee,No he doesn't have an id other than his passport,48,10,12:00:12
Erica Yee,It was red and I felt it in my bed... And then no one could catch it by the time I woke up yikes,96,24,11:59:50
Ben Fickes,He didn't lose his id or anything?,34,7,11:58:06
Ben Fickes,Dang how bad was the snake? And double dang to both,51,11,11:57:59
Erica Yee,In other news Victor lost his wallet .. most valuable thing was good t pass though,82,16,11:57:46
Erica Yee,I said hello to Mary and she ignored me,39,9,11:57:02
Erica Yee,I had this intensive dream we had a snake in our apartment,58,12,11:40:11
Erica Yee,Oops. Really late lol,21,4,11:40:00

Erica Yee,and i'm not usually into 3taal,30,6,14:42:31
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,14:42:30
Erica Yee,i think it's a great idea,25,6,14:40:48
Ben Fickes,HAHA part of my reasoning though is that people have the freedom to not lie or not actually say anything about themselves haha,126,23,14:39:53
Erica Yee,LOL JK,6,2,14:38:44
Erica Yee,The real Christians won't lie,29,5,14:38:43
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,14:38:29
Ben Fickes,so just 3 truths or lies,24,6,14:37:17
Ben Fickes,2 truths and a lie but number of lies in unspecified,52,11,14:37:09
Ben Fickes,So I think that's him supporting it,35,7,14:36:58
Ben Fickes,I suggested one and then Michael gave feedback and then stopped responding,74,12,14:36:51
Erica Yee,What's the game,15,3,14:36:30
Erica Yee,Oh really haha,14,3,14:36:27

Ben Fickes,Nice :) I just remembered Iâm emcee tomorrow,46,8,23:44:15
Erica Yee,I committed my work tho so can show Prof if github behaves,58,12,23:43:46
Ben Fickes,Iâm so proud of you ð hope you sleep well haha,51,11,23:43:18
Erica Yee,But gotta sleep so this is a tomorrow problem,45,9,23:42:49
Erica Yee,Oops guess who somehow broke python globally,44,7,23:42:44
Ben Fickes,If you want me try to help I can but idk how I could,52,14,23:33:45
Ben Fickes,Oh sorry dang,13,3,23:33:33
Erica Yee,Meant then error is back* haha,30,6,23:19:22
Erica Yee,(not anymore),13,2,23:19:18
Ben Fickes,Of course haha glad itâs working,34,6,23:15:46
Erica Yee,Oh it's ok just thanks for listening haha,41,8,23:14:47
Erica Yee,Oh wait it worked and then it's back,36,8,23:14:41
Erica Yee,I might've fixed it?,20,4,23:14:34
Ben Fickes,Huh thatâs really weird. Sorry I donât really used pipenv so idk,68,12,23:14:23
Erica Yee,But no idea why it would break out of nowhere if I didn't even install/uninstall anything,89,16,23:00:19
Erica Yee,Ok I can run jupyter globally so it must be pipenv not python itself,68,14,22:59:56
Erica Yee,Can't run anything with pipenv command (and my whole life is in jupyter notebooks so uh),88,16,22:45:41
Ben Fickes,Dang what? Do you get an error or it says python isnât installed or something?,80,15,22:38:16
Erica Yee,Like I can't run things I'm so confused,39,8,22:37:42
Erica Yee,But my python suddenly just broke or something,46,8,22:37:35
Erica Yee,"It was going pretty well, got at least some deliverables to show my professor tomorrow",86,15,22:37:25
Erica Yee,Ah nice,7,2,22:37:02
Ben Fickes,Howâs your evening?,21,3,22:35:25
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. Also I saw ty and Angela! They were walking by and stopped to say hi to me before Melina arrived,109,22,22:35:14
Erica Yee,See you got so much done haha,29,7,22:33:26
Erica Yee,Ooh wowow,9,2,22:33:15
Ben Fickes,So now I basically just have networks,37,7,22:32:38
Ben Fickes,Kenny didnât meet with us but worked and is apparently almost done with his part too,86,16,22:32:30
Ben Fickes,Melina volunteered to do that so Iâm going back,49,9,22:31:56
Ben Fickes,Sorta haha. We thought it worked but it says a different player one than in his example. So we have to verify if his or ours is incorrect,137,28,22:31:43
Erica Yee,That's great! Did you guys finish?,34,6,22:29:08
Ben Fickes,Soft Dev went really well,25,5,22:26:42
Ben Fickes,Dang lemme know how the talk goes please,40,8,22:26:30
Erica Yee,"no response to my message, oh well i tried",42,9,20:03:48
Erica Yee,Idk about that but thanks haha,30,6,19:38:31
Ben Fickes,Hope things get sorted out later and I know you are a kind person but hope she doesnât take advantage of you,110,22,19:33:08
Ben Fickes,I can imagine that very clearly haha,36,7,19:32:19
Erica Yee,"""I HAVE SO MANY AXES TO THROW BUT JESUS IS HOLDING ME BACK""",59,13,19:31:42
Erica Yee,B is about to explode right now,31,7,19:31:25
Erica Yee,"Nah just trying to defuse/change the subject so b and s will ""read"" the message lol",83,16,19:31:09
Ben Fickes,Dang. Sorry. And wow you are very kind and gracious in your replies,67,13,19:29:56
Erica Yee,After,5,1,19:29:09
Ben Fickes,She stormed out when you got there or before?,45,9,19:29:05
Erica Yee,And then she stormed out,24,5,19:28:53
Erica Yee,"Yeah she was (b says before I came back m ""tried"" to rearrange by halfheartedly tapping on stuff)",97,18,19:28:42
Ben Fickes,Is she there,12,3,19:23:06
Ben Fickes,Why am I not surprised,22,5,19:23:03
Erica Yee,LMAO b and I just spent 2 mins arranging stuff and it all fits perfectly fine,77,16,19:12:35
Ben Fickes,Will be at soft Dev meeting in half an hour though so may not reply immediately,79,16,19:07:56
Ben Fickes,If you need to vent or talk about anything Iâm here,53,11,19:07:31
Ben Fickes,Hope it goes okay,17,4,19:07:21
Ben Fickes,"Donât worry, there is another in the fire",43,8,19:07:16
Erica Yee,Heading into the fire now cuz gotta cook dinner..,49,9,19:06:51
Erica Yee,Thanks..,8,1,19:06:31
Ben Fickes,"Donât think you have to apologize if she confronts you, idk what portion of the freezer you use (Iâm guessing itâs not all of it) but even if it is thatâs not on you to guess she has an issue with it",207,42,19:05:20
Ben Fickes,Idk what to say or how to reply,31,8,19:04:40
Ben Fickes,On many different levels what she said is really messed up,58,11,19:03:37
Ben Fickes,Geez sorry I donât even know what to say to this,50,11,19:02:51
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,19:02:36
Erica Yee,(no one has replied still but she confronted b at home apparently),66,12,19:01:51
Erica Yee,"Because you guys have never made any effort to divide it. I went grocery shopping today and bought a few things to freeze and there is LEGIT NO ROOM. I bought two packs of one thing that if I don't freeze they will expand and explode, and it was way too difficult to try and find space to fit TWO things. If you guys like your frozen asian food too much and don't wanna share space, that's fine, but let me know so i can buy my own mini fridge or something. I didn't say anything before as I was like ""oh they seem normal, they'll figure it out"" but this is getting ridiculous",576,114,19:01:32
Ben Fickes,Yes please,10,2,19:01:14
Erica Yee,It is quite something,21,4,18:59:27
Erica Yee,WOW wanna read the entire follow-up message,43,7,18:59:25
Ben Fickes,Donât think you have to reply in the chat,43,9,18:45:27
Ben Fickes,Idk maybe just tell her youâre not using that much of the freezer? If she brings it up,88,18,18:45:20
Ben Fickes,Sigh,4,1,18:44:53
Erica Yee,And guessing she's home lol,27,5,18:43:30
Erica Yee,No but I guess I need to soon because I need to go back to cook dinner,70,17,18:43:23
Ben Fickes,Did anyone reply,16,3,18:41:41
Ben Fickes,Not really,10,2,18:41:33
Ben Fickes,You should say âno I had no ideaâ,37,8,18:41:30
Ben Fickes,Geez major yikes,16,3,18:41:21
Erica Yee,"Yikes Mary (whom I haven't seen since Friday morning) just texted group chat ""are you guys aware that our freezer is meant for 4 people""",136,25,18:29:01
Ben Fickes,Will do :),10,3,18:21:46
Erica Yee,"Trying capstone again, please pray for me lol",45,8,17:46:32
Erica Yee,Thanks for bringing it up,25,5,17:46:18
Ben Fickes,Sometimes I do it earlier but sometimes I donât so thanks :),62,12,17:43:19
Erica Yee,Yeah sure! I've actually been doing it earlier recently but I like doing it at the end of the day more if I can,111,24,17:42:54
Ben Fickes,"Also completely unrelated (Iâm saying that a lot today) but I have a proposal I thought of last night: when we meet up at night can we bring journals and do devo time? Can be individual, Iâve just noticed the nights that I miss journaling and devo time are frequently when we stay up late together",301,56,17:35:59
Erica Yee,Yikes,5,1,17:33:16
Erica Yee,LOLOL,5,1,17:33:14
Ben Fickes,Tfti once again ððð,28,4,17:31:09
Ben Fickes,Just overheard Jason on the phone with Rachel: âMolly and Dara are good for dinnerâ,87,15,17:30:53
Ben Fickes,"Thank you for your support, it means a lot :)",45,10,17:22:10
Erica Yee,good job :),11,3,16:58:25
Erica Yee,that's amazing!,15,2,16:58:19
Ben Fickes,I finished capstone and networks homework so really just have the project and soft Dev,86,15,16:49:15
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,16:49:00
Erica Yee,i'm basically writing almost my entire review due friday instead of doing capstone stuff for tomorrow lol,105,17,16:44:33
Erica Yee,and oh no rush,14,4,16:44:10
Erica Yee,thanks,6,1,16:44:05
Ben Fickes,"Unrelatedly, I realized I still have your oatmeal. When do you need it? I can bring it by later if you need it today",116,24,16:43:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think so,15,4,16:42:52
Erica Yee,"The book covers a wide variety of topics, from journalism's #MeToo reckoning, to newsroom maternity leave policies, to industry changes wrought by the digital era.",163,25,16:33:26
Erica Yee,"is the word ""wrought"" used correctly here?",42,7,16:33:18
Erica Yee,Whoa you right,14,3,15:33:48
Ben Fickes,"23 years is also long in general, like neither of us are even that old",70,15,15:26:36
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,15:26:17
Erica Yee,I'll let you know how it goes haha,34,8,15:19:37
Erica Yee,I think they're gonna end up together but 23 years in the future is obscenely long for the genre lol,100,20,15:19:29
Ben Fickes,Dang. Hmmm do you think the 23 years later is them together? Or do you think they donât end up together but run into each other?,130,26,15:15:42
Erica Yee,The perfect chemistry book that I didn't read yet. Those epilogue times lol..,77,13,15:12:27
Erica Yee,Early college I'm guessing,26,4,14:49:34
Erica Yee,I wish I could see when I opened the account,44,10,14:49:24
Ben Fickes,Okay well maybe for Halloween and thanksgiving then?,52,8,14:48:36
Ben Fickes,There goes my theory,20,4,14:48:12
Erica Yee,It's mostly candy and pie,25,5,14:48:10
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,14:48:07
Ben Fickes,So you probably got a ton of candy and cake for just having it,62,14,14:48:04
Erica Yee,Nah I have one cake lol,23,6,14:47:57
Ben Fickes,Iâm guessing you get one on each birthday (since we got candy on Halloween). And your account is really old right?,116,21,14:47:50
Ben Fickes,You have a lot of cakes right?,30,7,14:47:21
Ben Fickes,Oh very random but I think I know why you have so much food in Habitica,71,16,14:47:11
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,12:28:16
Erica Yee,Ooh ok you can do it,20,6,12:21:28
Ben Fickes,Yeah but now I feel better again haha. Cuz donât know if I can get everything done today which was sorta my goal. But I reminded myself I donât have anything due until Thursday so idk why I feel like I have to get it all done now,233,48,12:11:19
Erica Yee,About work?,11,2,12:08:43
Ben Fickes,Feeling more nervous now haha,29,5,11:59:31
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,11:38:56
Erica Yee,Ooh yau,7,2,11:38:53
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm glad :) Iâm good right now. Slept in a lot haha. Feeling better about work for some reason too,107,21,11:15:33
Erica Yee,How are you,11,3,11:10:09
Erica Yee,I'm pretty good I think? Hopefully more mentally clear,54,9,11:10:04
Erica Yee,Nah in this case I would rather stay up a little later and fall right asleep instead of laying in bed again,107,22,11:09:46
Ben Fickes,Of course! I just feel bad that you were so tired and Iâm worried that I kept you up. How are you feeling now?,112,24,11:09:01
Erica Yee,Thanks for staying up with me haha,34,7,11:08:15
Erica Yee,Think I fell asleep as soon as I got in bed which was really nice,65,15,11:08:10
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,10:41:03
Ben Fickes,Back btw,8,2,3:23:48
Ben Fickes,Here,4,1,19:28:31
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,19:27:41
Ben Fickes,Omw,3,1,19:24:52
Erica Yee,And don't have to bring cookies haha,36,7,19:13:08
Erica Yee,Ok lemme know when you're here,30,6,19:12:51
Ben Fickes,I donât have scones but Matt did make cookies actually,56,10,19:12:29
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! Wow thatâs very risquÃ©,42,7,19:12:18
Erica Yee,B says you can come only if you bring scones lmao,49,11,19:01:08
Erica Yee,No one's home rn though b and s are at the gym,46,12,19:00:52
Erica Yee,Would you be ok coming over? I don't want to put on more clothes lol,68,15,19:00:38
Ben Fickes,Whose place?,12,2,18:58:46
Ben Fickes,Weâre leaving five guys now,29,5,18:58:41
Erica Yee,Oh yikes,8,2,18:05:15
Ben Fickes,They changed the site to make t harder,38,8,17:59:58
Ben Fickes,Jason and I have been working on networks and finally got to login,66,13,17:59:51
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,17:59:38
Erica Yee,I've been listening to the podcast assigned for Tuesday and playing sega heroes so... productive,96,15,17:53:50
Erica Yee,Ooh you got this,16,4,17:53:26
Ben Fickes,By my previous rate of work itâs unlikely but I wanna at least try,68,14,17:52:39
Ben Fickes,My goal for tonight is to finish the paper,42,9,17:52:24
Ben Fickes,Always happy to affirm haha,27,5,17:52:16
Erica Yee,Yess the affirmation I needed,29,5,17:51:01
Ben Fickes,Yeah I feel like itâs better to push it than to try but get nothing done,74,16,17:49:03
Erica Yee,Might regret it but really feel like I can't think fully today,62,12,17:48:36
Erica Yee,I kinda want to push my hardest stuff that takes the most thinking (capstone) to tomorrow,89,16,17:48:20
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Hope itâs a good meal. I also have very little motivation haha,73,14,17:43:18
Erica Yee,Haven't had a full meal today so eating now which hopefully will help,69,13,17:07:42
Erica Yee,Very little motivation to do stuff,34,6,17:07:13
Erica Yee,Alive and able to stay awake,28,6,17:06:52
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling now,23,5,17:02:24
Erica Yee,I took an hour and a half nap..,31,8,16:37:46
Erica Yee,Glad you had a good talk,24,6,16:37:29
Erica Yee,Yeah of course! Don't rush please,33,6,16:37:17
Ben Fickes,Weâre gonna go to 5 guys at 6 so is it okay if I meet up to work with you a little later? Maybe 7? Sorry...,109,26,16:34:10
Ben Fickes,Had a really good deep talk with roommates. Will tell you more later,68,13,16:33:49
Erica Yee,Oh dang ok,10,3,15:27:00
Ben Fickes,"But I hope I can next week, maybe heâll be in his office",58,13,13:48:37
Ben Fickes,And I really wanted to talk to him but didnt know how to without being awkward and ended up just leaving,104,21,13:48:25
Ben Fickes,But at the end pastor Larry said today is the anniversary of his sons death,75,15,13:48:01
Ben Fickes,"Sermon was eh, about giving money",33,6,13:47:44
Ben Fickes,"Sabrina, Justin, Parker, and Emily all came",43,7,13:47:26
Erica Yee,"Sorry didn't ask, how was church for you",40,8,13:39:07
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,13:39:01
Ben Fickes,Dang sorry for both of you,26,6,13:38:04
Erica Yee,Ran into barbs/Sophie/Viv on the way back and Sophie said she couldn't sleep either after drinking boba and heard me tossing and turning..we should've talked to each other haha,176,29,13:37:32
Erica Yee,No lol,6,2,13:36:36
Ben Fickes,Dang are you gonna be able to stay awake the whole day though? And wow thatâs impressive haha,95,18,13:19:49
Erica Yee,Oh btw I helped setup a little with Christian from IV cuz I was early and he remembered I was away on co-op in New York?! Don't think I ever talked to him about it haha,168,36,13:19:00
Erica Yee,Ugh I'm falling sleep on the bus but also napping is what got me in this state in the first place yikes,103,22,13:17:40
Erica Yee,Nice,4,1,13:16:59
Ben Fickes,Which helps me a ton haha,25,6,13:16:35
Ben Fickes,"Iâll eat around 6 prob. And nope, no volunteering",51,9,13:16:29
Erica Yee,Are you volunteering tomorrow btw?,34,5,13:16:08
Erica Yee,I'll probably eat before 6 actually but you def don't need to,61,12,13:15:26
Erica Yee,Ok cool,7,2,13:15:04
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha, I have some leftovers to eat too",49,10,13:14:28
Erica Yee,But don't have enough for you sorry,35,7,13:14:08
Erica Yee,And need to eat leftovers,25,5,13:14:00
Erica Yee,I literally have eaten out for every meal since Thursday lol,60,11,13:13:53
Ben Fickes,Do you want to have dinner together? And is 6 okay haha,55,12,13:11:21
Erica Yee,So probably like 6 haha sounds good,35,7,12:59:17
Ben Fickes,Dang haha unfortunate,21,3,12:58:11
Ben Fickes,Yeah that sounds good. Jason said heâll be home at 2 and Dan will be home at 4. So maybe Jason and I can work until 4 and then we can talk and then you and I can meet up?,172,40,12:58:01
Erica Yee,I think first service was actually better overall lmao because drummer's headphones fell off during second service so spoken signals and drum did not line up,157,26,12:57:49
Erica Yee,Just heading back now,21,4,12:57:11
Erica Yee,Ok should we wait till after you work and talk with Jason then?,63,13,12:57:02
Ben Fickes,Sorry was walking. Yeah Iâd love to! So need to work on networks with Jason and he also wants to just talk about life. He wonât be back until like 2 I think. So at some point will not be able to work but I have a lot of work to do so definitely down to work a lot,267,59,11:49:51
Erica Yee,But maybe we could get a classroom or something,47,9,10:57:59
Erica Yee,Might not reply for a while gtg soon,36,8,10:57:47
Erica Yee,Do you want to do work together later?,38,8,10:57:22
Erica Yee,"I didn't know how much ""in depth"" is needed / how you come up with stuff without knowing anything about the setting or story haha",129,25,10:57:14
Ben Fickes,Ooh nice! No worries if you forget though,41,8,10:55:48
Erica Yee,Didn't write it down so hopefully I remember,44,8,10:52:21
Erica Yee,While I was laying in bed wide awake I did think of some background and personality stuff for my d&d character though,117,22,10:51:18
Erica Yee,Dang thanks,11,2,10:50:43
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad :) and I typed it out as soon as I woke up so I could tell it all to you haha,88,23,10:50:32
Erica Yee,Also how do you remember such detail..,38,7,10:49:31
Erica Yee,"Just read the dreams, what the lol",34,7,10:49:23
Erica Yee,So far thankfully lol,21,4,10:49:17
Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâm so sorry. Are you doing okay?,41,9,10:48:27
Erica Yee,I'll tell you more later but I think I slept a total of 4 hours lol,67,16,10:46:26
Erica Yee,First service went pretty well I think,38,7,10:44:27
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs right. No worries, hope it goes well",48,9,10:44:10
Erica Yee,So not walking,14,3,10:43:38
Erica Yee,But staying for 11am service,28,5,10:43:30
Erica Yee,Didn't read earlier messages yet,32,5,10:43:15
Ben Fickes,"Church just ended, still gonna get snacks and I know youâre probably cleaning up etc",86,15,10:35:46
Ben Fickes,Are you walking back?,21,4,10:35:28
Ben Fickes,Also how are you doing today (sorry for not asking first),57,11,7:53:47
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening haha,25,4,7:36:21
Ben Fickes,Oh there was a third guy too. And when the other guy was playing and went around the room in the game there was this creepy part of the game where sonic started seeing the faces of these two boys he didnât like in everything. And then when the guy stopped playing those faces appeared all over in the arcade. Anyways thatâs when I was like âI should wake upâ and my alarm went off,388,75,7:36:16
Ben Fickes,"In that dream, I was at a movie theater with an arcade. First, my dad told me how to get to the theater when the movie started. âRight, then left, then right into the dead end hallway. Match exactly 8 colors of clothes in the closet, and make sure to use the heavy door.â (There was creepy music playing as he said that). But then I decided to play a sonic game at the arcade. You were tiny sonic trying to get to the top of a tower. But you could also climb things in the room around the tower to try to get higher. I tried climbing this cabinet and jumping to the tower but realized I could go straight for the tower just as easily so started doing that. But I kept dying near the top of the tower. Eventually another guy came and played and asked me if I wanted to know how to play. I said I already knew. He went for the cabinet and did these crazy stunts (in that game sonic can follow streams of water?) but still died near the top of the tower. I asked why he didnât just go straight for the tower and he said âoh, thatâs how you get the silver chest. Iâm going for the platinum one.â",1105,219,7:34:13
Ben Fickes,"I had an absolutely wild dream. So first off, my family and your family were both going to the Grand Canyon together. We just walked around a ton. Then we ran into one of my friends from high school and before I could say anything you said, âOh, Vinay, Ben has told me so much about you!â And he said, âSame to you, Erica!â And his gf from high school (pretty sure they are not dating anymore) and his ânew gfâ (not a real person in my dream) were there. I asked him if heâd be home for thanksgiving and he just said âWhat, are you?â really condescendingly. Anyways we decided to stop to rest in a random house we found which is when I had a dream inside my dream haha",686,132,7:28:47
Ben Fickes,"Thank you Erica, that means a lot :)",36,8,7:24:39
Erica Yee,"The other day when you were saying you don't do anything beside school and I said you do IV/open table, I forgot to say your volunteering at the after school program and church! Really admire you for that",204,38,5:08:41
Ben Fickes,Of course ð thank you for everything too. You are amazing,60,11,22:04:14
Erica Yee,For everything ð,19,3,21:59:04
Erica Yee,Thank you so much,17,4,21:59:00
Ben Fickes,Hope you sleep well and glad youâre feeling a bit better,58,11,21:50:37

Ben Fickes,Oh that would be really nice actually :) but no pressure if you wanna relax in Boston. And dang do you at least know the where?,127,26,19:24:02
Erica Yee,"Cuz she texted ""hi I'm Rachel from worship team"" but there's multiple rachels",77,13,19:23:12
Erica Yee,Also fun fact I don't actually know whose house I'm going to,60,12,19:22:58
Erica Yee,But only if you want. Maybe if would benefit from relaxing few days in Boston..idk,82,15,19:21:43
Erica Yee,Well do you have any desire to visit new York? We could try to see Albert and siukay,84,18,19:21:06
Ben Fickes,"I donât have any idea what Iâm doing haha. Iâd love to spend time with you but also no pressure, itâs fine to spend time with Vivian too",144,28,19:18:36
Erica Yee,But before I ask Vivian for sure I wanted to see what you were doing because I want to spend time with you if possible,118,25,19:16:46
Erica Yee,"Cuz i threw around the idea of visiting Vivian a long time ago and my mom just reminded me, cuz if I was to go to New York the first half of the week I would need to book a flight to New Orleans from there",205,46,19:15:59
Erica Yee,Random but do you have any idea what you're doing for spring break,66,13,19:14:56

Erica Yee,Also did not practice at all whatsoever..,41,7,18:59:51
Erica Yee,"So feeling better enough to go all the way to Cambridge, though I know I'm not going to be able to sleep at 9 like I was planning to now lol",140,31,18:59:34
Erica Yee,Also did not want to cancel 3 hours after accepting an invitation,65,12,18:58:40
Erica Yee,"So dim sum was really good, tried a different place than hei la moon cuz it was too crowded and it was good and cheap. At the end started feeling a headache. On bus back got text from someone on worship team inviting me to dinner with other band people at her house in Cambridge. At rehearsal I was feeling awkward and not really close to people so I felt like I should take this opportunity to get to know them more when God drops one in my lap",445,89,18:57:45
Erica Yee,Ooh can't wait to hear about it,31,7,18:55:04
Ben Fickes,Iâll tell you all about it later,34,7,18:34:28
Ben Fickes,Dnd was wild and we got wrecked haha,36,8,18:34:10

Erica Yee,How many levels?,16,3,12:26:13
Erica Yee,Oh nice!!,9,2,12:26:09
Ben Fickes,Thereâs more to do but I finally beat it as a character,57,12,12:19:25
Ben Fickes,I got through the full ending of enter the gungeon!,51,10,12:19:12
Ben Fickes,Of course :),12,3,11:43:22
Erica Yee,Thank you very much :),22,5,11:36:09

Ben Fickes,I will be! And sure thing,25,6,11:33:00
Erica Yee,Also are you gonna be home till 1?,34,8,11:16:38
Erica Yee,"Would you possibly be able to to swipe me in later, I might try to use the keyboard Dan's getting rn to practice",112,23,11:16:33
Erica Yee,Very rested,11,2,11:15:32
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today,23,5,11:11:02
Erica Yee,And omgggg yikes,16,3,10:43:49
Erica Yee,In this case,12,3,10:43:30
Erica Yee,I feel like I'm more of a slow walker,37,9,10:43:19
Ben Fickes,Then I had a different dream where all of Northeastern got mass emailed a riddle. I replied with an answer. Then they added everyone who replied to a Snapchat groupchat. Then before anyone said anything Mary started telling everyone how wrong their answers were,261,44,10:38:31
Ben Fickes,"We were at the conservatory we visited when I visited you, and your family was there too. But it was flooded and there were moving platforms and you and I were jumping between them and moving pretty fast while your family was just walking slowly when the platforms touched",272,49,10:37:15
Ben Fickes,I did dream about you last night but details are hazy,53,11,10:35:57
Ben Fickes,Itâs all good,15,3,10:35:46
Erica Yee,Oh dang I'm sorry,17,4,10:32:56
Ben Fickes,Oh actually had a terrible dream last night Iâll tell you,59,11,1:18:06
Erica Yee,ð sleep well and have interesting dreams to tell me no pressure,66,12,1:14:36
Ben Fickes,"Of course, thank you so much. For talking and letting me know :) I have said this before but I love you, all of who you are. Thank you for being in my life :)",158,35,1:10:59
Erica Yee,I think I've said this before but never thought I would enjoy spending one on one time just sitting on the couch together and talking so thanks :),146,28,1:09:32
Erica Yee,Indeed def going to sleep,25,5,1:08:32
Ben Fickes,Aw dang. Well you can always shower in the morning?,51,10,1:07:52
Erica Yee,Back but yikes someone showering lol,36,6,1:07:18

Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,22:10:12
Erica Yee,Coming!,7,1,22:07:07
Ben Fickes,"Donât know how to say this but if you text asking to come over later I may not notice because I am stopping hw to play enter the gungeon now haha. So yeah itâs okay to come and please call if I donât reply when you get here. Also if you donât want to come over for some reason thatâs completely okay too, donât wanna force",334,66,21:01:52
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,19:31:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing haha,20,4,19:30:06
Erica Yee,But is it ok if we talk about this later?,41,10,19:29:57
Erica Yee,"Also I forgot a ""but"" in the quote after ""place"" in case that's not clear",73,15,19:29:44
Erica Yee,Wait I don't understand your reasoning,38,6,19:29:22
Ben Fickes,But I am clearly not the most qualified to know what to do haha,63,14,19:20:07
Ben Fickes,"If qualifications and desire to work there are pretty even with the rest of the places, Iâd say go for regular if youâre applying to other internships or intern if youâre applying others regular",200,34,19:19:50
Ben Fickes,What do you think from the qualifications they ask for,54,10,19:19:06
Ben Fickes,Thatâs amazing! To both! But I can see how it would be a hard decision,72,15,19:18:41
Erica Yee,Which I appreciate but now idk what to do,41,9,19:18:10
Erica Yee,"But my summer supervisor was like ""Seattle times is a great place you're extremely qualified to go full time dev""",113,20,19:17:10
Erica Yee,In other news all the people I asked said yes to being references,65,13,19:15:26
Erica Yee,Sigh thanks,11,2,19:15:06
Ben Fickes,Know it doesnât bother you but geez,37,7,19:13:36
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry,16,3,19:13:03
Ben Fickes,What the heck,13,3,19:12:41
Erica Yee,Like .....yes of course I am but why you gotta say that,55,12,19:12:34
Erica Yee,"And then as I leave again she mutters ""wow aren't you glad I answered the door""",79,16,19:12:18
Erica Yee,"And I went in, grabbed my phone and said thank you",50,11,19:11:29
Erica Yee,Before class I forgot my phone right after I left so I knocked on my door and Mary answered,91,19,19:11:19
Ben Fickes,Np :),5,2,17:49:09
Erica Yee,and thanks :),13,3,16:38:51
Erica Yee,ooh ok,6,2,16:38:44
Ben Fickes,Run was good. Very cold haha,28,6,16:37:24
Ben Fickes,"And nothing wrong with that, you put in effort to it and got it done",68,15,16:37:18
Ben Fickes,Mattâs played the Harry Potter game (I forgot about that) and would play with us if we want. No pressure though,113,21,16:37:06
Erica Yee,how was your run,16,4,16:36:57

Erica Yee,lmao thanks,11,2,15:39:12
Ben Fickes,Seriously hope it goes well,27,5,15:34:43
Ben Fickes,It is now that youâre applying ;),35,7,15:34:36
Erica Yee,it's one of the most competitive news graphics internships,58,9,15:26:03
Erica Yee,just for application,20,3,15:25:41
Ben Fickes,Or just for the application,27,5,15:24:53
Ben Fickes,Wait did you get an interview?,30,6,15:24:44
Erica Yee,current one i need it for is seattle times,42,9,15:21:48
Erica Yee,oh yeah def for globe but that's not anything formal yet,56,11,15:21:30
Ben Fickes,Hmmm interesting. For Boston globe seems worth it if he knows people. Otherwise idk,83,14,15:19:41
Erica Yee,"wondering if matt carroll is good enough cuz he's offered, but i never actually had him as a professor",102,19,15:11:14
Erica Yee,thanks,6,1,15:10:44
Ben Fickes,oh dang hope it goes well,25,6,15:08:32
Erica Yee,i'm psyching myself up to send reference requests,49,8,15:08:10
Ben Fickes,no worries haha,15,3,15:07:05
Ben Fickes,idk actually,12,2,15:07:02
Erica Yee,ok closing tab lol sorry,24,5,15:06:59
Erica Yee,what was vanessa,16,3,15:06:56
Ben Fickes,oh eh probably not rn,21,5,15:06:55
Erica Yee,since idk if we're doing a whole campaign,41,8,15:06:46
Erica Yee,oh i meant is looking at subclasses worth,41,8,15:06:38
Ben Fickes,But will start out much more simplified,39,7,15:06:32
Ben Fickes,So yeah rogue is still worth it,31,7,15:06:25
Ben Fickes,generally all classes get subclasses at level 3,47,8,15:06:19
Erica Yee,is it worth then,16,4,15:06:01
Erica Yee,oh,2,1,15:05:59
Ben Fickes,so actually you don't have to worry about it yet,48,10,15:05:59
Ben Fickes,and we're starting at level 2,29,6,15:05:51
Ben Fickes,oh you don't gain that until level 3,36,8,15:05:46
Ben Fickes,"They're the names under ""Rogueish Archetype""",44,6,15:00:34
Ben Fickes,http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/rogue,30,1,15:00:19
Ben Fickes,If you want we can also go through them together,48,10,14:59:45
Ben Fickes,Sure,4,1,14:59:36
Erica Yee,please,6,1,14:59:11
Erica Yee,can you send me the list of subclasses and i'll choose one,58,12,14:59:10
Ben Fickes,You can dodge things other people can't,39,7,14:58:49
Ben Fickes,You have evasion eventually which is really good,48,8,14:58:39
Ben Fickes,"I have been haha, it partly depends on your subclass",52,10,14:58:23
Erica Yee,well keep reading dude,22,4,14:52:23
Ben Fickes,rogue is really powerful. Don't actually know all it can do but Vanessa's character was really powerful with it,111,19,14:52:04
Erica Yee,oh yeah lemme get the epic games,32,7,14:48:34
Erica Yee,"nice, that's definitely what i'm more used to based on games i've playe",71,13,14:48:29
Ben Fickes,"skills let you strategize too, and you definitely have those",60,10,14:47:52
Ben Fickes,yeah it is definitely an added layer of complexity,50,9,14:47:31
Erica Yee,didn't know not having them was an option,41,8,14:46:23
Erica Yee,spells seem too complicated to remember and strategize,54,8,14:46:15
Erica Yee,i made a good choice,20,5,14:46:05
Erica Yee,oh really?!,11,2,14:45:59
Ben Fickes,rogues don't have spells either haha,36,6,14:45:45
Erica Yee,spells seems so integral,24,4,14:42:47
Erica Yee,:O,2,1,14:42:38
Ben Fickes,And no spells,13,3,14:36:23
Ben Fickes,Yep! Monks usually use hand to hand combat I think,50,10,14:36:21
Erica Yee,unless i made that up,21,5,14:36:04
Erica Yee,that's different from cleric?,29,4,14:36:00
Ben Fickes,nothing set in stone yet though,31,6,14:34:20
Ben Fickes,I asked him about it during our break,37,8,14:34:14
Ben Fickes,Jason might be a Monk for dnd,29,7,14:34:07
Ben Fickes,would not have guessed that haha,32,6,14:33:59
Ben Fickes,interesting,11,1,14:33:54
Erica Yee,also she said hand-tossed is they put garlic butter on the crust,64,12,14:30:02

Erica Yee,Aw I'm sorry ð are you gonna ask?,36,8,13:56:26
Ben Fickes,Sorry just needed to rant,25,5,13:53:27
Ben Fickes,Got a 25/35 on the hw though. And each hw is 2%. It was for omitting something I'm convinced the instructions never asked for. Jason also left it out and got 33/35,163,32,13:53:20
Ben Fickes,"Got my networks exam back, 86",29,6,13:52:30

Erica Yee,Whoa facilities got it?,23,4,11:39:26
Erica Yee,Well assuming they are building a legit team with other more experienced people I would be down. I realized at the chronicle that it's much more meaningful to me to work at a region I care and know about,203,39,11:39:20
Ben Fickes,They got it though,18,4,11:37:40
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but there was a mouse in our apartment,53,10,11:37:36
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Do you think youâd consider them or not then,55,11,11:18:13

Ben Fickes,"Haha the dream is amazing, thanks for sharing. And oh my goodness thatâs amazing Erica! Dang thatâs so impressive theyâre recruiting you haha (as they should be ð)",172,28,10:04:25
Erica Yee,Omg what,8,2,9:55:03
Erica Yee,I don't even want to try to interpret this lol,46,10,9:53:33
Erica Yee,"We + a few other people were being chased across Boston for our lives, but it didn't look like any Boston I know. There were tunnels, buses underground, historic mansions, a man in a gigantic dinosaur suit.

Erica Yee,Verrryyy weird dream,20,3,9:50:10
Ben Fickes,You sent it to me I think. And haha wow dang that sounds rushed and not that enjoyable haha. But glad it was good,113,24,0:41:00
Erica Yee,Also did I send you the hunt news design snap or did I accidentally send it to someone else lol,95,20,0:23:48
Erica Yee,But she said it was good,24,6,0:01:16
Erica Yee,Omg Danielle's trip to Houston was literally three 30-min interviews and 2 of the interviewers were remote,106,17,0:01:11
Ben Fickes,HAHA wow nice,13,3,22:58:16
Erica Yee,(not as a student I presume ð),33,7,22:56:24

Ben Fickes,Dang. And thanks haha,21,4,17:56:04

Erica Yee,Former,6,1,17:42:37
Ben Fickes,I know haha. And yikes. Criticize like the eating on your phone (âitâs bad for youâ) or like criticizing me (âstop thatâ),131,22,17:41:02
Erica Yee,"Yikes Mary criticized me again, this time about using the computer in the dark (my desk lamp is on..)",101,19,17:29:51
Erica Yee,That's what I'm trying to tell him,34,7,17:29:24
Ben Fickes,Well I can relate but also yâknow God and community,53,10,17:15:57

Ben Fickes,Crumby,6,1,14:18:02
Ben Fickes,Oh wait I meant crummy,22,5,14:17:56
Ben Fickes,"Or, as they say... crusty",25,5,14:17:45
Ben Fickes,I'm sorry but that was terrible,31,6,14:17:36
Erica Yee,Sandwichulous,13,1,14:16:33

Erica Yee,Don't think I've had a wollies sandwich this semester yet,57,10,14:15:00
Erica Yee,Well you at least,17,4,14:14:53
Erica Yee,"Professors, they're just like us",32,5,14:14:47

Ben Fickes,Am looking forward to it haha,29,6,14:14:18
Erica Yee,Went to go see capstone professor and got stuck awkwardly standing next to him while he was talking with other professors (including my ood one). Will tell you about it haha,173,31,14:12:10

Ben Fickes,I could get one for you and bring it to IV?,43,11,12:08:45
Ben Fickes,And eat mine before,19,4,12:08:36
Ben Fickes,Hmmm or I could go at like 4 when thereâs probably not a crowd,64,14,12:08:32
Ben Fickes,"You took probably the only pun on the word Popeyes, congrats",60,11,12:08:17
Erica Yee,wow that made me physically cringe,34,6,12:04:40
Erica Yee,what an eyepopping coincidence,30,4,12:04:33
Ben Fickes,Cuz Iâm meeting with soft Dev group before,44,8,12:04:27
Ben Fickes,Wait I was thinking the same thing,34,7,12:04:17

Erica Yee,"(""thought"")",11,1,11:22:18
Erica Yee,i'm all thawed out,18,4,11:21:37
Ben Fickes,"(Get it, ""repeated"")",20,3,11:18:41
Ben Fickes,At least we haven't reheated any puns yet,41,8,11:18:36
Ben Fickes,The time's up,13,3,11:18:09
Ben Fickes,is that another pun,19,4,11:18:06
Erica Yee,(but yeah same hitting my limit and think my time's up),55,11,11:16:04
Erica Yee,Maybe they'll soften if you put them back in,44,9,11:15:38
Ben Fickes,(okay these are seriously really hard to think of),50,9,11:14:29
Ben Fickes,sorry that my humor isn't instant,33,6,11:14:12
Erica Yee,Then you need to try harder to rotate in new ones,49,11,11:11:19
Ben Fickes,it's hard for me to think of any puns that are leftover,55,12,11:05:40
Erica Yee,maybe i'll warm to it later,27,6,11:03:17
Ben Fickes,Guess we're not on the same wavelength,38,7,11:02:14
Erica Yee,i don't know watt you're talking about,38,7,11:00:33
Ben Fickes,You're radiating hilarity,25,3,10:59:03
Erica Yee,Yeah it was a power move,24,6,10:52:40
Ben Fickes,Because microwaves have clocks,30,4,10:46:51
Ben Fickes,Was that a pun,14,4,10:46:45
Erica Yee,Next time,9,2,10:45:40
Ben Fickes,That's because you didn't push my buttons,41,7,10:44:31
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,10:42:17
Erica Yee,I'm glad it didn't turn into a heated debate,44,9,10:42:14
Ben Fickes,"Oh remind me to tell you about convo with Jason last night, I told him about my inability to say ""cute""",103,21,10:37:31
Ben Fickes,You make a strong case for microwaving it that long,51,10,10:36:47
Erica Yee,Actually on the higher side is ok cuz you have the case,55,12,10:35:36
Erica Yee,Yeah probably 1min-1min30,25,3,10:35:09
Erica Yee,Aw sorry to hear that,21,5,10:34:57
Ben Fickes,Do I just microwave the heat pack,33,7,10:34:35

Erica Yee,How's your leg,14,3,10:33:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah basically. And wow you do have good music memory,53,10,9:14:05
Erica Yee,"Also fun fact the chord on when they sing ""bones"" is one of my favorites haha (I/III)",85,17,7:54:08
Erica Yee,"Coincidentally, the time I heard it that made me decide to put it in my library was in the locker room at Marino (like through the gym speakers haha)",149,29,7:46:57
Erica Yee,Parable of the wise and foolish builders in a way haha,54,11,7:45:32
Ben Fickes,"Listened to The Bones and actually liked it a lot - I like the lyrics and (per usual) have ""alternate meanings"" in my head to make it somewhat about God haha. I'll tell you my thoughts in person",194,38,0:13:20
Ben Fickes,Thank you present Erica,23,4,23:22:00

Erica Yee,Went to curry to see if I had any chance of getting a sandwich and the like is all the way to burger so nope haha,113,26,17:16:16
Erica Yee,Wow I read too much,19,5,15:10:32
Erica Yee,"Yah the vast majority of romance books are as follows: get to know each other -> eventually get together in some form labeled or unlabeled -> things go great and they are happy with each other -> sudden conflict threatens to tear them apart (depending on genre/storyline could be anything from a bad argument to an ex coming back to someone getting kidnapped) -> somehow the conflict gets resolved and they get back together ""for good""",435,76,15:10:18
Ben Fickes,And nice haha,13,3,15:04:10
Ben Fickes,So they like breakup but then end up together? Glad you liked it haha,69,14,15:04:07
Erica Yee,Omg just saw Kenny in the library but don't think he saw me,59,13,14:41:55
Erica Yee,So many books have fake sounding breakup scenes/chapters that feel out of nowhere like the author just needed to throw in a conflict at the end so that it could be resolved. But this one used the character challenges and development the whole book built really well,265,47,14:39:13
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I finished well met (Ren faire book) over lunch beside the epilogue and the breakup was ðð,104,19,14:37:28
Erica Yee,Nah I don't try to initiate conversation with her haha,54,10,14:31:04
Ben Fickes,Thought this was you talking to Mary at first (idk why) but realized it was not haha,84,17,14:27:49
Erica Yee,"Me trying to make conversation: did you do anything for Halloween?
Classmate: no because I don't drink
Me: oh ok
Her: but my roommates do
Me: oh
Her: for three days straight
Me: oh wow
Her: but it was ... fun
Me: *slight laughter*",230,44,14:25:11
Erica Yee,Not as part of the class,24,6,14:22:51
Ben Fickes,Nice! Are you gonna print anything do you think,47,9,14:19:41
Erica Yee,Class let our super early because we just visited the 3d printing studio,72,13,14:18:35

Erica Yee,8ish,4,1,12:52:56
Erica Yee,"Now I'm rethinking sabbath lol. Cuz it's sorta ""work"" to serve, but Also I have to do two services so that's gonna cut out so much of Sunday",140,28,12:52:54
Ben Fickes,Wait when does your practice end,32,6,12:52:44

Ben Fickes,^im pretty proud of thinking of that even though itâs really cheesy,69,12,11:45:58
Ben Fickes,You werenât in my dream because every second with you in real life is a dream come true,89,18,11:45:36
Ben Fickes,Yeah I know itâs a letdown from yours haha,44,9,11:45:03
Ben Fickes,In the dream I was at my middle school and starting a new semester. I sat down for class and a new group project was announced. Kenny and Melina were suddenly next to me and asked if we could form a group and I started stressing about how to tell them no,254,52,11:44:54
Erica Yee,wow i tell you i dream about you and this is what you dream about,65,15,11:44:17
Ben Fickes,Okay I had a very short dream (much less interesting) that I didnât want to share in class because Kenny is in it and I remembered his friend is in my class,158,32,11:43:51
Erica Yee,thanks,6,1,11:35:22
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope it feels better later,34,6,11:27:11

Erica Yee,And then I woke up way before my alarm lol,42,10,10:35:25
Erica Yee,"We were at this Korean restaurant/bar that i don't think actually exists and I was your plus one though I don't know what the occasion was. You had this fan club of girls who were really protective of you (no one I know in real life) and kept grilling me. One of them asked ""how serious are you about Ben"" and I was like ""pretty"" (not even ""pretty serious"" lol idk why I phrased it like that) and they were so scandalized they started spreading the news around the room that you were finally getting serious with someone (lol??). Then we all went up to get drinks that the event organizer was paying for and I went to show my driver's license but the only IDs I had in my phone pocket were Vanessa and Olivia's old school IDs HAHA. So I couldn't get a drink. And then suddenly we were back in campus but the dorms looked super different. You were getting really into my mini Nerf basketball game and I was giving facilities advice on how to redo the ceilings (what)",965,183,10:35:11
Erica Yee,Was typing but then Sophie came in and she had a weird dream too so we were telling each other haha,99,21,10:28:10
Ben Fickes,Ooh I would love to hear about it!,34,8,10:16:19
Erica Yee,Idk if it'll make sense if I type it out,40,10,10:15:56

Erica Yee,"Just finished talking to family, need to eat dinner",51,9,20:47:31
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,13:57:41
Erica Yee,Will be down soon,17,4,13:57:38
Erica Yee,Oh ok yeah,10,3,13:57:33
Ben Fickes,I can meet you by Willis if you want,36,9,13:50:21
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm not doing gungeon so Iâm heading over now,54,10,13:50:13
Erica Yee,I know very surprising,22,4,13:48:34
Ben Fickes,Iâm shocked,13,2,13:45:42
Erica Yee,He's a mess lol,15,4,13:43:22
Ben Fickes,How was it/how is he,20,5,13:41:48
Ben Fickes,Sure thing,10,2,13:41:43
Erica Yee,Victor's at my apt so might come along,38,8,13:39:28
Erica Yee,Sounds good,11,2,13:39:20
Ben Fickes,Okay I just finished lunch with Michael. Still have to clean and might finish a gungeon run Iâm partway through haha but then Iâm gonna go to Ryder,151,28,13:34:21
Erica Yee,Definitely haha,15,2,11:13:23
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I remember that one. And gotcha, I guess I can see how the ren fair could be lighter",89,19,11:09:48
Erica Yee,"Like the book I read a few books ago (""evvie Drake starts over"") about the women whose husband dies in a car accident the day she is going to leave him + guy who was a star Yankees pitcher who gets the yips --> that book had a much more serious, emotional turmoil-y tone. This one is very playful",296,59,11:05:56
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,11:03:25
Ben Fickes,Hmmm I see. Is it all her perspective?,38,8,11:01:15
Erica Yee,All in first person so it's her finding out about why he's like this,68,14,10:59:55
Erica Yee,Hm it does when I write it out this way by the book is actually a good balance of overall light tone that still respects serious stuff,134,27,10:59:32
Ben Fickes,If you ever feel like I criticize you too much and youâd rather me adopt the personality of one of my dnd characters Iâd be happy to. (Actually I wouldnât be happy to haha),178,34,10:51:54
Ben Fickes,Wow sounds like the author went heavy on the trauma in the backstories,70,13,10:51:20
Erica Yee,Oops that was a lot haha,24,6,10:49:59
Erica Yee,--> conflicting feelings,24,3,10:49:53
Erica Yee,"Her niece really wants to participate in the town's Ren faire, which is modeled after the biggest one in Maryland (is that true?). She gets roped into volunteering as a tavern wench. The English teacher runs the whole thing because it was started by his brother who died a few years ago of cancer so he feels very strongly about everything going well. He always criticizes her for not being serious enough, but when he's in costume as a pirate he gets very into character and acts completely different toward her",512,91,10:49:48
Erica Yee,The protagonist is this girl who goes from Boston to small town in Maryland to take care of her single mom sister and niece after they were in a car accident. She was an English major but dropped out to support her college boyfriend so he could focus solely on law school. Once he got a job at a law firm he broke up with her and so she's feeling lost and lacking,363,73,10:47:36
Erica Yee,The English teacher is the love interest,40,7,10:44:56
Ben Fickes,And whoâs the other love interest,35,6,10:44:23
Ben Fickes,The English teacher is the gym teacher or the love interest,59,11,10:44:12
Erica Yee,They flirt over Shakespeare conspiracy theories,47,6,10:44:10
Erica Yee,(((it's the upright English teacher of course))),48,7,10:43:51
Ben Fickes,Thanks for clarifying haha. For both things haha,48,8,10:43:49
Erica Yee,((also he's not the love interest lol)),39,7,10:43:41
Erica Yee,(in the book),13,3,10:43:29
Erica Yee,No but there's a hot gym teacher who wears a kilt haha,54,12,10:43:24
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad haha. And wow haha sorry you didnât meet your knight in shining armor in 7th grade haha,100,19,10:30:04
Erica Yee,I started this new book last night and it's a romance that plays out in a Renaissance faire. I'm increasingly feeling gypped by my 7th grade experience lol,155,28,10:28:20
Erica Yee,Listening to me complain helps xD,33,6,10:27:17
Erica Yee,"Thanks but it's ok, I think it's mostly bruises lol",51,10,10:26:44
Ben Fickes,But otherwise idk how to help haha,34,7,10:25:19
Ben Fickes,I can give you a shoulder or back rub if that helps at all,58,14,10:25:10

Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,23:27:44
Ben Fickes,If that makes sense haha,24,5,23:25:36
Ben Fickes,"Most of the day. Michael asked if I wanted to get lunch at 1, so either after that or before and after",102,22,23:24:59
Erica Yee,Roughly,7,1,23:24:34
Erica Yee,Ooh when do you think you're gonna be therw,43,9,23:24:27
Ben Fickes,Think Iâm gonna make a FB post about working in Ryder tomorrow to see if anyone comes,87,17,23:22:22
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,23:15:02
Ben Fickes,"Sorry didnât get a notification. We should have two (one after this second day) but they may have not counted one meaning three, two after this",145,26,23:10:03
Erica Yee,You can chain late days? How many do you have left?,51,11,22:34:57
Erica Yee,Aww,3,1,22:34:49
Ben Fickes,Ugh we messed up soft dev yesterday and I figured it out today as I was working. So I fixed it but weâd have to take a second late day if we want the change to be in,167,38,22:24:10
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure itâs not that bad haha,35,7,22:23:36
Erica Yee,The mat burn on my elbow is so gross lol,40,10,22:09:29
Erica Yee,Thanks you too,14,3,22:09:02
Ben Fickes,"Okeydokey, hope you sleep well :)",33,6,22:08:42
Erica Yee,Honestly not gonna stay up that late cuz I'm exhausted so think I'll stay in,76,15,22:08:21
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna hang out at all tonight or would you rather just stay in,69,15,22:05:32
Erica Yee,Matt lol but ð,17,4,21:59:49
Ben Fickes,"Idk if youâre talking about Taylor or Matt, Matt is doing a sunrise hike and Taylor is over because she Jason and Rachel all bailed on a Halloween party",154,29,21:58:51
Erica Yee,For what?!,10,2,21:48:59
Ben Fickes,And Matt went to bed already because he has to wake up at 2:30 haha,67,15,21:35:48

Ben Fickes,"Nice haha, glad heâs willing to help",38,7,21:17:11
Erica Yee,Thanks haha. The toughest guy was actually the smallest by size I fought I think but he's super nice and would stop in the middle give me pointers and let me practice them lol,175,34,21:06:17
Ben Fickes,No problem haha thanks for sharing. I can appreciate from sparring the feeling so way to go on how well you did :),114,23,21:00:48
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening haha,25,4,21:00:15
Erica Yee,So I am very bruised but ok,27,7,20:59:50
Erica Yee,"And the last guy I rolled with was the tallest and most muscular guy in the class...he clearly wasn't trying at all and I couldn't reach his head/arms anyway. But I still kept trying to get out of leg grip and finally he had to try to flip me because I was being so annoying and he couldn't haha. At the end it was basically a tie and I said good job. He said it back and then was like ""actually good job, I was trying really hard to flip you"" haha",448,92,20:59:20
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Way to go!,21,5,20:58:12
Erica Yee,"At the end we did live fighting, switching partners every 5 mins or so. Only 7 or 8 people came today and vivian and I were the only girls so I had to roll with some guys. One of them clearly did not want to roll with girls. I could tell he wasn't trying very hard at all at first but then I kinda forced him to and actually ended up on top by the end!! So he had to do the crunches lol",386,84,20:56:03
Ben Fickes,Dang are you feeling okay now? And thatâs hilarious thanks for sharing haha,77,13,20:54:07
Erica Yee,I had 4 slices of pizza 3 hours before class but wasn't enough time to fully digest still I guess lol because I felt it the whole time. Actually threw up in my mouth a little but was fine,187,39,20:49:02
Erica Yee,"Ok so first, a quote for the ages from our coach katana

Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,10:57:02
Ben Fickes,Got an A and A- on the first two papers so I feel like I have a little buffer if this one isn't as strong. But I have enough time I can probably do more research,161,36,10:53:09

Erica Yee,oh yay glad you liked it,24,6,16:24:17
Ben Fickes,Kenny said Pivotal has a hiring freeze because it got acquired ð¬ð¥¶,71,12,16:20:10
Ben Fickes,We finished soft dev in like an hour haha,41,9,16:19:32
Ben Fickes,"I listened to it during soft dev work. Have definitely not heard it before, I really liked it!",94,18,16:19:24
Ben Fickes,no worries! I'll check it out later,35,7,15:16:44
Erica Yee,Yes sorry sent on my phone (so messenger lite),46,9,15:15:50
Ben Fickes,"Didn't show preview, is this the jimmy needham song",51,9,15:13:46
Erica Yee,"If you want to listen to it, know you have soft dev now",55,13,15:13:11
Erica Yee,https://youtu.be/R9LFiQPFgiY,28,1,15:12:53
Erica Yee,But thanks for always having my back,36,7,15:11:08
Erica Yee,(I literally just groaned out loud),35,6,15:11:01
Ben Fickes,That's what I'm ear for,23,5,15:09:06
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening :),23,4,15:08:24
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing your thoughts,32,5,15:03:11
Erica Yee,Ohh yeah makes sense. I do give other money (less systematically) to other things but I always thought of tithing as to church. I def see your point tho,152,29,14:59:53
Ben Fickes,I have never thought about this until now haha,46,9,14:56:20
Ben Fickes,"No problem haha. I actually have always thought of tithing as giving money to ""God's work,"" so I haven't given all my co op tithe money to church (I gave some to places like the afterschool program I volunteer with). But in the Bible I guess the example is tithing to the Levites so I guess that does line up more with specifically giving it to church",351,67,14:56:11
Erica Yee,(feel free to share thoughts tho),33,6,14:54:43
Erica Yee,Ok now that I talked about it I feel better about giving it all to the church. Gonna pray about it more but thanks for being my journal lol,139,29,14:54:32
Erica Yee,"And I know that's not the point of tithing. But I feel like I could give it elsewhere that's more ""needy."" But but we are called to tithe to our churches in faith. It's not like I know what they actually need or what it could be used for",237,49,14:52:47
Erica Yee,I'm finally getting around to tithing my co-op money (ik so late and also I'm finding any reason to procrastinate capstone). But I feel kinda hesitant about giving it all to aletheia because I'm pretty sure the church is doing ok financially,241,42,14:51:17
Erica Yee,I have a question,17,4,14:49:26
Erica Yee,Though you would write better than most I'm sure,48,9,14:49:14
Erica Yee,Please don't lol,16,3,14:49:04
Ben Fickes,Wow I should write for them,27,6,14:46:07
Erica Yee,Lol ok,6,2,14:43:22
Erica Yee,"Actually the directions for nu sci articles say ""headlines with puns are highly encouraged""",91,14,14:43:16
Ben Fickes,"Dan would be ""kinda down"" for the escape room but doesn't know if he's free haha",80,16,14:41:58
Ben Fickes,I really am infecting you aren't I,34,7,14:38:53
Erica Yee,While we were doing bringing puns to a gunfight I realized I could think of some for my article lol,99,20,14:37:32
Ben Fickes,We just got on break so I saw haha,34,9,14:36:33
Ben Fickes,But now I'm also curious,24,5,14:35:48
Ben Fickes,And I'm already proud,21,4,14:35:44
Ben Fickes,It will probably be a great deal of joy,39,9,14:35:39
Erica Yee,And make you proud of me,24,6,14:35:25
Erica Yee,Hopefully my snaps will bring you a miniscule bit of joy,56,11,14:35:15
Ben Fickes,Mainly networks,15,2,14:32:38
Ben Fickes,I'm already crying over soft dev and networks,45,8,14:32:33
Erica Yee,Now time to cry over capstone,29,6,14:31:15
Ben Fickes,Way to go :),12,4,14:30:15
Erica Yee,And submitted! One day early haha,33,6,14:28:43

Erica Yee,"Oh no root was last issue, this one is heat haha",48,11,14:17:49
Ben Fickes,Yay glad you could get it done!,31,7,14:17:21
Ben Fickes,"Ah ""root""",9,2,14:17:02
Erica Yee,I made the good decision to give up on the infographic and banged out an article,80,16,14:16:52
Erica Yee,You can when it's published in nu sci haha,42,9,14:16:27
Ben Fickes,Dang thank you for sharing! What's the writing for? Could I look at it?,71,14,14:11:14
Erica Yee,That's all haha,15,3,14:10:38
Erica Yee,Ok I really like it. The rap is so good. Anyway it shuffled on cuz I'm listening to my Christian playlist right when I'm writing about how trees and other vegetation keep us cool (it's so much cooler than how I'm summarizing it). And I just really felt an amazing sense of wonder for God's creation,298,56,14:10:36
Erica Yee,Dunno yet,9,2,14:09:00
Ben Fickes,I might've from John but not entirely sure,42,8,14:08:11
Ben Fickes,Haha which will you choose,26,5,14:08:02
Erica Yee,Have you heard the how great thou art remix with Jimmy Needham feat. Trip Lee?,78,15,14:07:36
Erica Yee,The try hard way is to do a reported piece. The easier way is to an analysis essay. Hmm lol,91,20,14:07:18
Erica Yee,I just found out today we have a final project for ethics..,59,12,14:07:00
Ben Fickes,We'll have thanksgiving and then hopefully things will be more chill here,73,12,14:06:15
Ben Fickes,Dude I'm so excited for like a month from now,45,10,14:06:05
Ben Fickes,Yay indeed haha,15,3,14:05:54
Erica Yee,Oh so we will have each other yay haha,38,9,14:05:28
Ben Fickes,I think that might be my only one?,34,8,14:03:12
Ben Fickes,I have Networks 12/11,21,4,14:03:06
Erica Yee,Ian is ok with 10th and Kenny didn't respond so maybe it'll be then,67,14,14:01:34
Erica Yee,"Oh wait apparently ""Erica previously said she can only do the 10th"" according to the professor",94,16,14:01:12

Ben Fickes,Haha ð good call,19,4,13:32:14
Erica Yee,Maybe you should apply for whatever studio made this game. You can put on your resume that Sega heroes used one of your puns,124,24,13:31:57
Erica Yee,I'll probably be still be off target,36,7,13:31:21
Ben Fickes,Hmm maybe the next round will be better,39,8,13:29:24
Erica Yee,Wow that was pretty bad. But I bit the bullet,45,10,13:29:04
Erica Yee,"It's ok, I'm not as-salt-y",26,5,13:28:40
Ben Fickes,Well you gave it your best shot,31,7,13:26:34
Erica Yee,Oh no I'm rubbing off on you. Maybe try reloading?,50,10,13:26:32
Ben Fickes,I played that today and did so badly,36,8,13:26:16
Erica Yee,Hmm I'm blanking on it now,26,6,13:26:12
Ben Fickes,Realization whoops,18,2,13:26:03
Ben Fickes,Haha ð what âtriggerâed the memory,41,6,13:25:50
Erica Yee,Oh wow I just realized it's a pun,33,8,13:22:19
Erica Yee,Like enter the gungeon,22,4,13:22:13
Erica Yee,It's ok I just can't help much lol,34,8,13:22:06
Ben Fickes,Oh dang Iâm so sorry. Looks like class 2 was a bad call then haha,67,15,13:20:57
Erica Yee,Well I think you can start asking people first,46,9,13:20:54
Erica Yee,The boss is so hard for me. All my characters died one round,60,13,13:20:40
Erica Yee,Me too,6,2,13:20:28
Ben Fickes,I did the Halloween event for SEGA heroes but itâs kinda bad haha,67,13,13:19:45
Ben Fickes,Kenny hasnât replied to anything,34,5,13:19:00
Ben Fickes,I also have done nothing outside of class time,46,9,13:18:48
Ben Fickes,Or fewer?,9,2,13:18:38
Ben Fickes,Should I buy ten tickets then?,30,6,13:18:33

Erica Yee,Forgot b was going to Connecticut,33,6,12:44:59
Erica Yee,Kristy Sophie Barbara are all no lol,36,7,12:44:54
Erica Yee,Yeah don't think I have anything planned,40,7,12:33:33
Ben Fickes,Jason canât do 3 and says 7 might be good so we can get dinner before or after. Does that work for you?,105,23,12:17:30
Ben Fickes,Sorry the 8:20 and 7:00 are out of order haha,45,10,12:13:36
Ben Fickes,"3:00, 4:20, 8:20, or 7:00 on Sunday",35,7,12:13:24
Ben Fickes,Because figuring it out with ten people is gonna be real hard,61,12,11:57:01
Ben Fickes,Lemme pick out a room and time,30,7,11:56:51
Ben Fickes,Okay haha,9,2,11:56:45
Erica Yee,Ok yeah I can start with my roommates and we can keep a tally lol,65,15,11:56:36
Erica Yee,More like your thoughts haha,28,5,11:56:20
Ben Fickes,If for some reason he says yes and literally everyone else does I can sit out I guess. But thatâs unlikely,108,21,11:56:10
Ben Fickes,Iâll ask Thiago so heâs not left out but Iâm expecting a no,65,13,11:55:49
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna ask barbs and Iâll ask everyone else,51,10,11:55:39
Ben Fickes,Your thoughts shape reality,27,4,11:55:26
Erica Yee,Wow I'm listening to a podcast that's an improv musical and they just started singing about an escape room,106,19,11:54:58
Erica Yee,"Kristy might be working. Off the top of my head could also ask at Katie, Vivian, Justin",87,17,11:54:30
Erica Yee,Oh I definitely want to ask Rachel And amy,42,9,11:53:01
Ben Fickes,Iâm also assuming some people will be unable to make it,57,11,11:52:46
Ben Fickes,Or to invite Mike or Roger,26,6,11:52:38
Ben Fickes,We could also take out Rachel and Amy if you want to invite more people,71,15,11:52:25
Ben Fickes,"But we could (possibly) have:
You
Me
Jason
Rachel
Dan
Matt
Amy
John
Shem
Barbs (would she do it?)",97,19,11:50:55
Ben Fickes,Okay so I think Thiago is doing husky hunt,42,9,11:49:58
Ben Fickes,Ohhhh thatâs right,20,3,11:49:47
Erica Yee,A lot of my friends I would ask are doing husky hunt so probs won't do it but I can ask around,94,22,11:49:33
Erica Yee,Ooh got it,10,3,11:40:05
Ben Fickes,Oh sorry I didnât communicate that at all. Thereâs a place called escape the room Boston that Iâve done before,116,20,11:30:19
Erica Yee,You have one in mind?,21,5,11:29:09
Ben Fickes,Looks like up to 10 people! We can do a lot of people then,58,14,11:24:54
Ben Fickes,"On my end Iâm thinking I could do my roomies, or John shem and Thiago, or Roger and/or mike or something",106,21,11:23:00
Ben Fickes,Okay lemme check how many people we can have,44,9,11:22:06
Erica Yee,"Sure, dk if there will be a better time",39,9,11:19:08
Ben Fickes,It is haha. Lemme know your thoughts but we should try to find people if you want to do it,90,20,11:14:00
Erica Yee,Lol is random,13,3,10:38:52
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,10:38:40
Ben Fickes,Completely unrelated but on Sunday would you wanna try to get people for an escape room?,88,16,9:48:16
Ben Fickes,Iâm supposed to meet with Kenny but he hasnât responded yet. And this is Melina who needs help,98,18,9:47:56
Erica Yee,And ooh ok weren't you meeting up anyway sometime today?,56,10,9:39:44
Erica Yee,Whoops lol,10,2,9:39:17
Erica Yee,Oh crap totally forgot till you just mentioned it,49,9,9:38:55
Ben Fickes,Did you talk about physical boundary stuff? No worries if you didnât. And turns out I do because it was optional group work so I thought they wouldnât be going but one group member needs help so Iâm going to help them,223,42,9:34:57

Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬,8,1,15:10:56
Ben Fickes,Heâd just straight up be a grandpa at like 38,47,10,15:02:16
Ben Fickes,Heâd be a GREAT-Grandfather then if they also continue the trend...,69,11,15:02:01
Ben Fickes,No I did that wrong,19,5,15:01:38
Ben Fickes,"Dang if his kids have (or really, had) kids when he had kids heâll be a grandfather at 56...",94,19,15:01:23
Ben Fickes,I mean thatâs not really a spoiler haha,41,8,15:00:32
Erica Yee,Ok I'm spoiling the story,25,5,14:57:15
Erica Yee,YES,3,1,14:57:05

Erica Yee,Sorry was telling the story to sophie. I'll tell you the full thing in person but we were discussing Twitter bots in English class and the professor talked about the ones he made. So I decided to look at his Twitter account and there was a link to a personal blog post he wrote in August about his oldest kid going off to college,329,64,14:53:12
Ben Fickes,About what?,11,2,14:44:27

Ben Fickes,You sure? I donât think it should be on you to fix it...,58,13,13:29:13

Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm so sorry. But being able to install packages is something? And dang Iâm sorry that stinks...,105,18,22:49:59
Erica Yee,Plus the person in my design group said she can't upload the thing I need to do my part until tomorrow afternoon?!?!,116,22,22:49:25
Erica Yee,So basically wasted hours on nu sci instead of hw and have nothing to show for it still (it's due Wednesday),108,21,22:49:03

Erica Yee,I want to see how it ends though and how portray the web development process so gonna keep reading,98,19,20:17:10
Erica Yee,Teen bullies,12,2,20:17:03
Ben Fickes,Who are the bad guys,20,5,20:08:55
Erica Yee,"Uh oh bad guys are bragging about ""third world countries"" they went on missions trips too I don't like this",107,20,20:05:25
Erica Yee,The boy pulls out a giant wad of cash to pay for an expensive group dinner anonymously. Like what 18 year old will have that much CASH on them when if they're rich,163,33,20:04:53
Ben Fickes,What are they doing this time,29,6,20:03:00
Ben Fickes,Ugh how terrible,16,3,20:02:56

Ben Fickes,Okay haha,9,2,19:59:41
Ben Fickes,Iâve also heard enter the gungeon is good but idk what kind of game it is,75,16,19:59:36
Erica Yee,"Idr what it's called, but it's pretty obvious out of the 2 haha",63,13,19:59:34
Erica Yee,"Oh totally unrelated but remind me to tell you ""where are you from"" story (it was me asking..)",94,18,19:59:12
Ben Fickes,Which one?,10,2,19:59:00
Erica Yee,Based on my 1.2 seconds of looking at it,40,9,19:58:47
Erica Yee,One of the free epic games looks portal-esque,45,8,19:58:39
Ben Fickes,Maybe Iâll download a new one,31,6,19:57:19
Ben Fickes,Mattâs using the tv so probably pc or switch,46,9,19:57:04
Ben Fickes,Idk I played Celeste and my Kirby game this morning,51,10,19:56:31
Ben Fickes,Haha ð wow glad you donât have romance plots (plural) in real life,71,13,19:56:21
Erica Yee,Anyway what games were you thinking,35,6,19:55:06
Erica Yee,It was actually about books I've read/am reading,48,8,19:54:50
Erica Yee,But I realize you probably meant my story ideas so I stopped laughing,69,13,19:54:36
Erica Yee,Oh at first I thought you meant my own life and I started laughing,66,14,19:54:15
Ben Fickes,Your own or in general,22,5,19:53:35
Erica Yee,I'm talking to Barbara about romance plots,42,7,19:53:20
Ben Fickes,Thatâs hilarious haha,23,3,19:53:19
Ben Fickes,ððð,12,1,19:53:08
Erica Yee,Lol jk please don't idk why I said that,39,9,19:52:52
Erica Yee,Hard to get,11,3,19:52:45
Ben Fickes,No problem hah,14,3,19:52:38
Ben Fickes,Iâm debating what game to play now,36,7,19:52:34
Erica Yee,But thank you for catching and appreciating,43,7,19:52:27
Erica Yee,Wow that was not intentional,28,5,19:52:14
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, glad you had a good day and can hopefully have a chill night :)",71,15,19:50:00
Ben Fickes,âHot secâ haha,18,3,19:49:47
Erica Yee,Fire alarm just went off for a hot sec but then it was quiet so think we're ok lol,82,19,19:42:07
Erica Yee,"Way more socializing than I would usually ""schedule"" for my sabbath but I'm just gonna game a bit after dinner and then sleep early",131,24,19:39:43
Erica Yee,Then didn't come back to almost 7 so eating dinner now,54,11,19:39:04
Erica Yee,Woke up a bit before noon feeling pretty rested. Basically only had time to have lunch before going to Chinatown,112,20,19:38:46
Ben Fickes,Howâs your day been?,22,4,19:31:44
Ben Fickes,Yeah thatâs what I figured hah,32,6,19:31:24
Erica Yee,"I just roll my eyes, it doesn't hurt my feelings haha",53,11,19:30:54
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,19:30:12
Ben Fickes,Sorry he left you on read. This just feels like par for the course honestly haha,80,16,19:28:02
Erica Yee,Ok I asked him about his hangout with andrew,44,9,19:26:51
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure! Itâs honestly mild frustration haha I donât mind,67,11,19:25:35
Erica Yee,It's ok if not,14,4,19:25:01
Erica Yee,Ik you feel frustrated about it but do you want to see my latest convo with victor in which he left me on seen,110,24,19:24:59
Erica Yee,Idk when's the last time I had bacon haha,41,9,19:23:44
Ben Fickes,Aw Iâm glad you like it ð,30,7,19:20:40
Erica Yee,Thank you very much,19,4,19:19:38
Erica Yee,This bacon is soooo good,24,5,19:19:30
Erica Yee,I very honestly feel like I still don't know how to code fluently,65,13,19:19:23
Ben Fickes,But also like some people didnât get jobs until after graduation so I guess its okay,86,16,19:14:16
Ben Fickes,"I feel behind sometimes, especially since some people have jobs lined up",72,12,19:13:50
Ben Fickes,Thanks for replying to all that haha. And well fwiw I think you really know what youâre doing and your resumes stacked so I think youâll be fine whenever you apply,167,31,19:13:35
Erica Yee,I felt very behind listening to the other 2 seniors at the AAJA meetup talk about applying to jobs now (though they are applying to internships so deadlines are like now),170,31,19:11:31
Erica Yee,Sounds good,11,2,19:10:13
Erica Yee,Loool ty,8,2,19:09:55
Erica Yee,And ok cool,11,3,19:09:49
Erica Yee,"We can def split, I like both",29,7,19:09:46
Ben Fickes,If thatâs okay,16,3,19:07:33
Ben Fickes,Okay also I have a couple thoughts to tell you about RenÃ©e (I was trying to see how sheâs doing) (oh and she got a job!) and also just random thoughts about my job search but Iâll tell you both in person,208,42,19:07:26
Ben Fickes,"Funny ty story:
Michaels friend: âFriendship is magicâ
Ty: âAnd magic is heresyâ",88,13,19:06:32
Ben Fickes,I am walking! My mom supposed to be getting up early in the morning so as long as her flight isnât delayed sheâll be walking too,132,26,19:05:53
Ben Fickes,Hmmm my instinct is split but ofc if you want one more than the other you can have it,85,19,19:05:19
Erica Yee,Are you walking? When's your mom coming,39,7,18:47:10
Erica Yee,"Got a pork floss and taro, you can choose or we can split them",62,14,18:47:02
Ben Fickes,"Itâs used to cast arcane lock. And thatâs awesome! Look forward to hearing about it. And yeah Iâd love it, thank you :)",125,23,18:42:39
Erica Yee,Well I got one,14,4,18:02:00

Ben Fickes,If you need me to cause a distraction lemme know ð,53,11,18:29:07
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,18:22:45
Erica Yee,"Yes and right now is the time to myself, in an hour is leading time haha",72,16,18:22:40
Ben Fickes,Jesus led and also had time to himself. But I get what youâre saying. Hopefully itâs enjoyable and you can relax and enjoy everyone else,140,25,18:17:08
Erica Yee,"Yeah but I'm going to feel like I need to as a ""leader"" eh",58,14,18:13:32
Ben Fickes,I mean also theyâre your friends so hopefully they understand if you wanna not talk a ton haha,96,18,18:07:42
Erica Yee,Honestly not really up to fellowshiping Jesus help me but ik it'll be good,74,14,18:04:53
Erica Yee,Sounds good,11,2,18:04:25
Ben Fickes,So I can head back with you when youâre done,46,10,18:03:09
Ben Fickes,I will be there watching Jojo and working,41,8,18:03:01
Erica Yee,You know it,11,3,17:56:15
Ben Fickes,Is your worship hangout by any chance in Ryder,46,9,17:50:30
Ben Fickes,I appreciate the gifs greatly haha,34,6,14:47:34
Erica Yee,haha jkjk,9,2,14:45:57
Ben Fickes,ooooh that's very lego movie haha,33,6,14:43:47
Erica Yee,sorry i can't type on computer without autocorrect HAHA,55,9,14:43:42
Erica Yee,*DMs accidentally dropped,25,3,14:43:31
Erica Yee,one of the DM's accidentaly dripped a spell card (or whatever they're called) and the player picks it up,104,19,14:43:18
Erica Yee,ooh ok,6,2,14:43:03
Ben Fickes,maybe the player could have skills like invisibility or something that would help them survive,94,15,14:42:59
Ben Fickes,And the DMs all know where it is but want to be the one to finish the player off,80,19,14:40:48
Ben Fickes,hmmm maybe they're trying to run from monsters and find a way out of the dungeon,80,16,14:40:26
Erica Yee,"no, our game",12,3,14:40:01
Ben Fickes,wait the game I was talking about?,34,7,14:39:53
Erica Yee,"can they scurry around the game to glean hints of ""reality"" or what do they even do",83,17,14:39:37
Erica Yee,this feels like the lego movie,30,6,14:37:17
Ben Fickes,And if you kill the hero with your monster you take control of them,67,14,14:26:41
Ben Fickes,It's a dungeon crawler but only person controls the hero. The others controls monsters,86,14,14:26:30
Ben Fickes,Oh there's a game like that,27,6,14:26:13
Ben Fickes,"If this were an actual game, they'd have to either be AI or have more power",75,16,14:26:06
Ben Fickes,"I think in this scenario, as we have written, anything they do is a token gesture",81,16,14:25:41
Erica Yee,So would the user be able to actually fight back or what happens,64,13,14:25:09
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I guess haha. But Michael tries to make battles that match our strength, not exceed it",91,17,14:20:14
Erica Yee,To an extent,12,3,14:19:43
Erica Yee,But isn't that the usual order of business,42,8,14:19:40
Ben Fickes,I guess it'd be pretty apparent when insanely powerful monsters are trying to kill you,86,15,14:13:14
Ben Fickes,ooh that's a good question,26,5,14:11:51
Erica Yee,Would the audition/competition be apparent at the beginning or revealed as you get to navigate a confusing story,112,18,14:11:37
Erica Yee,Yeah! So the player isn't able to progress like they would expect,65,12,14:10:57
Ben Fickes,I'm just saying if the DMs want the player to die (if that's the competition) they'd never want them to level up,112,22,14:08:05
Erica Yee,"ooh inverting the typical mechanics, i like it",46,8,14:06:29
Ben Fickes,"""Yeah you defeated 20 sorcerers, but I think you're not quite at level 2 yet, sorry!""",85,16,14:06:03
Ben Fickes,also the player would never be allowed to level up,50,10,14:05:39
Ben Fickes,haha yeah,9,2,14:05:30
Erica Yee,"And you're like ""guys I wanna fight too""",40,8,14:04:24
Erica Yee,oooOooO yes,11,2,14:04:13
Ben Fickes,So all the DM's monsters are brawling each other to try to be the one to defeat the player,90,19,14:01:52
Ben Fickes,What if it's like you wanna be the one to take out the player,61,14,14:01:38
Ben Fickes,ooh that would be a good idea,29,7,14:01:16
Erica Yee,yoooo this is a good video game idea,36,8,14:01:01
Ben Fickes,And everyone else controls the story,36,6,14:00:23
Ben Fickes,We can have one player,22,5,14:00:13
Ben Fickes,"""oops, all DMs!""",16,3,14:00:06
Erica Yee,let's have a DM audition,24,5,13:59:49
Erica Yee,ooh yeah,8,2,13:59:45
Ben Fickes,Sometime I wanna try DMing too,30,6,13:58:39
Erica Yee,michael is so thoughtful,24,4,13:58:20
Ben Fickes,But she's gonna make the story so crazy haha,44,9,13:58:14
Ben Fickes,it would be indeed haha,23,5,13:57:49
Erica Yee,DM renee would be lit,21,5,13:57:05
Erica Yee,omg,3,1,13:56:45
Ben Fickes,thanks haha,11,2,13:54:39
Erica Yee,that was my aim!,16,4,13:53:38
Ben Fickes,"thank you for the second emoji, I feel included now",51,10,13:53:11
Erica Yee,ð¤·ââï¸,13,1,13:52:55
Erica Yee,ð¤·ââï¸,13,1,13:52:47
Ben Fickes,Wait how did we not notice she bought those things?,51,10,13:45:07
Ben Fickes,Holy cow I'd be scared too haha,31,7,13:44:55
Erica Yee,I'm scared lol,14,3,13:38:19
Erica Yee,ik you'll be able to figure it out,34,8,13:20:59
Erica Yee,aw noo,6,2,13:20:39
Ben Fickes,Havenât done that much work today but I know all the afternoon/evening is gonna be networks so Iâm trying to get other stuff done now,137,25,13:18:43
Ben Fickes,My computer also was going bonkers for about half an hour,57,11,13:18:14
Ben Fickes,Trying to work on capstone but Iâm trying to animate the character and canât figure it out. So feel very annoyed at unity,125,23,13:18:01
Erica Yee,How are you doing?,18,4,13:00:15
Erica Yee,Can finally close the tabs that have been up for the last week for it,69,15,13:00:10
Ben Fickes,I know you worked a ton on it,29,8,12:59:55
Erica Yee,"Actually not true now that I think about it, but felt like that haha",68,14,12:59:41

Ben Fickes,Did it go okay?,15,4,12:48:50
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,12:48:37
Erica Yee,"We had a quiz I totally forgot about, thankfully it was not the type I could've studied for anyway",98,19,12:48:36
Erica Yee,I took a brief nap after my 8am haha,36,9,12:48:20
Ben Fickes,Remind me to tell you a story about the dnd group chat later please,67,14,12:29:15

Ben Fickes,Dang. Hope you keep feeling better,34,6,12:28:38
Erica Yee,Definitely not going to Jiu-Jitsu class,39,6,12:27:55

Erica Yee,the music is kinda strange. like a lot of random sound effects lol. but guess it's groovy,89,17,13:50:43
Ben Fickes,I know that would terrify me haha,33,7,13:50:34

Erica Yee,"and then one guy is straight up like ""I Volunteer.""",51,10,13:50:21

Ben Fickes,I wanna see if thereâs a two person shooter game we can play,62,13,13:47:07
Erica Yee,Which is dumb considering it's called arcade night,50,8,13:46:34

Ben Fickes,I honestly think Iâll do more arcade than bowling haha,56,10,13:39:56
Erica Yee,"And I was like ""whaaaa why did I do all the puns for then""",58,14,13:38:11

Ben Fickes,Is that what you actually think,31,6,13:21:24
Erica Yee,Would you believe me if I said suit and tie,43,10,13:06:25
Ben Fickes,Like should I wear shorts and a T-shirt or shorts and a collared shirt or nicer than that,89,18,13:04:32
Ben Fickes,Do you know what the dress code is to bowling?,46,10,13:04:06
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, glad youâre a bit better",34,6,13:03:55
Erica Yee,Throat not as raw. But voice still whack and congested,54,10,12:59:49
Erica Yee,Feeling moderately better,25,3,12:59:31
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,12:49:56
Ben Fickes,And itâs not that bad,23,5,12:49:50
Ben Fickes,"Itâs okay, I know it was an accident",38,8,12:49:46
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,12:49:30
Erica Yee,I'm sorry ð,14,3,12:48:13
Erica Yee,Reload unity?,13,2,12:48:07
Ben Fickes,She just didnât reload when she pulled and so she just overwrote the changes and pushed new ones,98,18,12:46:30
Ben Fickes,"No canât really revert. So Iâm just gonna redo my changes. Itâs only the stuff I worked on last night, and hopefully only the scene changes",145,26,12:46:12
Erica Yee,Can you revert or are the conflicts gonna be crazy,50,10,12:45:35
Erica Yee,Omg what,8,2,12:45:24
Ben Fickes,We had a play test in class today and it was alright but Jennifer accidentally deleted a lot of my changes and stuff I fixed...,127,25,12:41:57
Erica Yee,Loool omg,9,2,23:12:03
Ben Fickes,I remember it was on Halloween for the actual bowling day because everyone bowled in costume,92,16,23:10:49
Ben Fickes,Uh we had a rubber ball and pins and just rolled it at the pins,63,15,23:10:27
Ben Fickes,Apparently historically the lowest scoring test in gym,54,8,23:10:14
Erica Yee,Did you actually bowl in gym class??,36,7,23:10:13
Ben Fickes,Junior year,11,2,23:10:03
Ben Fickes,Yeah. Gym class,15,3,23:09:59
Erica Yee,Like for a class?,17,4,23:09:46
Ben Fickes,"On the rules, scoring, and terminology",38,6,23:08:54
Erica Yee,Quiz for what??,15,3,23:08:02
Ben Fickes,Oh I went bowling this summer with kids at volunteering,55,10,23:06:42
Ben Fickes,I would expect not haha,23,5,23:06:31
Ben Fickes,I had to take a bowling quiz in high school haha,48,11,23:06:16
Erica Yee,Not sure about the pace of technological innovation,51,8,23:03:17
Erica Yee,Have bowling alleys evolved to be like super monkey ball by now?,64,12,23:03:00
Erica Yee,I haven't bowled probably since high school lol,47,8,23:02:41
Ben Fickes,I have to mentally review bowling terms for more puns tomorrow,62,11,23:01:07
Ben Fickes,This was fun haha,17,4,23:00:55
Erica Yee,(not actually but this was fun haha),36,7,22:59:33
Erica Yee,Had to have the last word,25,6,22:59:22
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:59:19
Ben Fickes,Is âthe impact was lostâ a pun or just an observation,57,11,22:58:22
Erica Yee,Lol ohhhhh ok,13,3,22:42:11
Ben Fickes,Iâm getting desperate,23,3,22:41:09
Ben Fickes,The lanes are greased to be slippery,36,7,22:41:03
Erica Yee,I don't get yours,17,4,22:40:22
Ben Fickes,But I canât let you outpun me,31,7,22:39:42
Ben Fickes,I was wondering that haha,25,5,22:39:25
Erica Yee,Sophie is just laughing at me without opening the messages,58,10,22:39:21
Erica Yee,Are we that annoying couple lol,31,6,22:38:58
Ben Fickes,Dang I need another pun thatâs not too much a stretch,55,11,22:37:40
Erica Yee,Loool,5,1,22:37:26
Ben Fickes,(That was much weaker),22,4,22:36:46
Ben Fickes,"I guess you missed with this one. But donât worry, Iâm sure youâll get another shot",89,16,22:36:41
Erica Yee,Omg I was gonna use spare next,30,7,22:35:02
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,22:32:25
Ben Fickes,Love the name haha,18,4,22:30:55
Erica Yee,Yah just made group chat,24,5,22:30:25
Ben Fickes,Do you want to meet up to head over to it?,42,11,22:30:13
Erica Yee,Just remembered the arcade thing tomorrow so have less time than I thought haha. But still should be fine,105,19,22:28:19
Erica Yee,Most of it was talking to Sophie but I'm gonna sleep soon,57,12,22:27:42
Erica Yee,But I made some progress,24,5,22:27:24
Erica Yee,Lmao same with my book review,29,6,22:27:21
Ben Fickes,So sounds like he has a lot left haha,37,9,22:23:16
Ben Fickes,Jason just got off the phone and I asked him about the paper. He said âIâm having trouble thinking of a thesis. I feel like the rest of the paper will fall out of that.â,175,35,22:23:09
Ben Fickes,Thanks :) howâs your evening?,31,5,22:22:40
Erica Yee,Well I hope it goes well,24,6,22:13:51
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,22:13:48
Ben Fickes,No I just said I was gonna work on it tonight and he said he can't,66,16,22:07:51
Erica Yee,Do you guys plan when you're next gonna work on it?,51,11,22:04:10
Erica Yee,And that's understandable about Jason..it's definitely ok to rant about it,74,11,22:03:48
Erica Yee,Aw glad to hear it about John,29,7,22:01:59
Ben Fickes,Okay sorry I shouldnât be upset at Jason. He only sees Rachel once or twice a week and I have definitely spent time with you instead of working on networks. So yes I wish he could be working with me but I canât be mad at him for talking to his gf when he feels like he has a lot of work,290,62,21:56:52
Ben Fickes,On John: we had a really good talk. I really miss talking with him. Iâll tell you about it in person more. He has stuff heâs working through but seems to be doing pretty well overall and also seems to be conscious of making sure he doesnât spiral again,258,49,21:53:13
Ben Fickes,Okay in response to your messages: I appreciate the sharing and the extrapolation comment haha,94,15,21:51:58
Ben Fickes,Anyways heâs entitled to do what he wants but Iâm gonna be working on networks so,85,16,21:51:26
Ben Fickes,But he played a little smash which he said was a break which I can understand. But now heâs on the phone with Rachel in his bedroom,133,27,21:50:53
Ben Fickes,Jason said he couldnât work on networks tonight or come to menâs group because of a paper he has due tomorrow,113,21,21:50:22
Ben Fickes,Yeah it was great! Will tell you about it shortly. First I need to rant,71,15,21:50:01
Erica Yee,"Oh that's great! I'm so glad you guys have this time, especially since I know you said you wanted to hang out with him more the other day",137,28,21:33:25
Ben Fickes,He went to pee but is coming back so will read and reply to the rest later,74,17,21:32:22
Ben Fickes,Menâs group was alright. But John said he wanted to talk after and weâve been talking for the past hour and honestly itâs amazing,135,24,21:32:10
Erica Yee,This can be extrapolated to other things in his life lol ð,61,12,21:19:11
Erica Yee,"V: Bobame gave me a stomachache
Me: oh noooooo what did you get?
V: I'm just lactose intolerant",95,18,21:18:47
Erica Yee,Want to hear the epitome of conversations with victor,53,9,21:17:54
Erica Yee,I just listened to Sophie rant for an hour about club stuff,59,12,21:02:52
Erica Yee,How was it?,11,3,21:02:07
Ben Fickes,"It is haha, we just started late",32,7,20:38:45
Erica Yee,Is men's group not rn lol,25,6,19:27:33
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I don't need it but will ask her",40,9,19:27:30
Ben Fickes,Feel free to use mine! For either of you,40,9,19:26:55
Erica Yee,"According to Vivian, Willis laundry room is flooded lol",55,9,19:26:21
Ben Fickes,And nice haha,13,3,19:11:04
Ben Fickes,Oh cool thanks for sharing :),29,6,19:10:53
Erica Yee,Lol Daniella,12,2,19:05:53
Erica Yee,Actually I take back the mixing part. I'm not entirely sure. But definitely they oversee the recording and mixing,113,19,19:01:33
Erica Yee,Usually manages the recording process I think. So like can tell the singer/instrumentalist to adjust things,107,16,19:00:19
Erica Yee,A ton. Like probably the most relatively. They mix the vocals/instrumentation together,86,12,18:59:29
Ben Fickes,I do remember! And ah gotcha haha. How much role does the producer have in how it sounds?,89,18,18:58:02
Erica Yee,"Just found out one of my favorite electronic producers (Zedd) produced it, so that's partly why I like the vibe/sound so much haha",130,23,18:56:56
Erica Yee,"Speaking of music, you know how I was obsessed with the Katy Perry song ""never really over"" over the summer??",109,20,18:56:17
Ben Fickes,He knows a ton of songs actually,32,7,18:54:45
Erica Yee,Also v impressed Jason knows the song,37,7,18:45:05
Erica Yee,I'm gonna sing it that way from now on,38,9,18:40:46
Erica Yee,I love it,9,3,18:40:40
Erica Yee,HAHA OMG,8,2,18:40:35
Ben Fickes,"Jason started singing âif we were a movieâ but he just kept repeating the (madeup) line âif we were a movie, youâd be the white guy that I fell in love with.â I told him you really like that song and he said, âsee, youâre the white guy!â",253,48,18:39:08
Ben Fickes,Thank you Erica :) John is coming!,34,7,18:37:22
Erica Yee,Praying for good discussion and fellowship at men's group,57,9,18:26:39
Erica Yee,Ooh ok hope it goes well,24,6,15:48:43
Ben Fickes,I have my midterm review session soon and hoping I can stay focused for that haha,81,16,15:42:46
Ben Fickes,Aw no Iâm sorry to hear that,30,7,15:42:31
Erica Yee,Will reply to email later tho cuz my mind is kinda dead rn haha,63,14,15:32:22
Erica Yee,Probably but need to talk to him,32,7,15:32:07
Ben Fickes,"And nice haha, that is funny",28,6,15:30:07
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð nice. Are you going to?,33,7,15:29:53
Erica Yee,Also one of the journalism professors emailed me basically congratulating me on being the only IS/journalism major ever and asking if I want to change my major name to data science/journalism to be more relevant/marketable LOLOL,228,36,15:24:26
Erica Yee,ð omg,8,2,15:21:42
Erica Yee,"Your choices will be remembered throughout the game, and culminate in one of six different endings, that's more than Mass Effect 3.",131,22,15:21:38
Erica Yee,And this is in the description:,31,6,15:21:34
Erica Yee,I was playing this game called parable made on twine,52,10,15:21:28
Ben Fickes,"Ooh thanks for letting me know, I wanna check it out sometime",61,12,15:21:08
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð thatâs hilarious, thanks for sharing. And wow Iâm so proud of you",79,14,15:20:50
Erica Yee,"Also twine is so cool, think I'm gonna use it for my book project",65,14,14:52:40
Erica Yee,I did eat the sandwich in class haha,36,8,14:52:28
Erica Yee,I'm listening to a podcast for worship leaders but the episode is from January 2018 and they're talking about how reckless love is rising in popularity lolol,157,27,13:29:04
Erica Yee,Ofc,3,1,13:28:03
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening haha,25,4,13:12:10
Erica Yee,Ooh okay,8,2,13:09:30
Ben Fickes,"I worked on networks in writing class haha. I thought we had an issue with failing tests but we actually are doing the right stuff, just timing out. So not the end of the world",176,35,13:05:41
Erica Yee,Oh yay! But yikes haha,22,5,13:04:43
Ben Fickes,Haha ð thanks for looking out for me by forgetting haha,58,11,13:04:28
Erica Yee,I was actually gonna tell you but I forgot. And good thing I didn't because it would've only led to disappointment,114,21,13:04:07
Ben Fickes,We were diving work for next week and she reminded me that networks proj is due so neither of us are gonna have any time to work on capstone haha,145,30,13:04:04
Ben Fickes,"Dang I wish I had gone for burgers haha. Capstone was good, Jennifer still has some work to do and I technically have a small amount when sheâs done",150,29,13:03:37
Erica Yee,How was your capstone meeting?,30,5,13:01:22
Erica Yee,Probably not cuz banhmis are very messy and class is in a conference room,73,14,13:01:01
Erica Yee,Oh it was centennial...I swore she said krentzman oops,54,9,13:00:47
Erica Yee,With meds haha ð,19,4,13:00:21
Ben Fickes,Can you eat the sandwich in class?,34,7,13:00:19
Ben Fickes,Thatâs amazing your headache went away!,41,6,13:00:12
Erica Yee,"I went to krentzman cuz Sophie said her club was serving free burgers 12-1 but no one was there. So went to CVS like I planned and decided to try the new banh mi place cuz I'm over here already. Ordered takeout but it's gonna take 15 mins (for a sandwich lol), so probably will not have time to eat anything before class but oh well",332,66,12:58:28
Erica Yee,Headache went away,18,3,12:56:20
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,12:55:34
Ben Fickes,Dang I'm sorry. As always lemme know if I can help in any way,61,14,11:09:01
Erica Yee,But feel pretty bad all around rn so idk lol,44,10,11:01:50
Erica Yee,Not at the moment,17,4,11:01:31
Ben Fickes,Maybe it's hard to tell with the headache but do you feel any less sick?,72,15,10:55:19
Ben Fickes,Dang I'm sorry. I hope you feel better soon,43,9,10:55:05
Erica Yee,And now I heard facilities come in but I'm still in my bedroom and hopefully they just do their thing out there so I don't have to talk to them,143,30,10:52:30
Erica Yee,So I woke up with a headache that is definitely because of all the decongestants I took,87,17,10:51:39
Ben Fickes,Here,4,1,17:13:19
Ben Fickes,Omw,3,1,17:10:20

Ben Fickes,Sorry little later than 5 havenât showered yet,48,8,16:49:09
Erica Yee,Sounds good,11,2,16:40:34
Ben Fickes,"Just got back from my run, I have to shower and change but then Iâll be over. Probably around 5",97,20,16:39:05
Ben Fickes,I did 4 rounds I think,22,6,16:38:41
Erica Yee,How did you attack eggman so much in the last hour or so lol,60,14,15:56:52
Erica Yee,it's all of our story,21,5,15:37:01
Ben Fickes,I thought so but figured Iâd ask haha. And oh so is it your cult then?,72,16,15:35:29
Erica Yee,Not even my story either ð,29,6,15:30:41
Erica Yee,Former haha,11,2,15:30:24
Ben Fickes,A small story about a cult or a story about a small cult,56,13,15:29:24
Erica Yee,Remind me to tell you small cult story,38,8,15:28:44
Erica Yee,Yeah it's even closer than the new one in mission hill,54,11,14:01:26
Ben Fickes,That's not a bad walk at all,28,7,14:01:04
Ben Fickes,"Okay cool, I can picture the general area",41,8,14:00:55
Erica Yee,But before dumpling palace/pho basil,36,5,14:00:42

Erica Yee,nah i'm not going to bale agan anytime soon,43,9,13:59:24
Ben Fickes,But would prefer closer,23,4,13:56:23
Ben Fickes,And if Victor wants to go to bale I'll go with if you want haha,63,15,13:56:17
Ben Fickes,Well I'm definitely down to try it,34,7,13:56:05
Erica Yee,"I asked Victor and he was like ""bale""",37,8,13:55:48
Erica Yee,And sophie says it's good so I wanna try it sometime,52,11,13:55:39
Erica Yee,Anyway there's a new place on Mass Ave where the sushi place used to be near the hardware store,95,19,13:55:30
Erica Yee,Lmaoo,5,1,13:55:10
Ben Fickes,He brought it up once and I said I preferred somewhere closer,61,12,13:49:55
Ben Fickes,No not yet haha,15,4,13:49:44
Erica Yee,Victor never dragged you to bale in Dorchester?!,48,8,13:49:35
Ben Fickes,But they're food so yes,23,5,13:46:39
Ben Fickes,I don't know if I've had them really,36,8,13:46:34
Erica Yee,Do you like Vietnamese sandwiches,33,5,13:45:14
Erica Yee,Tried once and he replied in one word answers,45,9,13:45:08
Erica Yee,No idea never talked to him,27,6,13:45:01
Ben Fickes,haha is he into zombies?,24,5,13:41:47
Erica Yee,Jk please don't,15,3,13:34:48

Ben Fickes,"No you donât have to stop, I enjoy hearing about it :)",56,12,13:32:52
Erica Yee,Sorry I'll stop haha,20,4,13:27:13
Erica Yee,This might make my life so much easier,38,8,13:26:47
Erica Yee,New potential data*,19,3,13:26:40
Erica Yee,The new data is already in csv,30,7,13:26:32
Erica Yee,Omgomgomgomg,12,1,13:26:25
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm really sorry to hear that,36,7,13:24:46
Erica Yee,Lol jason,9,2,13:23:56
Erica Yee,Sorry got interrupted between messages,38,5,13:23:54
Erica Yee,LOL ð­ð­ that's all I've doing these last few days. However I think we tweaked the project enough today that it might be possible and easier without the original database,174,30,13:23:39
Ben Fickes,"Me: *shows Jason something*
Jason: thatâs cool
Jason: but have you heard of drugs",83,14,13:20:53
Ben Fickes,I have my own story,19,5,13:20:24
Ben Fickes,Daaaang Iâm sorry haha,24,4,13:20:19
Erica Yee,"Me last week: *gives project update*
Prof: do a lit review into naive Bayes classifiers
Me this week: goes down a huge rabbit hole of probability models
Prof today: nevermind naive Bayes is not what you want",207,37,13:19:01
Erica Yee,Cool just lemme know when you're ready,38,7,11:55:17
Ben Fickes,Oh no worries! Iâll see you later :),38,8,11:53:06
Erica Yee,"You can come over right before LG, np",37,8,11:42:44
Erica Yee,Ah I'm gonna be at Snell till office hours at 1pm,49,11,11:42:30
Ben Fickes,"Sure! So I was gonna run after my second class - I can come over between now and then or after I run (Iâll probably get back around 5 - not a ton of time, sorry)",163,36,11:41:17
Erica Yee,I was gonna finish the kigo for dinner but you can have frozen food if you want,79,17,11:40:39
Erica Yee,Though if you didn't get sick from me last semester you're probably pretty invincible,85,14,11:40:18
Erica Yee,If you don't mind be around my germs,36,8,11:39:49
Erica Yee,Do you want to come over and work between your class and LG?,60,13,11:39:42
Erica Yee,Sounds good haha,16,3,10:21:07
Ben Fickes,Plus we can grab dinner after (even though it'll be lateish),60,11,10:15:29
Ben Fickes,Well my thought process is I can always eat a meal's worth of snacks,68,14,10:15:15
Erica Yee,"Ooh 17 min walk, nice",21,5,10:14:48
Erica Yee,But sounds good. Other event also has snacks so I'll survive,60,11,10:14:24
Erica Yee,Uhh idk about that haha,23,5,10:14:15
Ben Fickes,"My guess is dinner, since if they're paying for us each to have a drink, I'd think they'd pay for us to have a meal",115,25,10:08:31
Ben Fickes,Oh it literally just says food,30,6,10:07:12
Ben Fickes,Lemme check,11,2,10:06:34
Ben Fickes,"Hmmmm I know there's food at least, don't remember if it was snacks or dinner",77,15,10:06:23
Erica Yee,Cuz there's an event on campus at 5 i want to go to and think I can make both,77,19,10:06:04
Erica Yee,Is there dinner? I forgot,25,5,10:05:44
Erica Yee,I paid so really hope so,24,6,10:05:36
Ben Fickes,Oh do you think you'll go to the arcade night on Thursday?,58,12,10:04:25
Ben Fickes,Haha I'm very sorry,19,4,10:04:05
Erica Yee,800ish words.. so maybe I'll just outline it and then have a sad Friday afternoon,81,15,10:03:20
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang haha. Well idk how long it is - if it's really short maybe it's worth waiting, but if not, I'm sure you'll have good opinions and insight haha so you shouldn't be afraid to start earlier",194,38,10:02:09
Erica Yee,So do I wait for that?? What if my opinions are wrong lol,57,13,10:00:39
Erica Yee,"Ohhh also the book review for ethics is due Friday 5pm so I wanna start it today, but we're discussing the book in class Friday 8am",131,26,10:00:27
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. You can probably let them know your voice hurts and maybe they wonât ask as lengthy questions haha,108,19,9:54:16
Erica Yee,"Same, throat still hurts. But guess voice is slightly more consistent so I shouldn't cancel my one on one with the professor",124,22,9:51:32
Erica Yee,The whole trip took 3 mins haha,31,7,9:51:02
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling?,20,4,9:50:14
Ben Fickes,Dang you went back during break? Guess it is close by,53,11,9:50:08
Erica Yee,Thanks haha that makes me feel better,37,7,9:49:41
Erica Yee,I ran back during class break to refill my tea and it was dark and quiet so I thought no one was home which is why I took it..,126,29,9:49:33
Ben Fickes,"Dang Iâm sorry. For what itâs worth, donât think anyone should be too uptight about water haha",100,17,9:49:11
Erica Yee,Also she just leaves it in the boiler for a long time without using it so I just assumed it's leftover lol,106,22,9:49:04
Erica Yee,"Oops got chewed out by Mary for ""always"" taking her boiled water (think it's been like twice). In my view I don't care if someone takes water I boil because they get to it first, I can just make more. But I guess I projected that unfairly onto others",250,49,9:48:19
Ben Fickes,Oh I think you were mentioning that. See you tomorrow!,54,10,22:35:08
Erica Yee,See you tomorrow :),19,4,22:34:11
Erica Yee,We'll see .. it's kind of going backwards in my project but it's necessary,74,14,22:34:07
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well hopefully it's not bad?,39,7,22:33:14
Erica Yee,I still have to synthesize and write stuff before me professor meeting at 1pm tomorrow which stresses me out cuz I don't like doing things day of but oh well it'll be worth it to be there for whole LG,200,40,22:32:14
Ben Fickes,Hope you sleep well,19,4,22:30:50
Ben Fickes,And I'm sure Barbs was thrilled with that haha,46,9,22:30:44
Ben Fickes,Glad you had a good talk with them!,35,8,22:30:34
Ben Fickes,"No worries! I was the one who left. Sorry I didn't stay to talk, I just had work (didn't know you'd be working) and also wanted to save your voice",146,30,22:30:26
Erica Yee,Then stayed in the classroom doing work with them but going to bed now (Mary called off today meeting bc too much hw..),119,23,22:27:21
Erica Yee,"Chatting with Vivian, Dara and Emily about tomorrow's talk and then just in general was super good though. Even if I regret using my voice more haha",148,27,22:26:27
Erica Yee,Thank you so much again for dinner. Really needed it. Sorry didn't get to talk to you,85,17,22:25:35
Erica Yee,I'm coming back,15,3,20:10:12

Erica Yee,Yeah not rn lol. Any other announcements?,41,7,19:56:12
Erica Yee,I would actually really appreciate that if you're sure you don't need the dinner,80,14,19:55:45
Ben Fickes,"They need people to table for beyond color blindness, which Iâm guessing you canât do rn haha",97,17,19:53:00
Ben Fickes,Just dinner and prayer time. Do you still want kigo? I can bring it to you,74,16,19:52:34

Erica Yee,Oooh,4,1,19:38:41

Erica Yee,I microwaved the rest of my salad from yesterday and it takes 10 times better warm lol,86,17,17:46:14
Erica Yee,"I actually was thinking of going to class, saying I'm sick, and them going to ST lol",84,17,17:44:03
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry. Def okaynif uou skip st,41,8,17:43:15

Ben Fickes,"As always, lemme know if I can do anything to help",50,11,9:57:37
Erica Yee,I could've redone the autocorrect from my swipe texting but this was funnier,76,13,9:56:32
Erica Yee,Thanks for being an amazing borderlands,39,6,9:55:51
Erica Yee,Ohhh wowwwww you too,20,4,9:55:26

Ben Fickes,"Also, unrelatedly, happy 9 months of dating haha",48,8,9:50:47
Ben Fickes,I feel fine right now,21,5,9:50:33
Ben Fickes,"Oh no, I hope you feel better. Iâm really sorry because Iâm sure staying up late on Saturday didnât help your immune system",129,23,9:50:24
Erica Yee,Really hope I didn't give anything to you,41,8,9:34:23
Erica Yee,I feel more sick now,20,5,9:34:13
Ben Fickes,Dang I wanna try it sometime haha,33,7,22:27:23
Erica Yee,So wild,7,2,22:14:44

Ben Fickes,You might be right - Iâll ask on Wednesday,44,9,21:00:21
Erica Yee,At first I thought it might be pillars like Greek columns. But guess it would be rounded,88,17,20:58:55
Ben Fickes,Not to my knowledge haha,24,5,20:53:15
Ben Fickes,Huh thatâs a good question,28,5,20:53:10

Erica Yee,Think I will use the rest of tonight to work and sleep early,60,13,20:47:12
Ben Fickes,"Was gonna ask if you wanted to watch a movie or game (but do not want to stay up late tonight) but if youâre working no prob, there will be other opportunities haha",166,33,20:44:29
Ben Fickes,I have a little (like very little) soft dev so Iâll prob be done by 9,71,16,20:43:38
Erica Yee,Are you still doing work?,25,5,20:43:08

Ben Fickes,Dang. Well hope it goes well. And that there are no personality clashes haha,76,14,20:39:42
Erica Yee,So it is still a mystery haha. But hopefully we'll talk tomorrow,64,12,20:34:57
Erica Yee,And then she says we can text about it bc we have different schedules. So I ask what's the issue with the living room (cuz I really have no idea and hardly use it). Then Barbara is like let's find a time in person,213,44,20:34:46
Erica Yee,"Mary texted the group chat saying we should talk about apartment stuff because she thinks our view of the kitchen is different from hers, and her view of the common area is different from ours. We're all like ok let's talk",222,41,20:33:43
Erica Yee,"Mainly ate dinner and did chores, now back to work",50,10,20:32:32

Erica Yee,Chilling has been very very nice. Shooting things and listening to Christian podcasts,85,13,16:06:41
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Throat is better but voice is still pretty gone,55,11,16:06:17
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,16:05:55
Ben Fickes,Tyâs character is named Titus haha,36,6,16:03:58
Ben Fickes,How are you doing,17,4,16:03:46
Ben Fickes,Itâs good. Little hard for me to be in character/know what his character is completely. But heâs good in battle,115,20,16:03:43
Erica Yee,How is it,9,3,16:02:35
Erica Yee,Haha,4,1,16:02:34
Ben Fickes,I summoned my turret and I feel like my character in b2 haha,60,13,15:57:01

Erica Yee,Know you have dnd but i just summoned started a boss (ebitan) haha,66,13,12:38:49
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,11:58:06
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey! And glad youâre able to read some haha,51,9,11:55:25
Erica Yee,I was worried I couldn't finish this book in a week but the Lord provides and I am demolishing it,97,20,11:51:13
Erica Yee,Maybe if I don't talk the whole day it'll come back,51,11,11:50:50
Erica Yee,Ehh I'll let you know later,27,6,11:50:42
Erica Yee,"Yep everyone's white. Last book I read (the wedding party one, not the brooding YA hero one) protags were both black",116,21,11:50:26
Ben Fickes,So do you wanna cancel dessert too? Or we can do zombies instead of dessert haha,80,16,11:48:24
Ben Fickes,Ah I see. Are the main characters white?,40,8,11:48:05
Erica Yee,Ok I think I'm gonna cancel dinner. What's the point if it's just gonna be me trying to talk a lot,98,21,11:44:41
Erica Yee,More like the vibe. White people talking about how white maine is was interesting,81,14,11:44:04
Ben Fickes,Tell me what you learn haha,27,6,11:37:49
Erica Yee,Oh also it takes place in Maine and there's a brief trip to Boston (actually Somerville haha) and I feel like I'm learning more about new England,145,27,11:35:16
Erica Yee,Too bad I can't see yours,25,6,11:34:46
Ben Fickes,95% of the time,15,4,11:32:11
Ben Fickes,Hmm I can see how that would be weird. I see your point of view haha,68,16,11:32:05
Erica Yee,Idk maybe I'm being too harsh,29,6,11:31:02
Erica Yee,"The only thing annoying about the book is it's like 95% in third person from the girl's POV but sometimes there will be a random section from the guy's and it's just like...either split up the chapters more evenly or not at all. I feel like the author is ""cheating"" a little like she wants to tell the reader something from his mind and couldn't think of any other way",368,70,11:30:56
Ben Fickes,ð¬,4,1,11:30:11
Erica Yee,Hope you like it,16,4,11:29:29
Ben Fickes,Itâs a whole new side of you,30,7,11:28:26
Ben Fickes,Iâm excited,13,2,11:28:09
Erica Yee,I need to start using ð again more. I always forget about it,63,13,11:25:14
Ben Fickes,And nice haha glad you found something that speaks to you,57,11,11:24:47
Ben Fickes,I feel like Iâd like the slow build,37,8,11:24:33
Erica Yee,"Also this quote is very relatable:
She sent him back the emoji with the tense, grimacing mouthful of teeth. The one she always thought of as Mr. Okaaaaay.",154,28,11:23:15
Erica Yee,Haha not the greatest example but I highlighted it,50,9,11:22:44
Erica Yee,Hm,2,1,11:21:49
Erica Yee,Builds slowly. Like very character driven as you see their relationship develop,79,12,11:21:47
Ben Fickes,What is some sample dialog thatâs ðð if you donât mind sharing,72,12,11:20:28
Ben Fickes,Does slow burn mean it happens slowly or falls apart slowly,59,11,11:20:04
Erica Yee,"The writing, especially the dialogue, is so ðð",52,8,11:19:47
Erica Yee,Slow burn romance,17,3,11:19:32
Erica Yee,"""an unlikely relationship between a young woman who's lost her husband and a major league pitcher who's lost his game""",118,20,11:19:21
Ben Fickes,Whatâs it about?,18,3,11:15:28
Erica Yee,Omg the book I'm reading is soooo gooooood,42,8,11:15:10
Erica Yee,No actually haha,16,3,11:15:03

Erica Yee,I feel loved,12,3,11:14:44
Ben Fickes,I feel so hurt,14,4,11:10:04
Ben Fickes,Wow I would be willing to trade at least three toes for you,59,13,11:09:53
Ben Fickes,Haha youâre not dumb either just had to make the joke,55,11,11:09:42
Ben Fickes,No of course not â¤ï¸ youâre not 16!,40,8,11:08:57
Erica Yee,Hmm I might be willing to trade a couple toes for you,53,12,11:05:39
Erica Yee,I wanna beeeeee where the people areeeeee,41,7,11:03:48
Erica Yee,Am I a dumb 16 year old ð,28,8,11:02:41
Ben Fickes,But the Charles river is nearby so maybe thatâs not necessary,63,11,11:00:25
Ben Fickes,If youâre a mermaid and you traded your voice for legs so you could be with me Iâm very greatful,100,20,11:00:12
Ben Fickes,Well thatâs good youâre not feeling bad. Hope your voice comes back soon,76,13,10:59:48
Erica Yee,Don't feel sick otherwise,25,4,10:53:35
Erica Yee,So idk what it is,17,5,10:53:28
Erica Yee,It's just my throat and voice,29,6,10:53:24
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. How are you feeling? Like beyond your voice? Do you feel sick?,70,13,10:47:40
Erica Yee,"I cancelled Bible study, hopefully will be ok for dinner",56,10,10:47:12
Erica Yee,Glad I'm not the only one to stay late ð,43,10,10:46:48
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,10:46:34

Erica Yee,Did everyone help clean haha,28,5,10:44:22
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,10:05:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure! Hope you feel better soon,40,8,10:02:32
Erica Yee,Think I'm gonna stay home this morning if that's ok,51,10,9:58:02
Erica Yee,"Not sure, also have Bible study and dinner..",44,8,9:57:50

Erica Yee,Can I let you know how I feel when I wake up,44,12,23:41:47
Ben Fickes,No pressure but do you wanna hang out before dnd/dinner tomorrow? I have some thoughts on stuff we talked about with corinthians but also I just miss getting to talk with you. Really no pressure though because Iâll see you in the evening!,240,43,23:40:26

Ben Fickes,"He was talking to Michael and Sabrina and others about planes. And Michael mentioned that he had been to China, and listed places he had been. And at the end he said Hong Kong. And Victor said, âFinally! Someone who recognizes Hong Kong as part of China!â And everyone got really quiet, Michael said he didnât mean it as a political statement, and then Sabrina said, âUh, my parents are from Hong Kong.â Anyways not sure where the convo went from there because I left (since he was definitely a part of the convo...) after trying to hint that maybe victor shouldnât bring that up",591,105,20:45:26
Ben Fickes,But he got into one,19,5,20:42:19
Ben Fickes,Yeah I could just tell he was trying to enter convos but people were ignoring him,81,16,20:42:14

Erica Yee,And ok thanks,13,3,16:20:56

Ben Fickes,At least you seem to have no shortage of ideas for this haha,60,13,14:45:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah I can see that haha,24,6,14:45:41
Erica Yee,I could totally go down a rabbit hole with the research..,57,11,14:44:05
Ben Fickes,Haha that would be pretty cool. You'd learn about all these people too I guess,78,15,14:41:14

Ben Fickes,Dang haha thatâs crazy. Why have audio books when you can burn olfactory books,80,14,14:57:34
Erica Yee,"5 mins before the end of book class this fire marshal comes in. Professor is like ""oh you're here for my next class right? It actually starts in 15 mins"" Then to us: ""we're burning something in my next class"" and then then the marshal says ""I just got an emergency call at light hall"" and leaves. We tell the professor how far away light hall is and he's like omg what. So hopefully the emergency gets resolved and the marshal will come back in time haha",454,87,14:46:47
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,14:44:02

Ben Fickes,He brainstormed stuff like being a soul transformed into a golem. But I pointed out that I wouldnât be a gnome then,117,22,12:21:17
Ben Fickes,But heâs gonna think on a replacement,39,7,12:20:55

Ben Fickes,Yeah that was the pronunciation I had in mind for it,52,11,11:44:22
Erica Yee,Is that what you're going for?,30,6,11:43:32
Erica Yee,Second one seems like it would be pronounced with one syllable,62,11,11:43:28

Erica Yee,How was kids church and bbq,27,6,12:54:44
Erica Yee,Like you have an idea or just don't like current?,49,10,12:54:33

Ben Fickes,How are you feeling today?,26,5,11:09:07
Ben Fickes,I have to tell you about my dnd dream still,43,10,11:09:00
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs hilarious haha, thanks for sharing",43,6,11:08:47
Erica Yee,"Dreamt that I was at retreat and we played a game in the main large group room where we had to take off our shoes and socks that was meant to teach us something about climate change and when it was over I couldn't find my socks, only a different style pair of the same brand and it stressed me out ð",302,62,10:25:10
Ben Fickes,Was asleep haha,15,3,7:18:30

Erica Yee,Ugh I'll just get it,20,5,16:35:24
Erica Yee,Eh I'm feeling very lazy tho,28,6,16:34:47
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,16:34:41
Ben Fickes,I was planning on working later at some point,45,9,16:33:25
Erica Yee,"If so I will get my laptop, if not I'll just go straight to yours (if that's ok)",80,18,16:27:28
Erica Yee,Are you planning on working later?,34,6,16:26:55
Erica Yee,"So I was like ""oh I'll go with you guys but I'm not gonna get anything"" and then they decided they were too full as well so we're heading back",142,30,16:26:28
Ben Fickes,Jk haha,7,2,16:18:46
Ben Fickes,And barbs says Iâm the one that eats a lot...,47,10,16:18:44
Ben Fickes,Dang wow,8,2,16:18:35
Erica Yee,And we're already having soft serve,35,6,16:08:48
Ben Fickes,"After a buffet? Brave haha. And gotcha, like I said no rush at all",66,14,16:06:25
Erica Yee,But don't want to Lyft back by myself so,40,9,16:06:06
Erica Yee,Lol,3,1,16:05:55
Erica Yee,Idk how stomach would take it look,34,7,16:05:54
Erica Yee,They wanna go get boba..,24,5,16:05:45
Ben Fickes,"No worries, take all the time you need!",39,8,16:04:34
Erica Yee,We're finishing up,18,3,16:04:21
Erica Yee,Sorry sorry yes I was just about to text you,44,10,16:04:09
Ben Fickes,Are you at lunch still?,23,5,16:03:36
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,13:49:18
Ben Fickes,Dang at this time? Marcus mentioned it was crowded on weekends,62,11,13:47:36
Erica Yee,So now we are wandering through a pet store,43,9,13:46:51
Erica Yee,We just got to the restaurant and 40 minute wait lmao,53,11,13:46:37
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,13:46:28
Ben Fickes,I actually just talked to josh for an hour and a half. Mostly about dnd haha,76,16,13:40:22
Erica Yee,How's writing,13,2,13:38:19
Erica Yee,Oh yes haha,11,3,13:38:07
Ben Fickes,"No, I was gonna ask if you still liked it and decided to exaggerate",67,14,13:35:08
Erica Yee,Is that a reference,19,4,13:33:27
Ben Fickes,Is it still all you dreamed and more,36,8,13:27:43
Erica Yee,I played metro for like 20 mins before I had to go haha,55,13,13:26:27
Erica Yee,Yeah I was shook,16,4,13:25:47
Ben Fickes,Ah I see. I like those kind of plot twists,42,10,13:17:18
Erica Yee,Bait and switch where the whole time it's hinting that the girl's past will catch up to them because like 3/4 of the book is in her perspective so you just hear her fears more. But it's actually someone with a grudge against him (who seemed like a minor side character but has a backstory) who is the threat the whole time,322,62,13:16:29
Ben Fickes,Oh wow what was it?,19,5,13:01:48
Erica Yee,I'm almost done with my book (way shorter than last one I read) and I did not see the twist coming WHATSOEVER omg,113,23,11:50:27
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,11:50:01
Ben Fickes,I slept in so feel fine tiredness wise,38,8,11:43:59
Ben Fickes,Iâm good! Dan and I just cleaned. Now Iâm just chilling (gonna write some) which is nice,92,17,11:43:51
Erica Yee,How are you doing?,18,4,11:43:17
Erica Yee,"And all good, I enjoy all our time together",43,9,11:40:34
Erica Yee,A bit tired but actually not sore as expected besides my arms,61,12,11:40:18
Erica Yee,It was fine Justin was like 20 mins late lmao,45,10,11:39:53
Ben Fickes,Oh my word Iâm sorry for staying so late. How are you feeling?,64,13,11:39:11
Erica Yee,My arms felt/feel so week though lol,36,7,11:38:14
Erica Yee,Yes woke up at 725...,21,5,11:38:03
Ben Fickes,Did you go to tennis?,21,5,11:29:07
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm super excited to hear about it,41,8,11:28:59
Erica Yee,We had our longest conversation ever I think lol. Will tell you about in person,79,15,11:26:51
Erica Yee,Mary says she's a Christian ð®ð® which is not that surprising given she's Armenian but I was a little shook given her questions,131,23,11:26:36
Erica Yee,Neither!! Don't think either is awake to have drama yet haha,60,11,11:25:45
Ben Fickes,(Victor or Calvin?),19,3,11:17:59
Ben Fickes,What,4,1,11:17:52
Erica Yee,Guess what,10,2,11:13:23
Ben Fickes,Okay gonna head over now,24,5,19:12:59
Ben Fickes,Np haha,7,2,19:05:45
Erica Yee,Yes please,10,2,19:05:35
Erica Yee,We're at squash,15,3,19:05:30
Erica Yee,Actually like 5 mins sorry Vivian needs to change,49,9,19:05:24
Ben Fickes,Do you want me to bring pumpkin pie or not,42,10,19:03:32
Ben Fickes,"Sure, be right over",19,4,19:03:15
Erica Yee,Now if that's ok,16,4,19:03:05
Ben Fickes,Should I head over now or in a bit?,35,9,19:01:53
Erica Yee,Just finished and heading back,30,5,18:59:30
Ben Fickes,Going to go for a run - should be back by the time your class is done but wanted to let you know in case somehow it takes longer,128,29,17:12:57
Ben Fickes,Nice emoji choice haha,22,4,15:25:19
Erica Yee,Putting rice on a timer and hoping it cooks by the right time ð,66,14,15:18:21
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,12:09:47
Erica Yee,2 tbsp please,13,3,12:03:01
Ben Fickes,How much,8,2,12:01:03
Ben Fickes,Sure,4,1,12:00:59
Erica Yee,Can you bring ketchup tonight please,36,6,11:48:52
Erica Yee,LOL omg,7,2,10:51:23
Ben Fickes,"Of course I am. And unrelatedly, Iâve made a lot of progress in SEGA heroes recently",86,16,10:47:25
Erica Yee,It's ok I know you're hard at work taking notes,47,10,10:46:52
Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬,8,1,10:46:35
Ben Fickes,"No code, just conceptual",24,4,10:42:07
Ben Fickes,Weâre learning what unit tests are,36,6,10:42:00
Ben Fickes,Wow I really had no reason o come to class,42,10,10:41:52
Ben Fickes,For telling me the book name I guess haha,41,9,10:41:39
Erica Yee,Why haha,8,2,10:41:10
Ben Fickes,Thanks!,7,1,10:40:03
Erica Yee,Uhh run aground I think,23,5,10:29:20
Ben Fickes,Whatâs the book called?,25,4,10:22:52
Ben Fickes,Dang that is very impressive,28,5,10:22:48
Erica Yee,Also each of her 4 siblings have their own personality and somehow it's pretty easy to keep track of even though that's a lot of characters so ðð,151,28,10:19:54
Erica Yee,Yah,3,1,10:19:25
Ben Fickes,Wow. Well I look forward to hearing about it more as you read,61,13,10:16:59
Erica Yee,"The writing's really good. Both protags have realistic motivations that prevent them from acting on their feelings to extent and you really feel for them (her - take care of siblings and don't get caught by law enforcement, him - dealing with trauma because his partner killed himself a few months ago and now he's left with his partner's K-9 ð¢)",348,61,10:15:00
Ben Fickes,And hopefully,13,2,10:11:37
Ben Fickes,Wow thatâs really interesting. What are the things you like about it?,71,12,10:11:33
Erica Yee,Hopefully not cuz it's just my nose. Might be allergies since I have sneezed a bit more I guess,95,19,10:11:17
Erica Yee,"Also I started a new book yesterday on the bus and it's quite good. Contemporary story about this woman who ""kidnaps"" her half siblings to get them out of an abusive situation and then falls in love with a cop",209,40,10:10:40
Ben Fickes,Aw dang are you feeling sick?,29,6,10:09:48
Erica Yee,Oooh excited to hear about it,29,6,10:09:36
Erica Yee,My nose is slightly stuffy...but otherwise ok,45,7,10:09:31
Ben Fickes,I had a dream about my dnd character,36,8,10:09:22
Ben Fickes,Dang sorry youâre so tired. Everything okay?,46,7,10:09:15
Erica Yee,It was fine. Even though I slept 9 hours (went to bed super early) I felt really sleepy so I took a half nap putting my head on the desk during our break lol,157,34,10:08:45
Erica Yee,Oh jk just saw second message haha,34,7,10:08:00
Ben Fickes,How was your class?,19,4,9:55:35
Ben Fickes,So I guess Iâm taking notes on my phone for this class,56,12,9:55:30
Ben Fickes,I pulled out my laptop to take notes and itâs out of power...,63,13,9:55:20
Erica Yee,Omg I closed our window by myself for the first time,52,11,20:59:38
Ben Fickes,Aw nice glad itâs so chill,28,6,20:24:15
Erica Yee,Think they got married this summer. Very cute,45,8,20:15:32
Erica Yee,A lot of it was the married couple who are singing bickering haha,65,13,20:15:04
Erica Yee,Rehearsal was soooo much more chill than last time lol,54,10,20:14:30
Erica Yee,On the bus back now,19,5,20:14:15
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,20:13:55
Ben Fickes,Also remind me to tell you about sermon discussion I heard,58,11,19:54:25
Ben Fickes,Had an interesting talk with a guy from moreville house Iâll tell you about,77,14,19:54:14
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,17:43:05
Ben Fickes,"Yeah haha. Okay slightly exaggerated, demiurge was actually good, just Pivotal was awk. Hope your rehearsal is good!",116,18,17:40:26
Erica Yee,I'm heading to Cambridge,24,4,17:39:33
Erica Yee,Good job tho :),15,4,17:39:27
Erica Yee,Was it people you knew?,23,5,17:39:21
Erica Yee,Oh noo haha,11,3,17:39:17
Ben Fickes,But I did it and now Iâm gonna have dinner with Lutheran group,64,13,17:37:48
Ben Fickes,Talked with Pivotal and demiurge and it was pretty awkward haha,63,11,17:37:31
Ben Fickes,"Cool, do you wanna meet up after your self defense class?",57,11,15:33:21
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry was agreeing with you,32,6,15:33:06
Erica Yee,Yeah that's what I was thinking too,35,7,15:32:00
Ben Fickes,I was thinking Iâd do Saturday. But I actually have a lot of work. And weâre hanging out Friday night so I might do 24 hours from when we start hanging out Friday,166,33,15:26:30
Erica Yee,Friday to Sat evening..?,24,4,15:25:27
Erica Yee,I'm trying to decide when to Sabbath this weekend,49,9,15:25:15
Erica Yee,Aw ok,5,2,14:55:36
Ben Fickes,But it'll be good,17,4,14:50:21
Ben Fickes,Sadly I have some work starting to accumulate. Got new capstone milestone and soft dev assignment today,103,17,14:50:17
Ben Fickes,Oh dang that's really nice!,27,5,14:49:58
Ben Fickes,Will do haha,12,3,14:49:52
Erica Yee,Class was supposed to be studio time for working on our projects but I finished hw (for this class) due next week instead,121,23,14:39:45
Erica Yee,"Lemme know how the co-op expo is, however brief haha",52,10,14:37:55
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good,16,3,14:35:21
Erica Yee,Barbara is cooking Friday but she said she should be done by 7ish,65,13,14:32:27
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,14:32:09
Ben Fickes,Feel like for this Friday we have enough to talk about and we were talking about cooking so I think thatâs probably enough without going out for a movie,154,29,14:27:09
Ben Fickes,Iâm fine either way,21,4,14:26:41
Erica Yee,Did you want to see it though?,30,7,14:25:23
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,14:25:18
Ben Fickes,No Joker Friday because Matt has plans he forgot about haha,59,11,14:20:39
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica :),15,3,14:20:22
Erica Yee,"Hm w
a polo shirt is good I think",33,9,13:51:24
Ben Fickes,Iâm going to the co op expo to say hi to people from Pivotal and demiurge. Do you think itâs okay that I donât dress up?,126,26,13:49:12
Ben Fickes,Your call haha,14,3,13:48:47
Ben Fickes,Oh nice,7,2,13:48:43
Erica Yee,That's what we transcribed,26,4,13:35:43
Erica Yee,Should I do it,14,4,13:35:29
Ben Fickes,Thatâs super interesting,26,3,13:33:58
Ben Fickes,God has given us a sign,23,6,13:33:46
Erica Yee,At the end we read the prayer aloud together in Latin and then the lights started flickering and shut off lol,109,21,13:26:07
Erica Yee,Yup there's a whole interdisciplinary project around it,55,8,13:23:58
Ben Fickes,Companion game for the prayer book?,35,6,13:22:43
Erica Yee,That draws you into a fictional backstory,41,7,13:16:59
Erica Yee,There's also a companion game that some cs/game majors made apparently that you have to email someone a secret code to join the discord for,139,25,13:16:47
Erica Yee,"Cuz there's a picture of the dragon on the inside of the front cover and it sounds cooler than ""Dominican order prayer book""",124,23,13:16:16
Erica Yee,"Oh shoot forgot about the class, but yeah",41,8,13:15:43
Ben Fickes,*book,5,1,13:12:08
Ben Fickes,And that does sound really cool! Why is it the dragon prayer group,66,13,13:12:05
Ben Fickes,So with your self defense we'd prob have to go at 9:45 right?,61,13,13:11:51
Ben Fickes,"6, 6:30, or 9:45",16,4,13:11:37
Ben Fickes,times are not great,19,4,13:11:19
Ben Fickes,"I'll talk to Matt, idk if anyone else can make it that he asked so I'll ask him if he still wants to go",103,24,13:11:15
Erica Yee,The only thing I brought to my group was recognizing the prayer we were transcribing came from 1 Peter lmao,107,20,13:04:41
Erica Yee,Event was really cool. I think you might've enjoyed it too actually. It was a workshop on transcribing Latin based on this random medieval manuscript northeastern has called the dragon prayer book,196,32,13:04:11
Erica Yee,I'm a bit scared but I would go if you do,41,11,12:37:56
Ben Fickes,Would you want to see Joker tomorrow? (Matt is asking if people want to go). No pressure because I think you said you didn't want to haha,137,27,11:29:10
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice, lemme know how it is",29,7,11:00:34
Erica Yee,Going to this library archive event that my English professor recommended cuz there's lunch,91,14,10:54:23
Erica Yee,Yeah I slept in again (not as much hah) so think I'm good,57,13,10:53:50
Ben Fickes,Are you feeling alright? After not sleeping a ton?,50,9,10:41:04
Ben Fickes,Haha very fair,14,3,10:40:55
Erica Yee,Eh for me I play so I DON'T have to do other things haha,56,14,10:34:50
Ben Fickes,But you can have the game running while you do something else entirely,70,13,10:29:25
Erica Yee,But it's the same speed!!,25,5,10:25:37
Ben Fickes,But yeah donât think Iâd really use it,42,8,10:24:00
Ben Fickes,But it is pretty standard for mobile games so Iâm sure people will appreciate it,82,15,10:23:53
Ben Fickes,I think the fact they have looting makes it less necessary,58,11,10:23:36
Erica Yee,I don't think I like it lol,27,7,10:20:34
Ben Fickes,Thatâs definitely new,23,3,10:20:26
Ben Fickes,Wait in SEGA heroes?,20,4,10:20:22
Erica Yee,Dude is the auto battle thing new,33,7,10:20:12
Erica Yee,A few short stories with only choice at the end,47,10,10:20:01
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm I see. So there would only be one decision and itâd be the end? Or I guess you could still have some choices, just much shorter overall story",148,29,10:19:00
Erica Yee,But idk which one I want to do more haha,40,10,9:26:18
Erica Yee,"But I couldn't sleep for a long time last night (probably cuz I slept in so much the night before lol) so I was thinking of other ideas. Like mini stories of different genres (mystery, horror) instead of one continuous story. For each you would have to go online to choose your ending (i.e. horror - pick which door you escape through). This would actually fit the usual zine format better because it's a collection of things rather than one story",447,81,9:26:04
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,9:23:14
Ben Fickes,Of course! Glad you got it done. Choose your own adventure?,59,11,0:15:52
Erica Yee,Thanks for letting me bounce ideas off you :),45,9,0:04:05
Erica Yee,Yay finished my proposal also due Friday,40,7,0:03:51
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,23:33:59
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs amazing! Good for them,36,6,23:32:57
Erica Yee,Also he and Katia are both have a bet that they won't drink this month and I am so proud,88,20,23:31:38
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Yeah I wonât,23,5,23:31:23
Erica Yee,Don't mention it yet please,27,5,23:31:09
Ben Fickes,Or should I wait until itâs for sure,38,8,23:31:06
Erica Yee,Nope,4,1,23:31:04
Erica Yee,He's iffy cuz the online reviews about it talk about less than ideal work environment,85,15,23:31:03
Ben Fickes,Is it official enough I can congratulate him,44,8,23:30:59
Ben Fickes,Holy cow thatâs amazing! Congrats to him! Is he gonna except,62,11,23:30:36
Erica Yee,"I will. Speaking of, Calvin's interviewers told him they're gonna make an offer even though he still is gonna speak with one more attorney",138,24,23:29:40
Ben Fickes,Wow nice haha. And haha well I think itâs a great idea,56,12,23:29:00
Erica Yee,"LOL I told her you were thinking about it and she was like ""oh this is just because I forgot to get a room""",107,24,23:28:21
Erica Yee,"Eh it's kinda hard to explain without experiencing it sorry. But direct quote from Angela: ""does God want me to minister to people I dislike""",141,25,23:27:34
Ben Fickes,Very random but please hold me to applying to somewhere this weekend,68,12,23:27:07
Ben Fickes,Know you were stressed haha,27,5,23:26:49
Ben Fickes,Aw Iâm sorry,14,3,23:26:43
Erica Yee,Sigh A's got pretty much destroyed,34,6,23:26:31
Ben Fickes,FWIW she has inspired me to possibly start having menâs group meet in my dorm,79,15,23:25:36
Ben Fickes,And yeah that sounds like a lot. Props to her though,52,11,23:25:10
Ben Fickes,Like what haha (you donât have to answer if you donât want to),66,13,23:24:57
Ben Fickes,Venting about Asians?,21,3,23:24:43
Erica Yee,She also usually works afternoons and evenings and has to commute by car which is super tiring,94,17,23:22:44
Erica Yee,But anyway it looks like Angela's gonna take it just every 2 weeks at a time because she doesn't have much motivation,117,22,23:22:23
Erica Yee,A lot of it was Vivian and Angela venting about Asians in general lol,69,14,23:21:54
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,23:21:37
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well Iâd love to listen if you ever wanna talk about it,65,13,23:19:05
Erica Yee,A lot of things haha. It was kinda all over the place. Our experiences with asianness/Asian Americanness growing up and at school. Racial rec at IV.,148,26,23:01:33
Erica Yee,Interesting,11,1,23:00:31
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,22:59:09
Ben Fickes,What did you talk about at Angelaâs?,38,7,22:58:00
Ben Fickes,Which was basically Habitica haha (not quite but I ended up talking to him a bit about it),90,18,22:57:50
Ben Fickes,We talked about an idea he had for an app,41,10,22:57:21
Erica Yee,And that's awesome! What did you talk about? (If you want to say),65,13,22:55:48
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,22:55:36
Ben Fickes,"And Mike just left, actually was really good talking with him",61,11,22:53:03
Ben Fickes,Me Jason and Joshua. We met in my dorm because we didnât wanna kick people out and it was just the three of us. Dan didnât join even though it was at our place ð,168,35,22:52:44
Erica Yee,Who was at yours?,17,4,21:11:26
Erica Yee,Yep. Angela really doesn't want to do this group ð,53,10,21:11:19
Ben Fickes,We just talked as well,22,5,21:09:57
Ben Fickes,Nothing to worry about haha. And nice! Was it just the three of you?,68,14,21:09:53
Erica Yee,Just finished with Angela and Vivian. We just talked for an hour and a half haha,80,16,21:00:13

Erica Yee,A bit tired but alright. Kitchen is seriously super messy so working on that rn. So thankful I did the thing due at 1:35 class last night haha,142,28,11:55:44
Ben Fickes,"Also I was thinking in bed about what you said about you feeling like you take more than you give (or something like that). I just wanted to say that you give a lot and I feel genuinely invested in by you and cared for by you. But beyond that, I think the important thing is that our relationship isnât a score or transactional. (This is going to seem super off topic but remind me to tell you about the hot wheels movie in person). And I actually worry sometimes about taking more from you than I give so Iâm glad thatâs hopefully not the case haha. You really are a blessing to me",588,114,11:50:22
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling?,20,4,11:47:22

Ben Fickes,Dang. To both haha. What about his profiles,43,8,21:19:44
Erica Yee,oh also he showed me his dating profiles and ...................................................,96,10,21:16:42
Erica Yee,but he not gonna do that,24,6,21:16:33
Erica Yee,half of tonight was trying to convince him to ask for a raise,61,13,21:16:30
Ben Fickes,Sorry haha. And I feel like he complains about a lot as if it is impossible for things to be different but obviously he has a choice about whether he says encouraging things or not,180,35,21:14:38
Erica Yee,"at one point he was talking about how he never has ""cheery or encouraging"" things to say to people. he just talks about his own unresolvable problems. i said something like ""well you can ask other people about themselves."" he then goes ""so erica how are you?"" i tell him a bit about stuff. and then he straight up says my life is boring LOLOL",342,65,21:11:22
Erica Yee,Eh I rolled my eyes in my head so far back I lost them,54,14,20:54:19
Erica Yee,Oooh we do that at my parents' church sometimes,47,9,20:53:44
Ben Fickes,Hope time with victor is good,29,6,20:43:27
Ben Fickes,"It was good, we did prayer stations. Good time to just pray",59,12,20:43:18

Ben Fickes,So youâre singing? How are you feeling about it,49,9,19:12:28
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,19:12:19
Erica Yee,I feel played with lol,22,5,18:37:19
Erica Yee,The BU girl vocalist who was on the worship team call last night stepped down,77,15,18:36:59
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,18:36:39
Erica Yee,Mhm,3,1,17:01:47
Ben Fickes,Honestly a little scared he brought it up. But glad you talked to him about it,78,16,16:19:45
Erica Yee,But he agreed and said he is wary too so guess that's good,58,13,15:46:45
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I was not that blunt,28,7,15:46:10
Ben Fickes,I have some thoughts but they basically boil down to that,57,11,15:38:35
Ben Fickes,What okay have fun haha,23,5,15:38:25
Erica Yee,suddenly have to decomission the old IV website lol,51,9,15:33:23
Erica Yee,Sorry gotta do a lot of stuff so might not respond that quickly,63,13,15:25:48
Erica Yee,I said I would be careful about interpreting things like that,61,11,15:25:36
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,15:25:23
Ben Fickes,Wow what are your thoughts on that?,35,7,15:20:04
Ben Fickes,Run was really good actually. But I was hungry haha and I did eat and now feel very content,91,19,15:19:47
Erica Yee,"From Calvin:
Sooo last night I prayed for God to give me a sign to trust in him, and then I had this weird dream where I met this girl and we really hit it off and everything, only weird thing is I think itâs this girl I matched with on hinge that I added on Snapchat last week",279,59,15:18:27
Erica Yee,Did you eat,11,3,15:18:15
Erica Yee,How was your run,16,4,15:18:07
Ben Fickes,But yes I would like to know what he sent you pleas,51,12,15:13:58
Ben Fickes,I was like âwhy did he send you thatâ,41,9,15:13:46
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,15:13:36
Erica Yee,Also I just got a sock podcast ad,33,8,14:50:13
Erica Yee,Would you like to know what Calvin just sent me,47,10,14:49:55
Ben Fickes,Maybe I couldâve saved it,27,5,14:49:01
Ben Fickes,I meant to send the sock snap before I ran,42,10,14:48:56
Ben Fickes,What a shame thatâs the trade off for us being together in the same place,75,15,14:48:44
Ben Fickes,Dang,4,1,14:48:22
Erica Yee,Dude we lost our snap hearts,28,6,13:53:08

Ben Fickes,Glad you were able to eat haha,30,7,13:18:39
Erica Yee,Also I was so focused I almost forgot to come back in time to ear lunch before class,84,18,13:12:55
Erica Yee,But i still needed to make everything bigger anyway or else the resolution would've been blurry,95,16,13:12:27
Erica Yee,"It was actually not my dimensions that were the problem lmao, it was the print settings",87,16,13:11:33
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,13:11:19
Ben Fickes,I saw you got it printed - congrats,35,8,13:09:59
Erica Yee,Also doing this on a big screen is life-changing haha,53,10,11:57:42
Erica Yee,Samee for my design class,25,5,11:57:35

Erica Yee,I messed up the dimensions so I need to redo stuff before I can try printing again,82,17,21:07:42
Erica Yee,Haha thanka,11,2,21:07:18
Ben Fickes,Guessing itâs not anything I can help with but if it is lemme know,68,14,21:04:05
Ben Fickes,No worries,10,2,21:03:54
Erica Yee,Having issues sorry,19,3,21:03:05
Ben Fickes,"Ooh it looked really good, canât wait to see it in print",58,12,20:42:22
Erica Yee,I'm gonna try to print my poster and Snell first,48,10,20:41:47
Ben Fickes,Yep! Whenever,13,2,20:40:11
Erica Yee,ok for me to come over in a bit?,32,9,20:39:53
Ben Fickes,Think Jason and I are gonna go back and talk,44,10,19:16:11
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,19:16:03
Erica Yee,this is the first one right?,28,6,19:14:47
Erica Yee,aww,3,1,19:14:20
Ben Fickes,So rn its just me and Jason at menâs group,44,10,19:11:26
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I guess next time,27,6,19:11:06
Erica Yee,you should've been like your dad in the call behind dan,55,11,19:03:19
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,17:55:07
Ben Fickes,I looked up artichoke and this is possible the longest gif I have ever seen,75,15,17:50:31
Ben Fickes,Yeah my place is good. And okeydokey!,37,7,17:49:18
Erica Yee,I'll let you know when I'm done,31,7,17:44:36
Erica Yee,Probably yours again if that's ok,33,6,17:44:29
Erica Yee,Sorta,5,1,17:44:13
Erica Yee,Nice me too!,12,3,17:44:11
Ben Fickes,Iâve actually gotten a lot done today,39,7,17:40:04
Ben Fickes,Yep!,4,1,17:39:20
Erica Yee,Are you still down to do work together for a bit around 9?,58,13,17:39:10
Erica Yee,Lol nice,8,2,17:38:42
Ben Fickes,"He mentioned hinge when I got there, Iâll tell you the (very short) story later",81,15,17:25:48
Ben Fickes,I get the feeling the photographer wasnât fully satisfied with it because he kept saying âoh letâs do one moreâ but oh well I donât have to use it,156,29,17:25:25
Ben Fickes,Ended up being taken outside haha,33,6,17:24:57
Ben Fickes,I did. I was the first one and we spent 10 minutes trying to find good lighting,79,17,17:24:51
Erica Yee,Did you get your headshot?,26,5,17:16:27
Erica Yee,That's a good point,19,4,17:16:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah I agree. At first I was worried about it rushing people into marriages (because if they werenât certain enough to marry as opposed to cohabitate is this creating pressure?). But the moveout payment makes me feel better about that,236,40,17:10:10
Erica Yee,It's hard to imaginehow churches other than mega ones could do it though,72,13,16:53:34
Erica Yee,"I think it's a really unique and practical idea for a church to ""practice what they preach"" you know?",101,19,16:53:20
Ben Fickes,What are your thoughts on it?,29,6,16:38:10
Ben Fickes,Ooh thank you for sharing that article,38,7,16:38:04
Erica Yee,if you have time i think this article is really fascinating but it's kinda long https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/september-web-only/megachurch-mass-wedding-cohabitation-pastor-bryan-carter.html,202,16,15:20:43
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Congrats to him again,30,6,15:16:10
Erica Yee,"From my dad: Boston cutoff announced, not as drastic as expected, I cd have run as slowly as 3:33:21 and gotten in (I ran 3:25:41), so about 16sec/mile slower (8:08 pace instead of 7:51).",187,34,15:14:37
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,14:56:44
Ben Fickes,And I think heâs a pretty good healer for survival mode,57,11,14:54:08
Ben Fickes,For sure! And nice haha. No pressure to get the characters I implemented. But glad you got him! Heâs very good against ebitan,127,23,14:53:50
Erica Yee,Finally unlocked Tom Johnson almost 3 months since you implemented him lol,74,12,14:53:13
Erica Yee,Oh that's great! I'd love to hear about it,42,9,14:47:06
Ben Fickes,Feel much better about game,27,5,13:37:02
Ben Fickes,Capstone meeting was really good,32,5,13:36:58
Ben Fickes,can't wait to hear it,21,5,13:36:48
Erica Yee,Awkward airpods story to tell you later cuz going to class,58,11,13:30:04
Erica Yee,Rippp,5,1,11:26:38
Ben Fickes,Dang,4,1,11:25:13
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,11:25:10
Erica Yee,YIKE,4,1,11:24:27
Erica Yee,oooh,4,1,11:24:13
Ben Fickes,He's a blue,11,3,11:18:49
Ben Fickes,Chuih,5,1,11:18:46
Ben Fickes,Oh there's a new character in SEGA Heroes,41,8,11:18:44
Ben Fickes,Now I'm even more excited,25,5,10:57:48
Ben Fickes,Yes please haha,15,3,10:57:42
Erica Yee,Can I tell you in person cuz there's facial expressions involved,64,11,10:57:23
Ben Fickes,Gotcha haha. What's the general plot again?,43,7,10:54:08
Erica Yee,Still deciding how I feel about it lol,38,8,10:53:51
Erica Yee,"Oh speaking of, I finished my book last night",45,9,10:53:46
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,10:53:36
Ben Fickes,"My prof just said ""it's fun to go to IKEA because you can watch all the newlywed couples fight""",95,19,10:50:13
Erica Yee,Happy to help :),16,4,10:48:26
Ben Fickes,Thank you again,15,3,10:43:29
Ben Fickes,But I think I am gonna use stackoverflow,40,8,10:43:25
Ben Fickes,Turns out ref doc is due tomorrow not today,43,9,10:43:10
Ben Fickes,I love it haha,14,4,10:43:01
Erica Yee,"Lolol when I search for ""reference document""",44,7,10:41:04
Ben Fickes,I certainly will,16,3,10:38:40
Erica Yee,Omg remind me to show you an email later,40,9,10:19:42
Ben Fickes,Glad heâs feeling better,26,4,9:45:55
Erica Yee,Oh that's when he woke up ok,28,7,9:28:16
Erica Yee,Wait it was at 830am? Now I'm worried lol,41,9,9:27:41
Erica Yee,"Wow got this from Victor: ""I feeeel better!!! Tyvm sleeping""",60,10,9:27:32
Erica Yee,HAHA YESS,9,2,9:26:34
Ben Fickes,I beat egg man with one minute left until he disappeared,56,11,0:14:41
Ben Fickes,See you then :),15,4,23:56:10
Erica Yee,"I'm gonna read until I get too sleepy or finish the book, see you tomorrow",74,15,23:55:54
Erica Yee,And yeah ofc,12,3,23:55:31
Erica Yee,Oh man ok,9,3,23:55:26
Ben Fickes,"Can we talk about something about my dad tomorrow that I didnât get a chance to talk to you about today? Nothing big, actually thought about it from missionary talk",166,30,23:54:37
Ben Fickes,I love getting to talk with you,31,7,23:54:02
Ben Fickes,I might try if heâs still there when I go to bed,50,12,23:53:38
Ben Fickes,We get late days so I guess weâre gonna use those,51,11,23:53:26
Erica Yee,Also thank you for staying for the talk tonight when when you weren't planning to,81,15,23:46:08
Erica Yee,"While you're dealing with real life problems, I tried to vanquish eggman but I think I'm giving up lol oh well",110,21,23:45:57
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,22:00:08
Erica Yee,Here,4,1,21:59:38
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,21:52:08
Ben Fickes,lemme know when you're here,27,5,21:50:45
Ben Fickes,okay haha,9,2,21:50:41
Erica Yee,"I'll come over, I don't want my roommates to overhear lol",57,11,21:50:34
Ben Fickes,"Either way is fine, whatever is better for you",46,9,21:46:28
Erica Yee,I can go over if there's better,31,7,21:44:18
Ben Fickes,No pressure though,18,3,21:40:32
Ben Fickes,"We can talk, Iâll just have my computer with me",49,10,21:40:13
Erica Yee,Also wait you have the project still?,37,7,21:39:39
Erica Yee,I kinda do want to talk about it but I know it's not going to do anything,73,17,21:39:31
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,21:38:58
Ben Fickes,So turns out Matt sent out a false alarm and RA meeting is probably not happening,81,16,21:36:42
Ben Fickes,So I gotta go for RA meeting but if you wanna talk about anything victor said I can meet up with you after. No pressure but want to offer,137,29,21:27:57
Ben Fickes,I actually heard the last one playing as background music at summit haha,72,13,18:02:48
Ben Fickes,Hope you can too. And which one? Also I listened to all the ones you sent,73,16,18:02:30
Erica Yee,i feel like the songs that are left don't really fit together but ok she knows better,85,17,18:00:45
Erica Yee,dang ritu took off one of the songs i liked,43,10,18:00:02
Erica Yee,"Thanks, hopefully I can make it to part of IV",45,10,17:26:07
Ben Fickes,"Iâm gonna cook dinner so in case I donât finish in time, hope your class is good (and short)",96,19,17:24:23
Erica Yee,yup,3,1,17:23:44
Erica Yee,which i guess counts,20,4,17:23:43
Erica Yee,ok he said he's gone over questions and answers in his head lol,63,13,17:23:39
Ben Fickes,Lemme know how it goes please if he tells you,45,10,17:22:12
Ben Fickes,I hope heâs exaggerating,26,4,17:22:01
Ben Fickes,What,4,1,17:21:51
Erica Yee,"omg calvin's first screening interview is in 10 mins. i asked how he feels. he says ""i haven't prepped per se"" ??!?!?!?!????!!!!",128,22,17:19:38
Erica Yee,lol eh i'll keep thinking,25,5,17:18:26
Ben Fickes,And yeah I agree this feels like all design,43,9,17:13:03
Ben Fickes,I think I like stackoverflow better than licensing but I am very impressed that you know so much about both,107,20,17:12:53
Ben Fickes,We need a ref by tomorrow I think but the actual paper isnât due until next Thursday and we can change at any point in the meantime,133,27,17:12:24
Erica Yee,"also another idea was licensing (like what you can pick on GitHub when you create a repo), and how to be more clear about what each means for you. but sounds so boring",167,33,17:11:49
Ben Fickes,"You are absolutely amazing, thank you so much",45,8,17:11:46
Erica Yee,i'll keep thinking about reference documents. when's this due?,62,9,17:11:05
Erica Yee,it's more design,16,3,17:10:51
Erica Yee,idk how this has to do with writing though...,45,9,17:10:47
Erica Yee,also the duplication system could use some work based on my experience? especially with different versions of languages,119,18,17:09:23
Erica Yee,might be helpful to skim,24,5,17:08:46
Erica Yee,https://blog.codinghorror.com/what-does-stack-overflow-want-to-be-when-it-grows-up/,83,1,17:08:43
Ben Fickes,"But thank you very much for your help, I might do that",54,12,17:05:01
Ben Fickes,why this has to do with anything I will ever need to know or am learning I have no idea,87,20,17:04:51
Ben Fickes,temporarily,11,1,17:04:28
Ben Fickes,also if you could hide responses,32,6,17:04:25
Ben Fickes,So you can see the question while reading the results without having to scroll back and forth,93,17,17:04:00
Ben Fickes,Oh it could be cool if the question was in one column and results in another,76,16,17:03:44
Ben Fickes,trying to think the fix I'd propose though,42,8,17:03:25
Ben Fickes,hmmmm that's not a bad idea,27,6,17:03:15
Erica Yee,do you any frustrations with the user interface of stack overflow?,66,11,17:01:20
Ben Fickes,for the science paper I mean,28,6,17:00:52
Ben Fickes,that's a really good example in general but don't know if it qualifies for relating to my discipline,100,18,17:00:28
Erica Yee,wow that gif was a total mistake,32,7,16:59:39
Erica Yee,cuz i use jupyter notebooks a lot and they are,46,10,16:59:30
Erica Yee,well this is the first thing i thought of but based on these further instructions don't think it fits https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/,194,20,16:59:02
Erica Yee,oh yike,7,2,16:58:43
Ben Fickes,Anyways you know a ton about tech so was wondering if you have any ideas (no pressure though),93,18,16:57:37
Ben Fickes,"But it can be ""cross-disciplinary"" so maybe I find some general thing that's somehow tech related and pitch that",112,19,16:57:14
Ben Fickes,Because it's software and easy to fix,37,7,16:56:52
Ben Fickes,And honestly I feel like problematic stuff doesn't stay around long in cs,73,13,16:56:44
Ben Fickes,or just a lack of it entirely,29,7,16:56:26
Ben Fickes,yeah,4,1,16:56:17
Erica Yee,so you need to find a problematic document and remake it?,57,11,16:56:07
Ben Fickes,so we need to find the problem and say why what is currently there is insufficient,82,16,16:55:25
Ben Fickes,"Your document should ideally address a specific problem or gap in knowledge faced by its specific audience. It should work carefully, cogently, precisely, and appealingly to fill that  
gap or solve that problem",211,33,16:55:01
Ben Fickes,sorry lemme re paste,20,4,16:54:51
Ben Fickes,"Your document should ideally address a specific problem or gap in knowledge faced by its specific audience. It should work carefully, cogently, precisely, and appealingly to fill that 
Akbari (Eng 3315 Unit 2 Assignment) 2  
 
 
gap or solve that problem",254,40,16:54:40
Ben Fickes,We're supposed to be ultimately making a reference document,59,9,16:54:35
Ben Fickes,oh nvm found it,15,4,16:54:25
Erica Yee,lol ofc,7,2,16:53:18
Ben Fickes,All the instructions were verbal,32,5,16:52:39
Ben Fickes,"I think I have to have some sort of improvement and criticism, even if someone has tried to solve it",100,20,16:52:30
Erica Yee,"does it have to be something that's ""solved"" or something you want to solve",75,14,16:51:39
Ben Fickes,But most of the issues can be solved via googling,49,10,16:50:58
Ben Fickes,So there are a couple improvements that could be made,53,10,16:50:50
Ben Fickes,They can be difficult to work with at times,43,9,16:49:56
Ben Fickes,"Same with man grep, man touch, etc",34,7,16:49:47
Ben Fickes,so man cat brings up an entry on what cat does,46,11,16:49:35
Erica Yee,wow probably what i need in my life,35,8,16:49:31
Ben Fickes,"man is a command that means manual, it tells you what different things in bash do",81,16,16:49:06
Erica Yee,what's a man page,17,4,16:48:44
Erica Yee,OHH ok i read your message wrong,32,7,16:48:39
Ben Fickes,But most of it is available online so to say it isn't searchable (which it is if you know the commands for it) isn't entirely accurate,134,26,16:47:54
Ben Fickes,Because it's just a wall of text,32,7,16:47:27
Ben Fickes,I thought about man pages,25,5,16:47:21
Ben Fickes,So I have to find something like that that relates to my discipline,67,13,16:47:06
Ben Fickes,Examples were that receipts are hard to read and someone suggested an alternate. And blood tests are lots of numbers and people suggested alternatives,150,24,16:46:55
Erica Yee,like a reference document of the problem or for the problem..?,62,11,16:46:10
Erica Yee,i don't really get the prompt,29,6,16:45:57
Erica Yee,firefly is a space western created by joss whedon (avengers dude),65,11,16:45:37
Ben Fickes,I was gonna say do you have any ideas,37,9,16:44:48
Ben Fickes,Dang that's upsetting,21,3,16:44:41
Ben Fickes,"on a completely different note: for interdisciplinary writing, I have to find an example of a problem with a reference document in/related to comp sci",150,25,16:44:37
Erica Yee,so never watching that,22,4,16:44:28
Erica Yee,there was a movie like 5 years ago with the main characters grown up (same actors) that had a pretty good ending. and then this summer they revived it for a fourth season adn apparently KILLED OFF THE GUY SHE'S LOVED FOR BASICALLY TEH WHOLE SERIES,247,46,16:44:23
Ben Fickes,"gotcha, thanks for sharing",26,4,16:43:41
Erica Yee,it's a bit dark tho so idk if i watched it again today if i would like it,73,18,16:42:35
Erica Yee,young kristen bell!,19,3,16:42:11
Erica Yee,veronica mars is about the titular high school girl who solves mysteries. her dad's a police detective,102,17,16:42:03
Ben Fickes,yeah,4,1,16:39:55
Erica Yee,like what are the about?,24,5,16:38:39
Ben Fickes,what are the other shows,24,5,16:36:38
Erica Yee,watched futurama somewhere from 1-2 years of college,52,8,16:36:24
Erica Yee,"the other 2 tv shows i've watched all the way through are veronica mars (3 season) and firefly (1 season), both in high school on sketchy sites",143,27,16:35:45
Erica Yee,i apparently only liked cancelled shows lol (and this one was cancelled twice),78,13,16:35:11
Erica Yee,yup,3,1,16:35:03
Ben Fickes,wow that's high praise,22,4,16:31:52

Erica Yee,yup,3,1,16:31:11

Erica Yee,ayy futurama <3,15,3,16:30:14
Ben Fickes,Not Jerry too...,16,3,16:29:18
Ben Fickes,He should get that checked out,30,6,16:28:57
Erica Yee,it's just compared to the force of his heartbeat,48,9,16:27:52
Ben Fickes,Why is his upper body so still,30,7,16:27:12
Ben Fickes,Oh I do know that one,21,6,16:15:01

Ben Fickes,any ones in particular?,23,4,15:43:13
Erica Yee,really like some of the songs that are new to me,48,11,15:38:11
Erica Yee,oh but then it helped when i stopped listening to podcasts while doing other stuff and started listening to the fall retreat playlist,133,23,15:37:59
Erica Yee,had an ok devo time but it felt more intellectual-y whereas i'm asking God to show Himself more emotionally to me rn,116,22,15:34:59
Erica Yee,but being slighty productive,28,4,15:34:01
Erica Yee,feeling very lethargic,22,3,15:33:48
Ben Fickes,Are you doing okay?,19,4,15:30:54
Erica Yee,i hope it's short,17,4,15:29:31
Erica Yee,thans,5,1,15:29:29
Ben Fickes,Hope itâs good,16,3,15:28:21
Erica Yee,yep,3,1,15:28:00
Ben Fickes,Do you have class tonight,25,5,15:26:38
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,15:26:28
Erica Yee,glad you're doing well,22,4,15:24:23
Erica Yee,yeah def,8,2,15:24:19
Ben Fickes,"Iâm pretty good. Not too different than a normal day, except I did take more time to think about it. I have thoughts but not really new thoughts if that makes sense",166,32,15:21:00
Ben Fickes,*though,7,1,15:20:15
Ben Fickes,I took my walk before networks yeah. Ended up being pretty short now,68,13,15:20:11
Erica Yee,how are you feeling? did you take the walk yet?,47,10,15:16:04
Ben Fickes,aw that's really really kind of her,35,7,15:11:41
Erica Yee,ah she sent me a card for you too but i've been checking for it and it's not here yet,85,20,15:09:50
Ben Fickes,And apparently she sent my mom a card,37,8,15:05:45
Ben Fickes,Oh your mom sent me a really nice message,41,9,15:05:38
Erica Yee,Ooh that's a good point,23,5,14:00:45
Ben Fickes,"Idk for sure, just a random thought",35,7,13:50:23
Ben Fickes,"One thought on your first point: maybe the ""will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you"" is an acknowledgment of how fragile we are and how subject to our surroundings we are. Like a ""we want to praise us, but we are weak and struggle to in these conditions - please help us""",297,58,13:50:16
Ben Fickes,Ooh thanks for sharing,22,4,13:48:27
Erica Yee,"And then ""show us your steadfast love, O Lord, and grant us your salvation"" -- pastor Adam talked about how God's wrath is intrinsic with His love, so how do I wrap my head around not just feeling that He loves me when things are going well. Also, good reminder to me Jesus is our ultimate salvation and I'm very thankful for that",330,63,13:23:49
Erica Yee,This reminds me of the hardening of hearts,42,8,13:21:55
Erica Yee,"""will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?"" -- does this imply that they couldn't rejoice in and worship Him while God's (active?) wrath was on them? Cuz we should rejoice in His blessings ofc, but He is also worthy of our praise no matter what",269,51,13:21:01
Erica Yee,Ok I was copying it down and now actually have a few thoughts lol,65,14,13:18:45
Ben Fickes,Anyways will ramble more in person sometime,43,7,13:15:48
Ben Fickes,"Because I honestly donât know. I feel like Iâm inclined to say no, and I think it can be justified with things like free will and God wanting no one to perish. But He does reward and punish in the Bible, so why wouldnât He today? (but also Job)",250,49,13:15:35
Ben Fickes,And I ask myself âdoes God reward the just and punish the wicked?â,70,13,13:14:27
Ben Fickes,I also thought about the anger comment,38,7,13:14:10
Erica Yee,Honestly don't have further thoughts rn but I'm just thinking and praying about it,82,14,13:14:08
Ben Fickes,Ohh that is super interesting,29,5,13:14:01
Erica Yee,Happened to be reading psalm 85 and thought this was interesting in light of the sermon,87,16,13:13:25
Ben Fickes,Yeah youâre right. I just always try to be aware of my own failings too,73,15,13:08:18
Erica Yee,True but also it's good to be skeptical and ok to be productively frustrated imo,80,15,12:57:32
Ben Fickes,Yeah. Though in complaining about arrogance I remind myself of the CS Lewis quote thatâs âyou can tell how proud you are based on how much it frustrates you in others.â Anyways thanks for listening though,210,36,12:54:20
Erica Yee,"Yeah I get that (about perceived arrogance). Especially sometimes when he dunks on highly educated  cantabrigians, who do probably make up a significant proportion of the congregation, but not everybody is like that! And he has multiple graduate degrees too lol",261,41,12:44:16
Erica Yee,Ah ok I think I went to that event too and honestly don't remember much but can definitely imagine that vibe,108,21,12:39:49
Ben Fickes,TRUE,4,1,12:39:41
Erica Yee,Well actually that was about reading scripture which isn't the same as listening to your fallible pastor,104,17,12:38:28
Ben Fickes,I can talk more about this in person but I think what often rubs me the wrong way is a perceived arrogance (not that Iâm correct in that or thatâs the right word). I contrast him with Larry in my head haha,209,42,12:38:21
Erica Yee,Wow you're too fast,19,4,12:37:22
Erica Yee,^before reading yours,21,3,12:37:19
Ben Fickes,"Idk if thatâs the same as what you said or not, sorry if Iâm trying to tie in something unrelated",101,20,12:37:14
Erica Yee,"On the other hand, isn't this exactly what he was talking about where our problems and culture shouldn't be the controlling lens or something..",143,24,12:37:10
Ben Fickes,"I think I know what youâre talking about. I have thoughts on what he said about porn (sorta related to what you said about sins, not really the snappiness part) Iâll tell you in person because it involves something I overheard him say later. And as to the snappiness, I remember going to something he did on campus about âdid Jesus really resurrectâ essentially. And I remember there was a lot of him dunking on atheist arguments, and obviously I donât agree with those, but I felt like if I were an atheist, I wouldnât feel like I was heard and Iâd be no closer to faith",585,107,12:36:55
Erica Yee,Idk of that makes sense and I don't have any specific examples off the top of my head rn,88,19,12:33:48
Erica Yee,"Actually pastor Adam's humor, well maybe not the right word exactly, but more like his ""snappiness"" sometimes has started bothering me more this semester. I know it's kinda his job to call out sins in the world and his congregation, and I did agree when he talked about not calling specific sins as the worst on Sunday, but sometimes his snappy judgments that are meant to convict us rub me the wrong way a bit",410,75,12:33:31
Ben Fickes,"Thanks Erica. Thatâs not weird at all haha, it really means a lot that you would know and think about stuff in my life enough to think about that. Thank you for sharing",170,33,12:32:32
Erica Yee,"Wow thanks for sharing. I hope this isn't weird but actually when he said that line in the sermon, I also thought of stuff you told me about your dad and living up to his expectations, and I clearly remember thinking ""but Ben definitely doesn't hate his dad; he loves him and has a pretty healthy (imo) perspective of how his dad influenced him growing up,"" as you say, in complex ways",385,72,12:29:53
Ben Fickes,"Anyways thanks for listening, just came to my mind and wanted to share",70,13,12:21:01
Ben Fickes,"Okay one thing that came to my mind from the sermon that also relates to my dad: pastor Adam said âa lot of the time, in Christian circles, we make our children our idols. We make them the center of our lives. But <something about it being not good> and they will one day hate you for it.â And I thought about my dad - I do think Josh and I were close to the center of his universe. And Iâm not saying thatâs good, and I certainly think children can be an idol, as he said. But I donât think I could ever hate my dad, even in knowing ways that his attention wasnât necessarily good. And I canât quite put words to it but when I heard him say things like that, it just put this picture of parents and children that revolves around angst and keeping track of wrongs. And I have felt that truthfully, but I think it really shifted after my dad died because I realized how dumb some things that bothered me were and how dumb it was that I couldnât talk to him about other things. And I think people do keep track of how their well-meaning parents wrong them so Iâm not saying itâs not legit but I think itâs an incredible luxury to be able to fault pick your parents who care because a lot of people donât have parents or parents who care. I still feel like I canât express what Iâm trying to but overall it just made me feel like the particular line about hate was almost threatening parents and also dismissed the complexity between parents and children",1479,280,12:20:44
Ben Fickes,"Thanks Erica. And yep, always happy to listen",45,8,11:45:38
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening,20,3,11:39:08
Erica Yee,He has stopped responding as usual after dropping bombshells but I'll let you know if anything else comes up,108,19,11:39:01
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,11:38:15
Ben Fickes,A couple that he knows? And dang. I wish I could talk to him but idk what to say that would get through,103,23,11:36:02
Erica Yee,Then I asked how he's feeling about kimchi if he's using apps and he said she deserved better then tried to backtrack (which means there's probably actually how he feels),170,30,11:34:46
Erica Yee,There was this couple whom he idealized as couple goals and he just saw the girl on bumble,90,18,11:33:19
Ben Fickes,"No itâs all good, thanks for sharing that. Do you want to talk about it? Or is there anything in particular, if youâre able to verbalize it?",144,27,11:26:31
Erica Yee,Sorry I know you have a lot on your mind and you don't have to respond to this but just wanted to say that I'm feeling a bit worried about Victor (more than usual). But this might be because I'm projecting how using the apps affected Calvin on him rather than based on things he's actually saying,296,57,11:20:07
Erica Yee,Aww ok sounds like a good plan,30,7,10:24:23
Ben Fickes,"I'm alright so far, but I feel like it's actually very hard to focus my thoughts on my dad. Like my mind keeps going to other things. So I figure that I should take time out to reflect today, rather than just going through the same homework rush as always, so instead of running today I'm going to go for a walk at some point to reflect",336,67,10:07:28
Ben Fickes,Glad you're feeling fine!,25,4,10:05:34
Erica Yee,How are you today btw? Sorry I didn't ask yet,45,10,10:04:43
Erica Yee,And feeling fine about it honestly,34,6,10:04:32
Erica Yee,"Well it wasn't actually that helpful unfortunately, but I do have some thoughts in general",90,15,10:04:04
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about that?,31,6,10:00:29
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice, would love to hear about it later",42,9,10:00:22
Erica Yee,"Oh speaking of, I'm at the gym and listening to a podcast on being disagreeable vs agreeable in leading worship to prep for fall retreat lmao",141,26,9:59:19
Erica Yee,/ us,4,2,9:58:18
Erica Yee,Lord help me,12,3,9:58:15
Ben Fickes,(I guess not that you didn't before),36,7,9:55:36
Ben Fickes,Now you have two fronts to deal with haha,41,9,9:55:28
Ben Fickes,And also I'm very sorry,23,5,9:55:13
Ben Fickes,Why,3,1,9:55:08
Ben Fickes,whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat,17,1,9:55:02
Erica Yee,I am not ready for this,23,6,9:54:29
Erica Yee,"But Victor just said he downloaded a ""crap ton of dating apps"" uhhhhhh ohhhhhhhh",80,14,9:54:00
Erica Yee,Sorry changing subject,22,3,9:53:27
Erica Yee,OMGOMGOMGOMG,12,1,9:53:22
Ben Fickes,Sorry youâre jittery haha hope it calms down,46,8,9:52:14
Ben Fickes,"Was it a good talk? And yeah I really wish you could meet him too, and I think about that every now and again. But at least I can tell you stories. And weâll both see him again someday",186,39,9:52:04
Erica Yee,I'm feeling alright but drank coffee during class and now feel jittery lol,74,13,9:50:55
Erica Yee,"Also ended up thinking about you and your dad a lot, wishing I could meet him",77,16,9:50:33
Erica Yee,"Idk, Sophie and I talked for a long time in the dark since we both went to bed at the same time",95,22,9:49:46
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Anything on your mind? And how are you feeling now?,60,12,9:00:59
Erica Yee,I was in bed then but couldn't sleep for awhile..,49,10,7:41:09
Erica Yee,Yay good job!!,14,3,7:40:52
Ben Fickes,We finished whatâs due Friday!,32,5,0:23:44
Ben Fickes,Also hope youâre sleeping well,32,5,0:13:01
Ben Fickes,"Sorry for the late reply, Iâve been working on networks with Jason and then two friends came by for help with homework. (Apparently I am being repaid with a Capri sun tomorrow). Hope your reading is going/went well",216,38,0:12:56
Erica Yee,"Sorry, on second thought I shouldn't complain",45,7,22:41:57
Erica Yee,Omg they're all on Trump whyyyyy,32,6,22:39:25
Erica Yee,Now time to do all the ethics readings,38,8,22:38:12
Erica Yee,Finished senior project stuff,29,4,22:38:06
Ben Fickes,I gotcha. Glad she trusts you though,36,7,22:35:22
Erica Yee,"She might talk to you, but in general she's super wary of ""church people""",73,14,22:27:32
Erica Yee,"I told her some of my thoughts, including stuff we've talked about, and she said it helped",90,17,22:27:08
Erica Yee,Playing sega heroes,19,3,22:26:51
Ben Fickes,If she wants to talk another time I would be happy to participate. But no pressure,82,16,22:22:56
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,22:22:31
Ben Fickes,ð what isnât max difficulty for you,40,7,22:22:25
Erica Yee,"I'm still working on my senior project thing (due tonight) but Sophie keeps asking me hard questions like ""what does it mean when people say God called them to something"" and I'm getting very distracted",202,35,22:22:09
Erica Yee,Cuz I put buying oat milk as a Max difficulty to-do,51,11,22:21:16
Erica Yee,Wow now I feel bad,18,5,22:20:52
Ben Fickes,I added it as a max difficulty habit on Habitica so thatâs the real incentive,79,15,22:13:40
Ben Fickes,At least thatâs what I tell myself,36,7,22:13:25
Ben Fickes,Actually think Iâm gonna start applying after fall retreat though,67,10,22:13:18
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,22:13:04
Erica Yee,ð good job,13,3,22:10:29
Ben Fickes,So that is the progress on job apps Iâve made haha,52,11,21:58:43
Ben Fickes,I made a spreadsheet titled âplaces to apply toâ,52,9,21:58:32
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,21:29:45
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well thatâs good you have that option,47,8,21:25:14
Erica Yee,It looks like we should be able to without fees if it's 2 weeks before the event,80,17,21:23:14
Erica Yee,Ohh that would make sense,25,5,21:22:44
Ben Fickes,Can you cancel?,15,3,21:18:21
Ben Fickes,I tried to stealth ask dan to see if it was him and he says he thinks it was chichi,83,20,21:18:16
Erica Yee,Uhhhhh don't think we can plan that big an event so soon??,58,12,21:15:28
Erica Yee,Someone booked afterhours for a worship night 10/20 and idk who did but this is not what agreed on lol,102,20,21:15:17

And ever since I was little my dad always told me that after I woke up from a nightmare, I can always remind myself that it was only a dream. And thatâs what I still do. But then I did that and had the realization that my dad really is gone and idk how to explain that feeling but itâs terrible",666,142,11:39:18

Ben Fickes,Also I ran now so I donât have to run after class,51,12,12:59:17
Ben Fickes,Idk if me and Jason talking will distract you,45,9,12:58:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah. Though if you wanna work separate thatâs okay too,57,10,12:58:46
Erica Yee,oh to work together?,20,4,12:56:34
Ben Fickes,Though initially (or at some pont) could we meet at my place? Some of the work Iâm gonna do is a group project with Jason,123,25,12:56:00
Ben Fickes,Sure,4,1,12:55:31
Erica Yee,could you bring 1.5 rice cups please,36,7,12:52:14
Erica Yee,that would actually be really helpful haha. cuz this is a one pot instant pot recipe so don't know how much water to use for brown rice,135,27,12:51:22
Ben Fickes,Dan has white rice I could probably take if you need that,57,12,12:48:37
Ben Fickes,I have brown rice,17,4,12:48:26
Erica Yee,Do you have rice? And if so what kind,37,9,12:46:27
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,11:46:13
Ben Fickes,"I do not have dinner plans, thank you!",38,8,11:37:52
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah if you don't have dinner plans, I'm planning on cooking",63,12,11:26:31
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,10:10:24
Ben Fickes,We and the other two three person groups have to meet with the prof after,73,15,10:08:41
Erica Yee,So are you guys staying a 3 person group,40,9,10:07:46
Erica Yee,ð¤·ââï¸,13,1,10:07:26
Ben Fickes,What haha that's strange,24,4,10:04:59
Ben Fickes,"Thanks for sharing all of that. Actually sounds very interesting, I'm curious to hear your thoughts later",105,17,10:04:52
Erica Yee,Wowowow I was using a machine for literally 2 mins and a girl asked me how much longer I was gonna take when there's so many other machines open,144,29,10:02:40
Erica Yee,Especially timely there's a global climate strike today leading up to the UN climate summit on Monday,101,17,10:02:00
Erica Yee,"It's a huge topic so I focused on a few angles: language (a major newspaper started using ""climate crisis"" instead of ""climate change""), the line between activism and journalism, audience news fatigue when covering an ongoing issue",231,37,10:01:27
Ben Fickes,Oh that's interesting. What did you talk about about it?,56,10,9:55:56
Erica Yee,Ethics of covering climate change. Dw I don't think I told you cuz I decided on it yesterday haha,97,19,9:55:37
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,9:55:12
Ben Fickes,Thatâs great! What was it on again? Sorry haha,48,9,9:52:27
Ben Fickes,Okay depending on when this class ends I might have to run after my second class. Iâll let you know,101,20,9:52:06
Erica Yee,Presentation went pretty well!,30,4,9:50:50
Erica Yee,I'm free whenever but am planning on doing a good amount of work,64,13,9:50:40
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,9:50:21
Ben Fickes,I have a bit of work to do though,33,9,9:22:57
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna shop and/or hang out later?,40,8,9:22:50
Ben Fickes,Jason told me about it and we tried some pics haha,50,11,9:01:21
Erica Yee,Oh I read a bit about it,24,7,7:48:51
Ben Fickes,Remind me to tell you about image net roulette,46,9,23:33:56
Erica Yee,Thankss,7,1,21:51:38
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs right!!! Hope it goes well,38,7,21:48:41
Erica Yee,Guess I should get lots of sleep before my presentation tmr,59,11,21:41:41
Erica Yee,Will do :),10,3,21:41:27
Ben Fickes,Oh good idea! Lemme know how it is (not necessarily tonight if you fall asleep haha),84,16,21:38:51
Ben Fickes,Wow you were very close,23,5,21:38:34
Erica Yee,Oooh maybe I'll start my book!,30,6,21:37:41
Erica Yee,Whereas I said I thought it was under the sink,46,10,21:37:14
Erica Yee,She says it's next to the sink,30,7,21:36:59
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well if itâs not sleepy tired maybe do something that helps you relax until you sleep? If you just wanna sleep I think thereâs nothing wrong with sleeping haha,171,30,21:35:17
Ben Fickes,No I meant call your sister haha,32,7,21:34:48
Erica Yee,I'm just feeling very tired,27,5,21:34:43
Erica Yee,Oh did you mean call Tiffany lolol,34,7,21:34:33
Erica Yee,"But she always forgets when I say ""lemme know..."" So i don't have high hopes",76,15,21:34:22
Erica Yee,I asked her to tell me where it is when she finds out,53,13,21:33:59
Ben Fickes,Are you feeling okay? We were up very late last night so even if you slept in that could be part of it,102,23,21:32:33
Ben Fickes,You should call her and ask,27,6,21:32:13
Erica Yee,Which doesn't make sense because I slept in,43,8,21:31:54
Erica Yee,I kinda want to just go to bed,30,8,21:31:31
Erica Yee,But now am very curious where it is,35,8,21:31:18
Erica Yee,I was wrong lol,15,4,21:31:13
Ben Fickes,Or trusts your memory on trashcan placement,43,7,21:29:16
Ben Fickes,ð sounds like someone doesnât know how to live without you,63,11,21:29:03
Erica Yee,My sister just called me to ask where Tiffany's trash can is..,62,12,21:25:34
Erica Yee,Nah it's all good,17,4,21:25:21
Ben Fickes,Sorry you didnât get to hang out though haha,46,9,21:19:49
Ben Fickes,Oh nice,7,2,21:19:42
Erica Yee,So even people who weren't rehearsing come,42,7,21:06:13
Erica Yee,Yeah every third Thursday it's worship team hangout,51,8,21:05:51
Ben Fickes,Haha nice. So are they still going?,35,7,21:02:40
Erica Yee,I'm on the 1 back. Left right before sharing testimony time lmao,64,12,21:02:24
Erica Yee,Oooh thanks for sharing,23,4,21:01:47
Ben Fickes,Anyways just interesting,24,3,20:58:54
Ben Fickes,Itâs also interesting because one of the people who comes is Hindu. And he said âI was sent to catholic school as a child and I donât see a huge difference between different faiths.â And he said things like âI thank Godâ and things like that but also heâs Hindu,275,50,20:58:49
Ben Fickes,We talked about service and what it means to be a faith community. It was interesting because some people said things like âI think the important part of faith is being in community with others.â Which I think is important but also thereâs God haha,254,45,20:57:48
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs wild haha. It was good! They had pizza haha (so Iâve had a lot of pizza today),92,19,20:56:53
Erica Yee,How was open table,18,4,20:53:21
Erica Yee,I also got to catch up with Erin whose roommate apparently knows my family but I don't know her,95,19,20:53:18
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,20:52:54
Ben Fickes,Oh dang sorry about that. And nice haha Iâm sure theyâre both happy to be able to play games with each other,112,22,20:51:11
Erica Yee,Lol Tiffany,11,2,20:49:06
Erica Yee,This was kinda a whole mess that I will tell you in person,58,13,20:48:49
Erica Yee,Yes but also idk if I can practice enough to get it up to her standards without a full kb,89,20,20:48:37
Ben Fickes,And I just saw the cosplay. Holy cow thatâs crazy,51,10,20:47:53
Ben Fickes,Are you feeling alright about it?,33,6,20:46:58
Erica Yee,With grace lol,14,3,20:46:17
Erica Yee,Omg my piano playing got picked apart so badly,46,9,20:46:11

Ben Fickes,Theyâre raffling off a ps4 to someone here haha,49,9,16:57:05
Erica Yee,And pizza after worship team rehearsal,38,6,16:41:12
Erica Yee,Lol there was pizza at the lunch speaker event I went to,56,12,16:41:04
Ben Fickes,Which is kinda unfortunate because I'm also getting free dinner at Open Table,77,13,16:38:35
Ben Fickes,They have pizza here though,27,5,16:38:20
Erica Yee,Ah yikes,8,2,16:37:02
Ben Fickes,And then hope they keep me after,32,7,16:36:02
Ben Fickes,So if I wanted to work for them I'd have to apply to their internship,69,15,16:35:55

Ben Fickes,No like with them,17,4,16:35:33
Erica Yee,At any company?,15,3,16:35:28
Erica Yee,Like an intern in general?,26,5,16:35:20
Ben Fickes,"Thanks! Was told by the recruiter that they take interns after graduation, but you really can't be hired for a full time position in tech until you've been an intern",165,30,16:31:01
Erica Yee,Hope it goes well :),20,5,16:10:00
Ben Fickes,Go figure haha,14,3,16:00:03

Ben Fickes,I just ate ice cream and played SEGA heroes because it was easier than the assignment I have due tomorrow,105,20,15:23:48
Erica Yee,I just finished an assignment due next Thursday instead of the one due tomorrow cuz it was easier,97,18,15:11:48
Erica Yee,Dang ok,7,2,15:11:29
Ben Fickes,Wow nice timing haha,20,4,14:27:42
Ben Fickes,"Professor inadvertently shot it down, because she liked World war 2 and wanted to combine it with our other ideas so she pitched necromancy x world war 2 and that was the basis of our brainstorming for the rest of class",219,41,14:27:29
Erica Yee,"OMG. I'm leading a discussion in ethics class tmr, and I sent my professor the article I want the class to read at the EXACT SAME TIME down to the minute as when he emailed me asking what was up. I'm so shook",208,43,13:57:13
Erica Yee,Today,5,1,13:20:59
Erica Yee,What did people think of your kid one,37,8,13:20:58
Erica Yee,Ohh sad,7,2,13:20:40
Ben Fickes,Repeat level got dropped because only I voted for it haha (but two other people said they thought it was good when we were discussing ideas?),141,26,13:12:53
Erica Yee,Can you do ww2 themed of your repeat level mechanic idea? Or is that not historically accurate,94,17,13:11:25
Erica Yee,Lol can tell your prof likes historical stuff,45,8,13:10:46
Ben Fickes,But I have no idea what the actual game is,42,10,13:08:40
Ben Fickes,"So when we discussed our idea with the prof, ww2 quickly became the focus",73,14,13:08:27
Ben Fickes,And he knows the prof likes ww2,31,7,13:08:06
Ben Fickes,One member just really wants it to be about World War II,56,12,13:07:56
Erica Yee,Imaginations scare*,19,2,13:06:29
Erica Yee,Your teammates' imagination scares me,37,5,13:06:21
Ben Fickes,But oh well,11,3,13:03:30
Ben Fickes,Just had game meeting. We really donât have a final idea. Honestly kinda scared Iâm not gonna like what we come up with,123,23,13:03:26

Ben Fickes,"We're talking about tech companies and my prof said ""like me on Facebook, hate me in real life"" and couldn't stop laughing at his own joke for a solid 30 seconds",161,31,11:07:43
Erica Yee,yay,3,1,10:33:09

Ben Fickes,you aren't giving me any options,32,6,15:12:31
Erica Yee,Did you talk to Josh already or did you already,47,10,15:11:14
Erica Yee,Only if someone would actually use it,37,7,15:10:56
Ben Fickes,I can hold onto it if you don't want it,39,10,15:09:59
Ben Fickes,nice haha,9,2,15:09:47
Erica Yee,My mom sent me another foam roller even tho I already have one (that I happened to use today)..,95,19,14:43:42

Erica Yee,IDK,3,1,13:15:28
Ben Fickes,Are you gonna do it?,20,5,12:56:40
Ben Fickes,Well this a wild turn,21,5,12:56:34
Erica Yee,........,8,1,12:55:59
Erica Yee,Ritu read the list wrong and already has a keyboardist and wants me to just do vocals,85,17,12:55:57
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,12:55:12
Ben Fickes,Haha ð wow maybe Paul is just very sarcastic and we never knew it,68,14,12:48:59
Erica Yee,"Omg I'm reading Romans 1 and the note on Paul's ""I long to see you"" is: ""letters often included affectionate expressions (presumably usually sincere)"" lolol",156,25,12:26:40
Erica Yee,So I waited haha,16,4,12:25:42
Erica Yee,Tmi but I went downstairs to poop in peace but someone was in the singular stall for the first time when I checked!,115,23,12:25:34
Ben Fickes,That sounds really awkward,26,4,12:21:41
Ben Fickes,Sorry about your snap haha,26,5,12:21:35
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,12:19:42
Ben Fickes,It was pretty good. Just reviewing drafts. Scared for how heâs gonna grade but I have until Friday midnight to revise,119,21,12:16:50
Ben Fickes,Hmmm good point,15,3,12:16:25
Erica Yee,How was class,13,3,12:16:14
Erica Yee,Lol not the same cuz they didn't know us before,47,10,12:15:56
Ben Fickes,Except they probably know because weâve held hands at IV,58,10,12:15:32
Ben Fickes,Maybe you can be the one to break it to new freshmen,52,12,12:15:21
Ben Fickes,âSo randomâ haha what a reaction,36,6,12:15:08
Erica Yee,"Danielle's apparently was ""whaaaa?! So random???""",49,6,12:11:46
Erica Yee,I just never got to see anyone's reaction haha,46,9,12:11:32
Erica Yee,Which is totally fine,21,4,12:11:23
Erica Yee,I have not,10,3,12:11:14
Ben Fickes,Wait have you really not been the one to tell any IV people?,60,13,12:08:04
Ben Fickes,Haha of course RenÃ©e,21,4,12:07:45
Erica Yee,"Whom""",5,1,12:06:49
Erica Yee,"But nope, she already knew from Renee",37,7,12:06:47
Erica Yee,"Before I was like ""ooh is this gonna be the first intervarsity person who I'm going to tell""",92,18,12:06:33
Ben Fickes,Haha I can picture it! I wonder sometimes how everyone heard about us haha,74,14,12:06:02
Erica Yee,Also Dani made a very hard pivot from talking about something else to asking about us lmao,90,17,12:05:16
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Hope you get to talk to her more then :),49,12,12:04:28
Erica Yee,She's gonna try to make it to women's dinner on Saturday,56,11,12:03:44
Erica Yee,"Andrea from Malaysia, BNS",25,4,12:03:34
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs so awesome! Iâm looking forward to hearing about the point and thatâs amazing you could talk with the freshman. Whatâs their name?,150,24,12:01:20
Erica Yee,So we talked to this freshman for like half an hour!!,53,11,12:00:27
Erica Yee,"Had such a wonderful talk with Dani!! Like 1.5 hours. At one point we were talking about what we didn't like about LG (she made a really good point I'll tell you later) and then the person sitting next to use goes ""excuse me sorry to interrupt but I heard you talking about intervarsity and I'm trying to find a Christian group""",328,62,11:59:57
Ben Fickes,Barely showered before class so did not shave today...,54,9,10:55:13
Ben Fickes,"Way to go haha, hope it's good",30,7,10:54:58
Erica Yee,What a tease,12,3,10:07:05
Erica Yee,But still made it haha (she's not here yet),43,9,10:06:58
Erica Yee,Slept through 2 alarms until half an hour before supposed to meet Danielle and had to shower,92,17,10:06:50
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today? I had a dream last night that I remember had both of us in it and I remember thinking âI should tell Erica about this dreamâ when I woke up but I canât remember it now...,201,41,9:57:50
Erica Yee,Ooh I never thought about it like that but I like it,52,12,9:28:51
Ben Fickes,You too Erica :) I really love spending time with you. And will hopefully have better words tomorrow but I actually love talking about helping Calvin because I feel like we are doing Gods work together (very dramatic haha and I donât mean to say Calvin is a means to an end). It just makes me happy to be helping (hopefully) someone with you,343,64,23:23:56
Erica Yee,Lol it's not that big,21,5,23:22:44

Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,13:44:02
Ben Fickes,I donât think she kept it up very long,40,9,13:37:10
Ben Fickes,It wasnât her research somehow she was working for somewhere,62,10,13:37:00
Ben Fickes,Idk,3,1,13:36:49
Erica Yee,wow did people?,15,3,13:34:59
Ben Fickes,Basically she matched with everyone possible on tinder and if they matched she sent something like âoh I donât wanna date but can you fill out this survey about why you use tinder for my researchâ,202,36,13:32:32
Ben Fickes,Ooh that would be great,23,5,13:31:45

Ben Fickes,Do you have time today or tomorrow to talk about the message to him? No worries if not,86,18,13:28:02
Erica Yee,all in the name of procrastinating from thinking of senior project ideas,72,12,13:27:55
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha, thank you for taking the time to look",54,11,13:25:35
Erica Yee,ok guess i didn't ask him if  he wanted to talk to you unless it was on snapchat or by phone which i kinda doubt. could've sworn i did ..but oh well,148,32,13:25:02
Ben Fickes,âFoodâ haha,15,2,13:14:56
Erica Yee,Haha omg what did you type in,29,7,13:14:43
Ben Fickes,Not as far as I can remember,28,7,13:13:58
Erica Yee,Is this even a line in the movie ð¤,37,9,13:13:34
Ben Fickes,I also eat many servings at once,32,7,13:11:13
Erica Yee,I did. The package says serves 6 but I probably use it in 2 x),62,15,13:03:23
Ben Fickes,Hope you enjoy your lunch haha,30,6,12:58:12
Erica Yee,Ah ok haha,10,3,12:55:19
Erica Yee,No to,5,2,12:55:02
Erica Yee,I have food I cooked but I really wanted dumplings (usually my backup when I have nothing left) so I cooked dumplings and this is such a good decision to,153,30,12:54:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah because he asked how to cut it and then asked if he could eat the skin and I said yes but he had to wash it,112,27,12:54:25
Erica Yee,He washed individual slices?!,29,4,12:53:44
Ben Fickes,Jason has already sliced the apples and is now struggling to remember which slices heâs washed,96,16,12:50:54
Ben Fickes,I did,5,2,12:50:28
Erica Yee,Blow his mind,13,3,12:49:57
Erica Yee,ð®ð®,8,1,12:49:54
Ben Fickes,Jason just asked me âcan you eat an apple with the skin on?â,64,13,12:48:19
Erica Yee,LOL OMG why do you know me so well,34,9,12:45:11
Ben Fickes,It is your choice,17,4,12:43:09
Ben Fickes,I actually wondered to myself if us talking about remembering would make you remember that weâre about to hit 8 months haha,125,22,12:42:53
Erica Yee,What if I said happy early 8 month anniversary today so I could beat you,72,15,12:41:54
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,12:41:33
Ben Fickes,Itâs clearly the important things that I remember,51,8,12:39:05
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,12:38:57
Erica Yee,Forgot about that but good memory,33,6,12:38:44
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,12:37:08
Erica Yee,LOL is that what Claire said,28,6,12:31:50
Ben Fickes,If heâs a boyfriend or boyperson,34,6,12:31:28
Ben Fickes,Just curious,12,2,12:31:16
Erica Yee,No idea,7,2,12:29:41
Ben Fickes,Are he and Mary dating or just âseeing each otherâ,54,10,12:27:35
Erica Yee,I've tried a bit but he doesn't really seem interested,54,10,12:25:54
Erica Yee,Ok I'm glad,11,3,12:25:45
Ben Fickes,Has Liam ever talked to any of you,34,8,12:23:41
Ben Fickes,Haha really though I donât think they mind you here,53,10,12:23:33
Erica Yee,Liam is over at our apartment and now I feel like your roommates whenever I'm over at yours haha,96,19,12:22:46
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,11:52:42
Erica Yee,Yeah def,8,2,11:48:16
Ben Fickes,Okay I finished a draft of my message to Calvin. I have one thing related to it Iâd like to talk to you about in person if you donât mind so is it okay if I wait to show you it and send it until I see you next?,214,49,11:41:23
Ben Fickes,"That was the same situation I think, good job",45,9,11:37:54
Erica Yee,(was that even the same situation...can't remember now),55,8,11:34:51
Erica Yee,"*insert brexit joke instead""",28,4,11:34:42
Erica Yee,LOLOL,5,1,11:34:07
Ben Fickes,But âpartner in crime is so clicheâ,39,7,11:28:56
Erica Yee,Lolol I would do the questionable thing with you,48,9,11:13:21
Ben Fickes,Idk if any of that even made remote sense,41,9,11:02:45
Ben Fickes,You can anonymously break a story about something I do but do so with questionable ethics and then present on that,114,21,11:02:38
Erica Yee,Gotta figure out on Thursday cuz it has to be a media ethics issue in the news,78,17,10:56:15
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,10:55:52
Ben Fickes,And I think that's smart about class - what's the presentation on?,66,12,10:53:19
Ben Fickes,"That's hilarious about the bus, thank you for sharing. I love hearing your random thoughts haha",95,16,10:53:06
Erica Yee,Just so I could get it over with early in the semester,54,12,10:52:45
Erica Yee,Anyway I also signed up to lead a little presentation in class on Friday,72,14,10:52:35
Erica Yee,Idk why I was thinking about this,33,7,10:51:57
Erica Yee,"Like whether I would sit with someone I'm ""comfortable"" with or if I should sit with someone new to talk to them",112,22,10:51:53
Erica Yee,"Lol this is super weird but when I still thought I was going on the bus, I was actually imagining who I would sit next to",121,26,10:50:33
Ben Fickes,Meanwhile I will be with my fellow plebians on the bus,54,11,10:30:30
Ben Fickes,Nice! Glad you get to get there early and practice,50,10,10:30:10
Erica Yee,YESS Dan can drive us early to retreat ð,43,9,10:29:35
Erica Yee,Of course,9,2,10:29:24
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica :) I appreciate all of your support,48,9,10:26:35
Erica Yee,Well you're definitely capable of getting it all done and even if things don't work out as expected I know you're gonna try hard,128,24,10:26:04
Ben Fickes,"Jk right now things aren't too bad, and I shouldn't expect them to be bad until I know they will be",99,21,10:18:15
Ben Fickes,in three months I'll be doing great haha,40,8,10:17:55
Erica Yee,"But yeah maybe a little bad for you, sorry :/",45,10,10:17:28
Erica Yee,Oh dang good for him,20,5,10:17:10
Ben Fickes,But I know he's smart,21,5,10:12:48
Ben Fickes,He's also graduating in December and has a job with them lined up so in hindsight idk if he's gonna try very hard,113,23,10:12:39
Ben Fickes,"I only know one of them, he's from Pivotal",42,9,10:12:16
Erica Yee,Do you like the other 2 in your group currently,47,10,10:11:54
Ben Fickes,Well it's out of our court now,30,7,10:05:37
Erica Yee,Oh wow..,8,2,10:05:06
Erica Yee,You really don't need to unless you really want to haha. It's honestly just sad,79,15,10:04:44
Ben Fickes,"He said ""does anyone know about how many people don't come to class?"" and no one answered ofc",93,18,10:04:32
Ben Fickes,So the prof had everyone raise their hands if they don't have a group and it's just two groups of three that don't have people,126,25,10:04:08
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. I'll look into the news story sometime to see if that helps me understand,81,15,10:03:44
Erica Yee,Ok it's pretty complicated. But the question I was answering at that point was sourcing and when/if off the record is enough to publish allegations,147,25,9:56:27
Ben Fickes,"I did not see the news story. And I have no idea, I do not notice whether or not you wear the same leggings",107,24,9:51:00
Erica Yee,Also I bet anything she has multiple of the same leggings,57,11,9:50:24
Erica Yee,Lol is this what guys notice,28,6,9:50:01
Erica Yee,"A: you know that girl --
B: which girl?
A: that pretty girl in my English class --
B: oh yes say no more
A: she wears the same leggings everyday. Like does she never take them off??",181,38,9:49:30
Erica Yee,Omg just overheard this convo between two guys,46,8,9:48:31
Erica Yee,Did you see the news about the new Brett kavanaugh story,56,11,9:47:20
Erica Yee,And now I think I agree with him. But it's ok,45,11,9:47:10
Ben Fickes,What was the topic,18,4,9:46:48
Erica Yee,One answer*,11,2,9:46:22
Erica Yee,At one point I felt that the Prof wanted me to say one and I didn't lol,71,17,9:46:09
Erica Yee,Really hard discussion topic,28,4,9:45:36
Erica Yee,It was good,11,3,9:45:32
Ben Fickes,How was class this morning?,27,5,9:41:32
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,9:36:11
Ben Fickes,I got partway through a message for Calvin last night. Will work on it more later,81,16,9:07:02
Ben Fickes,Honestly I didnât check I just threw it in the freezer and went for a run,75,16,9:06:43
Erica Yee,Did the frozen stuff make your backpack wet?,44,8,8:59:35
Erica Yee,I was thinking about texting you last night about it haha,57,11,8:59:18
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,8:58:56
Ben Fickes,Just remembered to take my food out of my backpack,50,10,8:15:39

Ben Fickes,I need to work so that would be good,36,9,20:12:33
Erica Yee,But no pressure ofc,19,4,20:12:18
Erica Yee,I'm gonna work for the next 2 hourish if you also want to,57,13,20:12:14
Erica Yee,Leaving now,11,2,20:12:02
Ben Fickes,Amy is here and I have a funny story to tell you,48,12,19:51:25
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good :),19,4,19:51:13
Erica Yee,"Oh sorry didn't see your q, will tell you in person",51,11,19:46:31
Erica Yee,Think I'm gonna learn a lot,27,6,19:13:37
Ben Fickes,What is it?,11,3,19:13:36

Ben Fickes,I can check the calendar haha,29,6,18:02:45
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! What time does your class end?,47,9,18:02:39
Erica Yee,And wow surprising but yay!,27,5,17:03:43
Erica Yee,Ok do you have time to stop by tonight?,39,9,17:03:27
Ben Fickes,Sorry had to go mid message but deadline got extended for groups,64,12,17:01:30
Ben Fickes,Of course!,10,2,17:01:19
Erica Yee,Cool can I give you a few please?,33,8,16:49:05
Ben Fickes,I do,4,2,16:26:33
Erica Yee,Do you eat bananas,18,4,16:17:07
Erica Yee,Yah np,6,2,15:13:27
Ben Fickes,"That sounds good to me, thank you :)",36,8,15:07:14
Erica Yee,Ooh ok. Maybe the Japanese fried rice,37,7,15:02:27
Ben Fickes,If you donât mind,19,4,14:59:41
Ben Fickes,Could you get me a frozen meal you recommend thatâs not too unhealthy,71,13,14:59:38
Ben Fickes,Hmmm honestly did not plan out my meals well so honestly yeah but idk what,74,15,14:59:24
Erica Yee,I'm going to trader Joe's. Do you want anything?,48,9,14:58:59
Erica Yee,Yup tonight,11,2,14:58:45
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Is that the Monday night class?,42,8,14:58:03
Erica Yee,"Speaking of last names, my design Prof sent an email to everyone in the class and by the emails I think there's so many Chinese people in this class lolol",154,30,14:56:31
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,14:55:33
Ben Fickes,Hovey,5,1,14:53:29
Erica Yee,What's your mom's,17,3,14:51:54
Erica Yee,Omg hahaha,10,2,14:51:52
Ben Fickes,I only know that because of recommended friends on FB haha,58,11,14:51:18
Erica Yee,Yep! Wow good job,17,4,14:47:51
Ben Fickes,Isnât Wong your moms maiden name?,35,6,14:46:54
Ben Fickes,I did not read it in that voice but did now haha,48,12,14:46:42
Erica Yee,Also did not know her last name is Wong haha,44,10,14:46:12
Erica Yee,I feel like she only saw us sitting on the couch or something,61,13,14:46:05
Erica Yee,Omg lol I read it in her screaming voice,40,9,14:45:25
Ben Fickes,"On a brighter note, Amy says she thinks you and I are very cute together",72,15,14:44:01
Ben Fickes,If I donât have a full group by after volunteering I might ask to leave my group to join a group of three. Which feels bad but what other choice do I have,156,33,14:43:46
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, I hope so",17,4,14:43:09
Erica Yee,Hope volunteering is good and can maybe take your mind off it for a bit?,72,15,14:42:54
Erica Yee,?!! That is such a bad policy,29,7,14:42:25
Ben Fickes,"Thanks. Honestly feeling pretty annoyed still (a little at myself for not replying when I saw the comment, also at the professor for endorsing that answer and giving no help or guidance). I want to find a group so the professor knows Iâm not grade grubbing and then make a post explaining why I think people not in groups should be given more time and why there are flaws in his system (for example, if one person neglects to do this assignment, three others will automatically fail it)",488,88,13:31:28
Erica Yee,Please lemme know what happens,30,5,12:29:16
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,12:22:59
Erica Yee,Oh no I'm sorry â¹ï¸,22,5,12:22:23
Ben Fickes,So without knowing whoâs in the class we have to find a fourth person by midnight,83,16,12:20:51
Ben Fickes,Someone replied last night while you and victor were over to join and I stupidly waited until this morning to respond. He since joined another group and now weâre one short again,180,32,12:20:36
Ben Fickes,Our group of 5 got rejected so we split into 3 and 2,52,13,12:19:59
Erica Yee,So what's happening to yours,28,5,12:17:55
Erica Yee,Omggggg what the,16,3,12:17:41
Ben Fickes,Wow a student was super rude and the prof endorsed it...,56,11,11:50:25
Ben Fickes,Do you think he wanted us to notice something?,46,9,11:39:32
Ben Fickes,I mean he looked kinda out of it at dinner but other than that I didnât really notice,87,18,11:39:32
Erica Yee,I asked him if there was any reason why,39,9,10:25:40
Erica Yee,I looked at a mirror last night and i realized how dazed i must have looked like all night,90,19,10:25:28
Erica Yee,Victor said he went to sleep right after sending that message last night and then said:,87,16,10:25:24
Erica Yee,Feeling pretty good so far,26,5,10:24:38
Ben Fickes,How are you doing? Feeling and with everything haha,51,9,10:15:34
Ben Fickes,Same haha. And yeah I remember that too haha,44,9,10:15:25
Erica Yee,Thanks. I remember you offering to talk with him when we were in New York too,77,16,10:06:17
Erica Yee,Was not planning on sleeping in this much but it felt good,58,12,10:05:36
Ben Fickes,I can tell you more in person but I prayed and felt like I should at least offer,80,18,0:49:21
Ben Fickes,I know itâs weird because he doesnât really know me,55,10,0:49:08
Ben Fickes,Okay will tell you more in person but I prayed for Calvin and victor. And idk if it would be helpful but if Calvin ever wants to talk I can,139,30,0:48:59
Ben Fickes,"Night, hope you sleep well :)",29,6,0:39:38
Erica Yee,Gnight,6,1,0:39:19
Erica Yee,Actually who knows what I'm trying to say at this point,55,11,0:39:15
Erica Yee,Yeah that's what I'm trying to say!,35,7,0:39:06
Ben Fickes,"But I also I feel that I respected and learned from you before we started dating, just much differently and probably to a lesser extent (since I knew you less)",159,30,0:37:07
Ben Fickes,I also feel that,16,4,0:36:34
Ben Fickes,"Ah I see, thanks for the clarification",38,7,0:36:30
Erica Yee,"Yes, like how I've grown in our relationship is not just the same as what I learned/grew from you while we were friends",119,23,0:35:42
Ben Fickes,"Like youâve grown in our relationship? But I hope it is also helping in faith somehow, or at least not hindering it",117,22,0:33:46
Ben Fickes,Like dating me is different than being my friend? Iâm glad haha. Jk I know thatâs not exactly what you meant,112,21,0:33:12
Erica Yee,Like the dating part is different/special,41,6,0:32:39
Erica Yee,If that makes sense lol,23,5,0:32:22
Erica Yee,Well. What I said is true but I meant in dating I've grown more and in different ways too,89,19,0:32:09
Erica Yee,Actually I think I phrased it wrong,35,7,0:30:44
Ben Fickes,"Please remind me to tell you later because I think it is important. And you too also haha, I will tell you what I told Dan. And nice haha glad youâre nice and warm",165,34,0:30:10
Erica Yee,Also it's not cold at all lol,29,7,0:29:45
Erica Yee,Thank you :) I definitely have as well from you. Even before we were dating honestly,84,16,0:29:24
Erica Yee,Oh you did tell me that he asked but said you'd tell me in person later haha,76,17,0:28:43
Erica Yee,Just got back (after using first floor restroom),48,8,0:28:14
Ben Fickes,"Idk if I told you this but dan asked me how our relationship has helped my faith. And I wanna tell you in person but I just wanna say, at least on my end, I feel like Iâve been able to grow closer to God in knowing you",220,48,0:27:46

Erica Yee,Just so you don't have to walk all the way over here just to backtrack,70,15,16:55:38
Erica Yee,Snapping you,12,2,16:55:05
Ben Fickes,Is that kariotis,16,3,16:50:33
Ben Fickes,Where is that haha,18,4,16:50:29
Ben Fickes,Sure,4,1,16:50:15
Erica Yee,Do you wanna meet at the law school steps at 645?,49,11,16:49:23
Erica Yee,Yup I'm asking him and Parker,29,6,16:48:43
Ben Fickes,Well dan is doing it I think? and heâs on co op so maybe talk to him?,71,17,16:46:46
Erica Yee,I kinda really wanna do it since I think I'm stepping back from playing for IV events (cuz others have shown interest),118,22,16:45:55
Erica Yee,Yep. Seems pretty mandatory cuz the other scheduled practices are a lot shorter,79,13,16:44:57
Ben Fickes,"Is that for practicing? Could you still do it and miss practice? Not to pressure you into it, itâs totally your call and youâre not obligated to, but if thatâs whatâs holding you back",191,34,16:43:39
Ben Fickes,Never take the name of Toah in vain,35,8,16:42:57
Erica Yee,Toah nipi* LOL autocorrect,26,4,16:42:37
Erica Yee,I got invited to do worship for fall retreat but idk how I could get to gosh nipi by 4pm,88,20,16:42:30

Erica Yee,What are you gonna do?,22,5,16:21:01
Ben Fickes,Or I guess you could have the dumplings or something too,56,11,16:19:15
Ben Fickes,If victor wants something too small for you for dinner lemme know if you want a sandwich,88,17,16:19:05
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I thought that would be her reaction,46,9,16:07:24

Ben Fickes,Also idk if barbs saw but her nemesis Manning was at bfig,57,12,15:48:07
Ben Fickes,I actually saw the sign for that and thought âI do not feel interested in that gameâ,88,17,15:47:52
Erica Yee,Omg Barbara just told me about this tabletop game they played at bfig called the cheaters. You're caught at the house of a woman whose bf cheated and you have to explain what you're doing with different sex toys and frame others at the same time....,249,46,15:35:59
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,15:33:47
Ben Fickes,And nice haha Iâm just starting work ð¬,43,8,15:28:42
Ben Fickes,I told him not too far because of your foot. I know youâre fine walking but I know if we walk super far weâre gonna get started super late so I figure itâs a convenient excuse,181,36,15:28:31
Ben Fickes,He will get back to me in an hour and how long am I willing to walk,67,17,15:27:52
Erica Yee,Barbara just came home and my productivity has dropped to 0,59,11,15:27:48
Erica Yee,What did he think about wollies,31,6,15:27:36
Ben Fickes,Victors reply was that he just had tasty burger,47,9,15:24:32
Erica Yee,Ooh yeah!,9,2,15:24:08
Ben Fickes,Also suggested grabbing sandwiches from wollies to eat here since thatâs quick,80,12,15:17:01
Ben Fickes,Okay I suggested that to him haha,33,7,15:16:47
Erica Yee,No but thinking of where he would actually go.... tasty burger maybe?,69,12,15:14:34
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,15:14:30
Erica Yee,Wasn't he the one who wanted to come early lol,46,10,15:14:08
Ben Fickes,And do you have preference for what we eat,42,9,15:13:45
Ben Fickes,He says maybe 7,15,4,15:13:37
Erica Yee,The usual,9,2,15:12:15
Ben Fickes,Victor has been âactive nowâ for the last twenty minutes but still no word haha,83,15,15:06:27
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,15:06:01
Erica Yee,But it's fine,13,3,15:05:45
Erica Yee,Lol I think you could def go if you wanted. For me it's more like I should support apida,88,19,15:05:36
Ben Fickes,No worries! Donât think you have to stop by I was just trying to suggest a solution,85,17,15:05:09
Erica Yee,I already told Vivian I could help sign in people if necessary so..,67,13,15:05:00
Erica Yee,Sorry got distracted talking to Sophie,38,6,15:04:36
Ben Fickes,And yeah Iâm not Asian so wasnât sure if it was intended for me either haha,79,16,15:04:32
Erica Yee,"Omg that does help tho, thanks. I don't feel as bad now",55,12,15:04:30
Ben Fickes,Could you stop by briefly maybe?,32,6,15:04:17
Erica Yee,And I'm Asian lol,17,4,15:03:23
Erica Yee,Me either but I feel bad cuz it's in willis,43,10,15:03:21
Ben Fickes,"Also in case it affects your judgement one way or another, Angela said about 30 people have rsvp-Ed",99,18,15:01:45
Ben Fickes,I donât think I can because of work,37,8,15:01:22
Ben Fickes,"I asked victor if 6:30 works, he hasnât replied",49,9,15:01:08
Erica Yee,Trying to decide if I should go to apida's NSO event..,54,11,14:58:54
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,14:53:22
Ben Fickes,Sure,4,1,14:47:41
Erica Yee,Let's do earlier if that's ok,29,6,14:44:37
Ben Fickes,Should I ask him if he wants to eat before 7:30 or we just eat then?,68,16,14:43:32
Ben Fickes,And no problem!,15,3,14:43:16
Ben Fickes,But Iâm guessing victor wonât want that,43,7,14:43:11
Ben Fickes,"I went to the store, so I have bagged salad and ingredients for quesadillas",75,14,14:43:02

Ben Fickes,Oh no,5,2,15:33:29
Erica Yee,"Dw, I also have a Calvin rant ready",35,8,15:33:14
Ben Fickes,"Will complain during breaks in the debate, I'm sure haha",56,10,15:32:28
Ben Fickes,Well thank you for that :) I also think that and I'd much rather invest in just one thing a lot,95,21,15:32:16
Erica Yee,"Even though you say that about yourself, I feel like you're going put in substantial investment into whatever you're assigned",125,20,15:31:34
Erica Yee,Oh dang,7,2,15:30:27
Ben Fickes,There are only two teams that exist currently (one of which is mine) and everyone else is struggling for resources in some regard,129,23,15:29:19
Ben Fickes,Apparently this class as a whole is a dumpster fire,51,10,15:28:49
Ben Fickes,But honestly only because I don't envision it taking much time. And it probably should so... same problem,105,18,15:28:36
Ben Fickes,I put myself as programmer/writer and I probably wouldn't mind extra writing,76,12,15:28:04
Ben Fickes,I have no idea,14,4,15:27:32
Erica Yee,How is that fair,16,4,15:26:45
Erica Yee,ð±ð±ð±,12,1,15:26:41
Ben Fickes,"Wow will probably complain about this in person but the professor for capstone said ""some people may have to work on multiple projects"" and apparently my name came up. So really hoping I don't have to work on two games in addition to everything else...",252,45,15:20:41
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,14:53:09
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Not yet, I'm going to in an hourish",43,9,14:52:09

Erica Yee,Ooh so you don't have capstone class at regular time anymore today?,67,12,10:38:58
Erica Yee,But idk why it's uneven,23,5,10:38:43
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,10:38:38
Ben Fickes,"I'm good. Went in to game capstone early for a meeting so didn't get to run yet, but on the bright side, after writing I'm free for the whole day now",149,31,10:37:06
Ben Fickes,"Is yesterday when the machine wrecked you? And gotcha, I'm glad you're excited!",79,13,10:36:31
Erica Yee,How are you?,12,3,10:28:52
Erica Yee,"Listened to a podcast to prep for the debate which reminded me how interesting politics can be, so more excited about debate tonight haha (I've been avoiding political news recently)",182,30,10:25:21
Erica Yee,I'm good. My left butt is so sore so decided not to go to the gym,65,16,10:24:21
Erica Yee,Maybe it's,10,2,10:23:50
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today,23,5,10:22:17
Ben Fickes,I feel like thereâs a new mechanic in 4 because the box is super fat but idk what it is,89,20,10:22:14
Erica Yee,LOL idk even know what that sounds like but good ð,53,11,9:31:17
Erica Yee,Ooh yay! Now I feel like 3 lulls us into a false sense of complacency and then 4 is gonna completely destroy us,111,23,9:30:55
Ben Fickes,"Alright, hope you rest well :)",30,6,0:01:12
Ben Fickes,Also also when I was putting away the game I said something small like âohâ but I said it exactly the way you usually say it. So I guess this is âreciprocationâ for me influencing your laugh haha,203,38,0:01:04
Ben Fickes,Also Jason came so he knows how to play the game,48,11,0:00:13
Ben Fickes,Board game night was really good! We destroyed book 3. I was about to say âIâll tell you about it when we talk on the phone nextâ but remembered I can tell you tomorrow haha. John (the friend whose place I was at) really liked the game and I told him you liked it and we may call upon him when we challenge book 4 if we need another player,345,70,0:00:04
Ben Fickes,"Haha thatâs hilarious, thank you for sharing! Please have me over sometime when sheâs working so I can hear",111,19,23:58:51
Erica Yee,"Going to bed but hope game night was good! I did work with Viv for a while, which entailed her trying to imitate cartoon character voices in preparation for her voiceover class, which was hilarious (she's gonna do Roz from monsters Inc)",236,42,22:56:14

Erica Yee,i don't think i invested in destiny enough to optimize it's gameplay,68,12,12:04:38
Ben Fickes,And I think the skills are much more complex which I like,57,12,12:02:01
Ben Fickes,But I like the gun stats of b2 better,37,9,12:01:41
Ben Fickes,I feel better at destiny,24,5,12:01:29
Ben Fickes,destiny is FPS,14,3,12:01:12
Erica Yee,"wait actually can't remember, is destiny FPS or 3PS?",52,9,12:01:04
Ben Fickes,I feel like I don't have to ask but are you gonna get it?,57,14,12:00:59
Erica Yee,what do you think of shooting mechanics/gunplay in b2 vs. destiny2? since those are the two main FPS you've played,114,20,12:00:54
Erica Yee,"Borderlands 3 follows four new Vault Hunters as they work for Lilith, now commander of the Crimson Raiders, who is fighting against a cult led by siblings Tyreen and Troy, both Sirens withâ¦interesting powers. Theyâve figured out that the two of them can control the roaming bandits of Pandora by absorbing them into a cult called the Children of the Vault. They, and we, are on a quest to find the various vaults that were shown on other planets at the end of Borderlands 2 to unlock their ultimate power.",509,90,11:59:09
Erica Yee,ok paul gave it 9/10 but his review didn't feel that high lol,61,13,11:58:49
Ben Fickes,wait is that part of it,23,6,11:57:03
Erica Yee,omg wait i do not want to work for lilith,41,10,11:56:22
Erica Yee,"i like paul tassi @ forbes, had a lot of same opinions of him about AC odyssey",78,17,11:56:05
Ben Fickes,"Haha PC Gamer was the one I happened to read, guess the others rate it better",77,16,11:55:58
Ben Fickes,I think my version will be less creepy hopefully haha,53,10,11:55:09
Erica Yee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/d1s847/borderlands_3_review_thread/,81,1,11:54:57
Erica Yee,i already have nightmares,25,4,11:54:49
Ben Fickes,I donât think itâs out but I think itâs out early for reviewers,69,13,11:53:20
Ben Fickes,"1. Indie horror game: The driver takes a back-road shortcut at night back home while listening to radio when the signal acts weird, and hears a creepy eerie sound interrupting the radio. Suddenly, the driver accidentally runs a mother and her child off the road before crashing. He/she wakes up injured, looks back at the road and they are no longer there. He/she than exits from the inoperable car 
- Forest layout is a maze which has strange carvings on some trees, doors and walls 
- Blood trails 
- Echoing creepy sounds (baby cries) 
- Trees change shapes becoming more creature like as the game progress 
- shrieking creatures with poor vision but can track by sound",672,117,11:53:06
Erica Yee,oooh didn't know it was out,27,6,11:52:46
Ben Fickes,Lemme copy it,13,3,11:52:34
Ben Fickes,I think so,10,3,11:52:31
Ben Fickes,I think it got 63%,18,5,11:52:28
Erica Yee,also is that her name,21,5,11:52:25
Erica Yee,what was ilayda's original idea,31,5,11:52:19
Ben Fickes,Apparently it's okay,20,3,11:52:18
Ben Fickes,oh unrelated to anything but I read a borderlands 3 review,58,11,11:52:13
Erica Yee,a hok,5,2,11:51:16
Ben Fickes,"One group member likes it, others have not responded. Idk two group members seem to have given up on us all being in the same group and formed a new one haha. So idk",165,34,11:48:56
Erica Yee,/ are you staying in teh same gruop,35,8,11:45:25
Erica Yee,what does your group think,26,5,11:45:13
Erica Yee,ooh that sounds cool. especially the boss styles,48,8,11:44:40
Ben Fickes,^^my idea,9,2,11:38:27
Ben Fickes,"Okay I had an idea for a version of @Ilayda HancÄ±âs first idea (really just the plot, we could tie in other mechanics). It could be that youâre driving at night near the woods and suddenly a child darts in front of you, but, instead of the child being hurt, the resulting collision flips your car and flings you from the vehicle, leaving the child unharmed and you unconscious. Turns out the child has supernatural/magical abilities (why they are unharmed) and transport you (either physically or mentally) into a forest/maze/whatever of their creation. The child was abandoned out of fear for their magic and has projected their negative emotions into actual entities that could be the bosses. (The emotion could reflect the bossâs style - Loneliness punishes you for getting too close, Fear runs away). Anyways by confronting these you help the child and they regain control of themselves and let you go",912,153,11:38:21
Erica Yee,Ooh ok!,7,2,10:53:37
Erica Yee,Good thing I'm not that sensitive,33,6,10:53:35
Ben Fickes,"Also I had a game idea (based off of someone else's idea) for game capstone, I'll send when I can",97,20,10:42:05
Ben Fickes,Okay I think Victor is gonna do what he's gonna do and he just wants sympathy/pity from you. Maybe I'm just jaded about his messages haha,137,26,10:38:37
Erica Yee,(not actually),14,2,10:11:26
Erica Yee,"I Easter egged ""3 of us""",24,6,10:11:24
Ben Fickes,You skipped 3) in your victor list haha. What advice specifically did he not like (or just all of it),101,20,10:07:43
Erica Yee,But the default setting was sooo hard,37,7,10:07:27
Erica Yee,It seems like if elliptical and step machine had a baby,55,11,10:07:14
Erica Yee,Thank you ð,14,3,10:06:59
Erica Yee,Also Victor 1) doesn't like my advice (what else is new) and 2) thought Sunday was with my roommates but is 4) now reluctantly ok with just the 3 of us lol and 5) said games sounds good (I said you had both video and board),223,46,10:06:47
Ben Fickes,Which machine?,14,2,10:06:47
Ben Fickes,Time for me to avenge you by wrecking it,40,9,10:06:43
Erica Yee,I just tried a new machine at Marino and I think it completely wrecked me,73,15,10:04:59
Erica Yee,Nah new girl,12,3,10:04:44
Ben Fickes,Aw sorry to hear that. And sorry to hear that for Calvin - is that the girl he was going to meet with tonight?,110,24,9:53:06
Erica Yee,Ok it actually wasn't that bad. The girl is just a bit whack and he unmatched with her,86,18,9:14:38
Erica Yee,Calvin sent me like 15 screenshots on Snapchat that I'm scared to read,70,13,8:56:28
Erica Yee,A bit tired but ok. I have two alarms and usually go back to sleep between them but couldn't for some reason so should've just gotten up earlier..,146,28,8:56:03
Ben Fickes,"When you wake up, how are you feeling?",38,8,8:37:25

Erica Yee,It's not class time yet dude,28,6,23:47:10
Ben Fickes,I almost made it to centennial before I realized where I was and turned around,78,15,23:45:05
Ben Fickes,Left your place and literally just started walking in the wrong direction,73,12,23:44:49

Erica Yee,Like they used to be more ...well-groomed and now it's like wild,64,12,18:17:21
Erica Yee,Omg the two other guys in this class were in research methods last semester and they both grew out their hair like Justin Bieber,128,24,18:16:51
Erica Yee,One of my freshie contacts also has class during lg,51,10,18:15:33
Ben Fickes,Lemme know haha,15,3,18:13:57
Erica Yee,Time to see how long class actually is,38,8,18:13:02
Erica Yee,Wow also smooth,15,3,18:12:43
Ben Fickes,He blamed the wall,18,4,18:09:33
Ben Fickes,"Dan just tapped me on the shoulder and denied it was him. But Iâm working at my desk and we are literally the only two in the apartment, plus heâs standing next to me",170,34,18:09:28
Ben Fickes,Iâll write my way out,23,5,18:04:33
Erica Yee,But I will never be satisfied,29,6,17:58:58
Erica Yee,True true,9,2,17:58:54
Ben Fickes,"I found you original goldfish, what more do you expect of me",60,12,17:53:52
Erica Yee,But I guess bad puns will feed my soul,38,9,17:52:29
Erica Yee,I would also appreciate you helping me not starve,49,9,17:52:19
Ben Fickes,But also for some reason makes me cringe slightly so thank you for being satisfied with bad puns in place of smooth date lines,126,24,17:48:43
Ben Fickes,Woooow that is smooth,21,4,17:47:59
Erica Yee,Unless my trying too many times put like $20k in that I don't actually have haha,80,16,17:42:25
Ben Fickes,Whoâs the third? And gotcha. Hope it goes well,48,9,17:35:01
Erica Yee,Trying to open an IRA,21,5,17:33:52
Erica Yee,Think I need to try on a school computer cuz all my browsers are configured to clear cookies and I think that could be what's messing it up lol,143,29,17:33:48
Erica Yee,Nope. I'm trying to give them money...but it won't let me,57,11,17:33:12
Erica Yee,3 currently,11,2,17:32:48
Ben Fickes,"Does he have more than the two? And gotcha, was it alright?",59,12,17:29:11
Erica Yee,Sorry was on the phone with the bamk,36,8,17:16:25
Erica Yee,Ohhh that makes more sense,26,5,17:16:21
Erica Yee,He was like don't know how to schedule these all,48,10,17:16:16
Ben Fickes,It was a post credit scene haha,31,7,16:43:46
Ben Fickes,Wait heâs actually complaining about how to schedule so many dates? ðð,78,12,16:43:39
Erica Yee,(Except I think it was only in the trailer not the actual movie iirc..?),72,14,16:42:36
Erica Yee,"Since he's now complaining about how to schedule so many dates instead of the opposite as before, I sent him this",113,21,16:42:16
Ben Fickes,I did!,6,2,16:41:22
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Iâm laughing at my desk,40,8,16:41:18
Erica Yee,Did you watch wreck it Ralph 2,30,7,16:41:08
Erica Yee,Adding that to marriage issues doc..,36,6,16:40:01
Ben Fickes,Or I suppose just FPB will do,29,7,16:39:17
Ben Fickes,Wow I just need to legally change my last name to FFPB,54,12,16:39:01
Ben Fickes,Meaning I strongly agree with your view on this dating stuff,60,11,16:38:46
Erica Yee,BPFFPB,6,1,16:38:38
Ben Fickes,And wow now I feel left out of the palindromes,46,10,16:37:34
Ben Fickes,I feel like I strongly agree with you on that haha,50,11,16:37:14
Erica Yee,EEYEE,5,1,16:36:07
Erica Yee,Yeah that all makes sense to me. I also have to keep in mind that he has to meet them in person in order to see who he wants to pursue more. But thanks for understanding,169,36,16:36:02
Ben Fickes,*palindrome,11,1,16:35:38
Ben Fickes,^a plaindrome,13,2,16:35:32
Ben Fickes,Mr owl ate my metal worm,24,6,16:35:27
Ben Fickes,Oh I saw that actually,22,5,16:34:57
Erica Yee,Happy palindrome week btw,25,4,16:34:46
Erica Yee,Yay me,6,2,16:33:11
Ben Fickes,"I guess also I remember when Marcus talked about this I thought âisnât scheduling dates with multiple people assuming that none of them will be anything special?â I know itâs different for online dating (or really, I donât, I just assume so) but I feel like I sharply dislike the idea of pursuing more than one person at once",335,59,16:27:14
Ben Fickes,"Like on the one hand, he doesnât know any of them, so it seems actually harmful for him to get worked up over one and convince himself sheâs âthe oneâ and ignore all others and then only move on if thereâs a âbreakup.â But also I feel like the idea of âshoppingâ for women makes me feel icky (to use your word). And at some point (hopefully early on) you have to dedicate yourself to one person, you canât just have multiple âcontendersâ forever (not that thereâs any evidence I see of him doing that, thatâs just general thoughts)",559,99,16:25:34
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,16:24:26
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was thinking about that earlier too. More thoughts in message to follow haha,83,15,16:22:44
Erica Yee,"Speaking of, I know this is kinda the point of online dating, but I feel like it's hard to encourage Calvin in pursuing multiple girls simultaneously... Theoretically I don't think it's wrong at this stage but it still feels icky to me ugh",239,43,16:22:04
Ben Fickes,Aw thanks Erica :) you bear mine for sure haha,46,10,16:21:29
Erica Yee,"You seriously do, thank you :)",30,6,16:21:03
Ben Fickes,Haha itâs okay. I help bear your burdens,42,8,16:20:44
Erica Yee,"Sorry, you def didn't need to know that either LOL",50,10,16:20:31
Ben Fickes,...wow wellllll guess you learn something new every day,55,9,16:20:16
Erica Yee,Idk ... Honestly don't get what she's saying half the time. She randomly tells me about her friends and I'm like ok?? Did not need to know that your friend in California just got an IUD and it really hurts ð¬,210,41,16:19:37
Ben Fickes,Yes it actually was me,22,5,16:18:36
Ben Fickes,Like was she saying her guy friend is taller than me and thatâs why she was gonna mention my height or something?,115,22,16:18:31
Ben Fickes,Haha ð wait was that what Mary was saying about me being tall? I couldnât exactly tell what she was saying,111,21,16:18:04
Erica Yee,Blond*,6,1,16:17:50
Erica Yee,So it could've been you if Sophie thinks blonde is dark and you're tall and I would've never known,98,19,16:17:46
Erica Yee,"Sophie: was he tall?
Me: idk, I didn't turn around
Sophie: but did he have dark hair?
Me: IDK I DIDN'T TURN AROUND",114,23,16:17:07
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,16:16:35
Ben Fickes,Maybe youâre just daydreaming about my voice,46,7,16:15:33
Erica Yee,Another pharmacy person,23,3,16:15:14
Erica Yee,But I didn't turn around and hope they didn't try to talk to me (my door was open tho),86,19,16:15:10
Erica Yee,Also I have been wearing headphones but I heard a guy's voice at one point between songs so maybe Mary's friend was still here actually,135,25,16:14:58
Ben Fickes,Whoâs jaewon?,15,2,16:14:38
Ben Fickes,Dang I wanted to assert my dominance over all other guests,58,11,16:14:33
Erica Yee,So good thing you didn't come over lol,38,8,16:14:11
Erica Yee,"Apparently Mary also brought someone over, and they were trying to cook at the same time Sophie and jaewon were",111,20,16:14:06
Erica Yee,Aww ok,6,2,15:36:26
Ben Fickes,"Class was good, actually paid attention the whole time haha. But it doesnât really help with the hw",101,18,15:17:54
Ben Fickes,Was about to say âwhich bookâ haha. Glad you finished it,60,11,15:17:35
Erica Yee,How was class,13,3,15:16:09
Erica Yee,Yay I just finished the book,28,6,15:16:08
Erica Yee,It also sounds incredibly interesting,37,5,15:16:04
Ben Fickes,Wow thatâs sad but itâs okay because at least we have each other,68,13,15:10:18
Erica Yee,Wow really? Looks like it's just the two of us alone in this mission forever,76,15,15:05:30
Ben Fickes,And whoah me too. Looks like you did a better job of taking down their stock price though,89,18,14:55:14
Ben Fickes,Lemme know if you discover it,29,6,14:54:59
Erica Yee,"Anyway I think that book was actually a library book that my mom borrowed that I randomly picked up, so many she remembers it haha",130,25,14:53:16
Erica Yee,I've been infiltrating pivotal for the last year,48,8,14:52:41
Erica Yee,I don't know how to tell you this so I'll just say it,53,13,14:52:28
Ben Fickes,I've thought about that - what if you were trying to undermine some evil corporate entity you were working for but you had to be consistent in your lie about it so everyone you know thought you were supporting them,214,40,14:49:29
Ben Fickes,Wow that is incredibly sad but also sounds really interesting,61,10,14:48:35
Erica Yee,"Historical fiction, England I think. The main couple are perceived as ""villains"" by other characters cuz they seem evil. But it's really a front to do good work (think they were spies..?). And in the end they're the only people who know the ""real"" versions of themselves and have no other friends which is sad but it's ok because they have each other",350,63,14:47:47
Ben Fickes,what was it about?,18,4,14:46:44
Erica Yee,Actually that reminds me of this book I read years ago that I can't remember the name of but I really want to find it and read it again,135,29,14:46:22
Erica Yee,Lool,4,1,14:46:02
Ben Fickes,"Sounds good, Iâve been working on Jason for the past 2.5 years, itâd be great to have your help",99,19,14:43:49
Erica Yee,I think we should fuse our humor and annoy everyone around us,61,12,14:40:15
Ben Fickes,Maybe we should fuse our phones into one device to compromise,61,11,14:31:50
Erica Yee,Yeah I first had android cuz it was way cheaper in hs and then just stayed in the ecosystem,91,19,14:31:11
Erica Yee,"Oops forgot to add ""but opposite"" in my message haha",52,10,14:30:31
Ben Fickes,I just have iPhone because that's the phone my parents got me in hs,67,14,14:29:44
Ben Fickes,"from that message, shouldn't you switch?",40,6,14:29:25
Erica Yee,Jk I actually think iPhones are a better product in general. But I prefer android for other reasons,99,18,14:29:22
Erica Yee,Switch phones,13,2,14:28:54
Ben Fickes,Wait keep up with what,22,5,14:28:42
Erica Yee,Keep ðupð,15,2,14:27:54
Erica Yee,I might .... Cut you off,24,6,14:27:33
Ben Fickes,(I know that was an especially bad pun),39,8,14:27:18
Ben Fickes,As long as it wasn't a sign that you were board of my company,61,14,14:27:08
Ben Fickes,No worries haha,15,3,14:26:28
Erica Yee,Oops sorry forgot to wash/put away cutting board on your counter..my bad,72,12,13:45:17
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha, I'll be down then",34,7,11:24:53
Erica Yee,Can be over in 10,17,5,11:24:42
Erica Yee,Sorry was showering,19,3,11:24:28
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,11:24:22
Ben Fickes,oh class just ended haha,24,5,11:06:35
Ben Fickes,awesome,7,1,11:03:04
Erica Yee,"Oh jaewon is coming over at 1130 so I will def go to yours at 11:45, np",71,17,11:01:46
Ben Fickes,Or if you don't wanna leave your place I can come over for a late or early lunch,80,18,10:59:13
Ben Fickes,"I'll be back around 11:45, feel free to bring it over whenever",62,12,10:58:58
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing,15,3,10:58:42
Erica Yee,Someone else is coming over for lunch soon so depending on timing is it ok if i bring the dressing to yours instead?,116,23,10:58:28
Ben Fickes,Neither do I woman,18,4,10:51:52
Erica Yee,Idk man,7,2,10:51:32
Ben Fickes,How do all of your roommates stay up so late and wake up so early,65,15,10:51:01
Erica Yee,Omg Sophie wants to play at 7,29,7,10:50:36
Erica Yee,It's ok I ran out of witty replies anyway xD,44,10,10:41:18
Ben Fickes,"I was just purposefully misinterpreting what you said, I think you said it perfectly correctly though",101,16,10:37:53
Erica Yee,Ok you win grammar police haha,30,6,10:36:49
Ben Fickes,Because I do not know that for a fact,37,9,10:23:13
Ben Fickes,Did they teach you in j school that our families are heavily intermarried,73,13,10:23:07
Erica Yee,That assumption goes against everything I learned in j school,61,10,10:22:44
Erica Yee,Do you know that for a fact,27,7,10:22:21
Ben Fickes,I have a feeling our families are not intermarried anywhere in recent history,77,13,10:15:45
Ben Fickes,HAHA oh my goodness,19,4,10:15:31
Erica Yee,I can research and add it to our marriage issues doc,52,11,10:14:30
Ben Fickes,Just curious haha,17,3,10:13:46
Erica Yee,They didn't say haha,20,4,10:13:04
Ben Fickes,And will do :),14,4,10:12:11
Ben Fickes,Haha nice. What were the requirements to be able to marry?,58,11,10:12:07
Erica Yee,"Just remind me to sleep early ish Friday, thanks :)",51,10,10:11:48
Erica Yee,Listening to this podcast about history of information graphics and they're talking about tree-like graphs in the middle ages that people used to diagram how you were related to other people to see if you could marry them. But the trees would get very confusing when noble families kept intermarrying lolol,306,51,10:11:16
Ben Fickes,"Right but we probably won't stay at bfig for more than a few hours, if you want to push it back. No pressure just don't wanna make you lose sleep",145,30,10:10:32
Erica Yee,"It's ok, if we don't shower we can leave campus 845ish",54,11,10:09:42
Ben Fickes,I'm good with going to bfig a little later if that helps you sleep in,69,15,10:07:41
Ben Fickes,But also have fun playing tennis haha,37,7,10:07:07
Ben Fickes,I'm surprised she's willing to wake up so early,47,9,10:07:01
Ben Fickes,dang have fun waking up early haha,34,7,10:06:49
Erica Yee,Barbara and I are gonna play tennis 730 on sat lmaoo,52,11,10:06:03
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,9:47:15
Ben Fickes,I have class now until 11:30 I think but then I can come over,61,14,9:44:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was hoping to haha,25,6,9:44:38
Erica Yee,Aren't you coming for lunch anyway,34,6,9:43:54
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm free till class at 6,29,7,9:43:43
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna work together at all later? No pressure,52,10,9:31:08
Ben Fickes,Glad to hear both of those things haha,38,8,7:56:59
Erica Yee,But I think I am now and made a friend,38,10,7:55:41
Erica Yee,I thought I was in the wrong class cuz I didn't recognize anyone,64,13,7:55:31
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,7:55:19
Ben Fickes,Hope you have a good class,26,6,7:50:05
Erica Yee,Lol true that,13,3,22:00:25
Ben Fickes,But thanks haha,15,3,21:56:57
Ben Fickes,Besides Jesus besides you of course,35,6,21:56:54
Erica Yee,Beside me of course,19,4,21:56:06
Erica Yee,Ctrl+shift+v is your best friend,32,5,21:56:02
Ben Fickes,I just realized that the email I sent for IV has a different font size for the copy pasted portion ð¬,103,21,21:55:18
Ben Fickes,Oh Iâll check soon haha,25,5,21:54:39
Erica Yee,"Ohh me either, I meant the IV blog (linked in twiv)",51,11,21:54:20
Ben Fickes,Thanks. And aw thatâs nice (havenât read her blog recently though),70,11,21:53:07
Erica Yee,Aw just read Molly's blog post and her graf about worship nights made me really happy,85,16,21:47:36
Erica Yee,Ok to both,10,3,21:44:20
Ben Fickes,"Yeah, in connection with me telling you Iâd always try last night too",71,13,21:41:05
Ben Fickes,"Also as obvious as this sounds, if you wouldnât mind praying about after college before we talk about it (because I am too) (and after we talk too ofc)",153,29,21:40:44
Erica Yee,The trying doing thing?,23,4,21:40:10
Ben Fickes,I was gonna say please remind me to talk to you about âtryingâ (came up during ST),86,17,21:39:50
Ben Fickes,And I enjoy either so feel feee to use whichever you wish,57,12,21:39:17
Ben Fickes,You are irreplaceable but Iâm glad Julia is getting community too,67,11,21:38:38
Erica Yee,Ok I've been trying that emoji instead of ð but i don't think I like it,74,16,21:37:12
Erica Yee,Lol am I getting replaced ð,30,6,21:36:48
Erica Yee,"Me: thanks for taking Julia to small group
Tiffany (in chat with Calvin): omg she's so fun!!",92,17,21:36:32
Ben Fickes,After you haha,14,3,21:36:13
Ben Fickes,Oh glad you got there on time,29,7,21:03:52
Erica Yee,It was fine. Actually got there earlier than needed to be so I just played Sega heroes in the hallway (the room was too full to go in),134,28,21:02:55
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,21:02:04
Ben Fickes,How was it,10,3,21:00:51
Ben Fickes,Sure if you donât mind,24,5,21:00:48
Erica Yee,Want to come now? Just finished meeting,39,7,21:00:30
Ben Fickes,Oh with whom? And when and how is he feeling about it,53,12,20:36:03
Erica Yee,Calvin got a date lol,21,5,20:21:33
Erica Yee,Coming,6,1,17:16:14
Ben Fickes,Omw,3,1,17:13:31

Erica Yee,np haha,7,2,15:27:47
Ben Fickes,Sorry in my head I replied to that when you sent it,51,12,15:22:54
Ben Fickes,Sounds good!,12,2,15:22:44
Erica Yee,5:15?,5,1,15:08:03
Erica Yee,yes,3,1,15:07:59
Ben Fickes,And what time?,14,3,15:07:13
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing. Can I use your kitchenware?,44,8,15:07:04
Erica Yee,Do you mind coming over?,24,5,15:06:43
Ben Fickes,When do you wanna meet to eat,29,7,15:04:44
Ben Fickes,Oh I remember you telling me about the meeting now,50,10,15:04:38
Erica Yee,So sure!,8,2,15:04:13
Erica Yee,I was trying to decide whether I should eat before or after. But I'm going to hunt news meeting after so I guess before,119,24,15:03:16
Erica Yee,"It's ok, I rather be bored for 40 mins than lost",48,11,15:02:41
Ben Fickes,Or we can meet up and head over together,40,9,15:02:06
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna eat together before ST? I have leftovers I need to eat,67,14,15:01:48
Ben Fickes,"Was gonna ask you about class, sorry it was mostly stuff you knew. And will do!",79,16,15:01:32
Erica Yee,"But when I see you remind me to tell you the ""push"" story",57,13,14:56:10
Erica Yee,Especially cuz he had one of the CS majors explain git in the beginning and the student talked so much unnecessarily about branches,131,23,14:55:15
Erica Yee,I feel like if I didn't know them already I would be so confused,64,14,14:54:43
Erica Yee,2/3 of class was learning how to use markdown and github (desktop),66,12,14:54:27
Erica Yee,I think we're past that stage but thanks lol,44,9,14:54:04
Ben Fickes,Iâll keep that in mind next time I write you a letter haha,60,13,14:48:44
Ben Fickes,"Wait Iâve definitely heard that before, maybe you did tell me. But thank you for sharing",90,16,14:48:32
Erica Yee,It's in a letter he writes to her (which she sees him write I think) aghhh so romantic,86,18,14:44:42
Erica Yee,"Lol but the full line is something like ""You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope.""",89,18,14:44:23
Erica Yee,"You can use ""half agony, half hope""",35,7,14:43:59
Ben Fickes,And no I donât think you have,31,7,14:41:49
Ben Fickes,Will do,7,2,14:41:44
Erica Yee,Did I ever tell you the most famous line from persuasion,56,11,14:41:36
Erica Yee,And lol omg,11,3,14:41:23
Erica Yee,Lemme know if you ever find out what it is,42,10,14:39:57
Ben Fickes,"Okay hereâs my idea for the sign off progressions:
Warmly
Yours
Most Ardently
Love
Yours in Christ
So is it written, so shall it be done",138,26,13:39:55

Erica Yee,Lol JK,6,2,13:16:00
Erica Yee,Did you try reading the first letter of every line,50,10,13:15:58
Ben Fickes,Oh my writing prof said thereâs an Easter egg in the syllabus we should follow to show weâve read it carefully. But Iâve read it twice and havenât found it...,166,30,13:13:04
Erica Yee,Haha ok,7,2,13:04:14
Ben Fickes,And there definitely was but I forget it now haha,49,10,12:59:50
Ben Fickes,"Ofc, I love your stories",24,5,12:59:39
Erica Yee,Is there more context to Dan's?,31,6,12:59:20
Erica Yee,Thanks for appreciating :),26,4,12:59:01
Ben Fickes,"I can picture this scene very clearly, thanks for sharing haha",62,11,12:52:53
Ben Fickes,Holy cow one month old!?!? Dang the pastor was really planning ahead,68,12,12:52:37
Erica Yee,"I rolled my eyes and said that comment. But Sophie was like ""really?!"" And then I said NO even more loudly so hopefully no one in the vicinity thinks Christians are too weird..",176,33,12:37:51
Erica Yee,"Sophie was telling me a story about how when she was one month old, the pastor of their church told her mom that she needed to join the youth group when she got old enough so she could find a husband",199,41,12:37:12
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,12:35:48
Ben Fickes,"In a similar no context story, last night Dan said âBen, you should jump off a bridgeâ",90,17,12:31:28
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð so what was the context?,34,7,12:31:09
Erica Yee,"No context story: I very loudly in resmail said ""MARRIAGE IS OUR HIGHEST CALLING""",81,14,12:30:27
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,12:12:35
Erica Yee,Lol yes,7,2,12:02:42
Ben Fickes,Very random but could I come over tomorrow during lunch and use your salad dressing haha,88,16,11:57:12
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs really interesting, thanks for sharing",50,7,11:56:38
Erica Yee,"I think it's made of cardboard..don't really remember. And I did, it's really good",82,14,11:50:07
Erica Yee,(Tiffany just randomly shared that pic again haha),50,8,11:49:50
Erica Yee,But what she's most known for was being first Asian woman elected to state legislature (representing Oakland area) and successfully banning paid toilets since urinals were free. She brought a chained toilet up to the house steps and smashed it with a sledgehammer,263,43,11:49:34
Erica Yee,We profiled this California politician who was the state secretary of state and first Asian American elected to such a high office,130,22,11:48:29
Erica Yee,I guess so haha. Glad you feel good,35,8,11:47:06
Ben Fickes,"And thatâs good, I remember her criticizing her cooking. Did you try one?",75,13,11:42:14
Ben Fickes,Whatâs the toilet project? And is that toilet paper itâs made of? I almost burst out laughing in class (again),114,20,11:41:52
Ben Fickes,I think there can be a cultural aspect to Christianity sometimes that might be what he feels. But ofc thatâs not whatâs actually important,142,24,11:40:56
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing about Calvin - I think you said exactly the right thing,74,14,11:39:53
Ben Fickes,Iâm feeling good! Slept in until 9:30 about so actually pretty good sleep time without sleeping in too late,109,19,11:39:33

Ben Fickes,sorry will reply to all this after class,40,8,11:19:12
Erica Yee,"Sophie made blondies and I'm happy because she actually called them ""pretty good"" which is very rare for her to speak positively about her baking. But there's espresso chips in it and she said she ate 3 pieces last night and couldn't sleep lol",243,44,11:07:39
Erica Yee,Also here's the toilet we made for a history day project senior year,68,13,11:02:45

Erica Yee,Omg your mom is a higher arena rank than me,43,10,20:23:01
Erica Yee,Oh idk,6,2,20:11:17
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was also wondering about that. And I was wondering if the filter was due to your influence,97,19,20:06:12
Erica Yee,I know he originally filtered all the apps to just Christian. But then I guess he expanded the filters a lil haha,113,22,20:04:02
Ben Fickes,I see. Just curious haha thanks for sharing,43,8,20:03:28
Erica Yee,So I just skirt the issue with mmmmms and okkkks,48,10,20:00:48
Erica Yee,"I clearly remember my mom telling me years ago to not tell ""younger"" Christians that they shouldn't date non Christians",119,20,20:00:27
Erica Yee,Yeah she was agnostic,21,4,19:59:51
Ben Fickes,You actually told me about that haha I meant when they started dating though,76,14,19:59:39
Erica Yee,IT WAS SO WEIRD,15,4,19:59:15
Erica Yee,SHE BECAME A CHRISTIAN WHILE THEY WERE DATING APPARENTLY,56,9,19:59:11
Ben Fickes,I guess his ex wasnât Christian right?,40,7,19:58:48
Ben Fickes,Do you know his thoughts on dating non Christians,49,9,19:58:33
Ben Fickes,I guess we shouldnât make assumptions,39,6,19:58:23
Erica Yee,"""unknown"" ð¬ð¤",18,2,19:52:44
Ben Fickes,Is she Christian?,17,3,19:48:28
Ben Fickes,Yeah I hope so too. And wow sounds like they had a good talk hopefully,70,15,19:48:20
Erica Yee,Yeah she talked about how her dad is a trump supporter,54,11,19:47:01
Erica Yee,And I'm hoping joining the young adult small group at the church will help fulfil his community need,100,18,19:46:47
Ben Fickes,Did they talk after that,24,5,19:46:40
Erica Yee,So guess it's continuing for now,32,6,19:45:54
Erica Yee,"She actually responded, ""you do you man""",40,7,19:45:44
Erica Yee,Yeah the Bible never mentions God embodied a starfish,53,9,19:45:26
Ben Fickes,Did the one girl message him again,34,7,19:44:26

Erica Yee,"Reading the intro of the book and the author is like ""I am forever indebted to my friend XX for introducing me to regular expressions"" ð",139,26,12:39:49
Erica Yee,Your Love is Extravagant & Free Falling | WorshipMob Cover: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=-YFwm15Asg4,105,11,12:39:07

Ben Fickes,Plus I feel like it was mostly you me and ty walking together,61,13,12:14:08
Ben Fickes,Not gonna pretend like I can read ty super well all the time but I think heâs pretty indifferent to his surroundings and doesnât really engage in a lot of talking with anyone,178,33,12:13:56
Erica Yee,Do you think ty feels like I co-opted walking group lol,55,11,12:08:58

Erica Yee,Thank* omg now I'm doing the opposite,37,7,7:55:38
Erica Yee,Aww Ben. You're so welcome and so worth it. I thanks God everyday for you,73,15,7:55:31
Ben Fickes,"I was praying for a bit and I was praying for you and about you and I wanted to say again thank you for being such a blessing to me. And I know we use the word âblessingâ semi-frequently but I was reflecting about how much in my life Iâve prayed for companionship. And a huge part of God answering that prayer are my friends and roommates and others who build me up. But I also think about how much you have been with me, both physically and emotionally, since weâve known each other. I think about when you sat with me until 3 am in New York. I think about when you came to thanksgiving and laughed a ton. I think about when we talk about our relationship and you tell me you care. I think about when you listen to my worries and overthinking and still bear with me despite my craziness. I think about when you take my arm and things just feel alright. And Iâm honestly shocked that I ever got to have you with me in my life, and I just thank God for his mercy. So thank you for just being with me. It means so much to me",1032,205,23:41:08
Ben Fickes,Streak ending,13,2,23:34:50

Ben Fickes,What happens if he signs you in to get me,41,10,15:39:40
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah,7,2,15:39:19

Erica Yee,"oh good thing you told me, all my text columns are N except a blank",67,15,20:03:18
Ben Fickes,"Hey Wesley,

I'm Ben, a fourth year who attends Intervarsity. You probably met some of my friends at Fall Fest (and/or the ice cream social). Anyways, just wanted to say that if you have any questions (about IV, faith, college, or just wanna chat) just let me know! My number is 302-750-3364 or I reply to email. And regardless, we all meet up for large group on Tuesdays at 6:30 in 14 International Village, so maybe I'll see you there.

All the best as you start college!
Ben",477,88,20:03:03

Erica Yee,Makes sense,11,2,19:56:05
Ben Fickes,"For strangers, yes. Probably not the mindset I should have but if they choose to never reply and the convo drops into the void neither person feels awkward and I donât feel like I messed up wording",199,37,19:55:33
Erica Yee,You prefer email?,17,3,19:54:25
Ben Fickes,"All mine are noâs, ptl",24,5,19:53:58

Erica Yee,ok,2,1,19:44:49
Ben Fickes,You check whether youâre interested or unsure about Christianity,66,9,19:44:01
Ben Fickes,I feel like I miscommunicated something,39,6,19:43:48
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah it is,13,4,19:43:38
Erica Yee,wait no the familiarity column must be christianity?,52,8,19:43:10
Erica Yee,wow free will,13,3,19:42:34
Ben Fickes,Thatâs also the only option besides interested,48,7,19:42:24
Ben Fickes,I guess,7,2,19:42:15
Erica Yee,unsure about christianity?,26,3,19:42:07
Erica Yee,"Iâm Davae from InterVarsity Multiethnic Christian Fellowship (FB group is here!). You might have met me (or a friend of mine) at an IV table. I hope youâve been doing well during the first few weeks of school. Iâd love to meet you sometime to get to know you - our community gathers together on Tuesday nights at 7pm at the African American Institute (40 Leon Street) - if you want to come and want to walk over with me, let me know! - Iâd love to take you! If not, no worries but we are always here if you need.",520,101,19:41:59
Erica Yee,well maybe it is,16,4,19:41:57
Ben Fickes,âUnsureâ,12,1,19:41:51

Erica Yee,oooooh it's in christianity,27,4,19:41:05
Ben Fickes,âI noticed you are uninterested in Christianity - would you like to talk about it?â,87,15,19:40:52
Erica Yee,ok i just pulled up davae's email for inspiration from 9/30/16,62,11,19:40:36

Ben Fickes,Uh not sure but I think maybe either unfamiliar or uninterested? Good luck haha,79,14,19:39:48
Ben Fickes,Lemme pull it up,16,4,19:39:03
Erica Yee,"waht does ""U"" in interest column signify",40,7,19:38:45
Ben Fickes,âIâm here to follow upâ is not helpful I expect,53,10,19:38:17
Ben Fickes,Wait I donât actually know what to say for this IV contact,60,12,19:38:01
Ben Fickes,Haha nice. Sure thatâs fine,29,5,19:37:49

Erica Yee,"oh i'm probably not going to create a new account tonight so we could do it together, or you can do it now",106,23,19:34:21
Erica Yee,well it was basically thinking about in general about the future...not imagining myself in those scenarios exactly,114,17,19:33:54
Ben Fickes,I think Iâm gonna text and say âthanks for showing interest in IV!â In the opening or something like that,111,20,19:33:30
Ben Fickes,I figured there was more to it haha. And should I get havitica now? Donât wanna get left behind haha,102,20,19:32:57
Erica Yee,also do you think i can just text my contacts or is that creepy...don't wanna go through email if we're just gonna end up texting,129,25,19:29:03

Ben Fickes,I havenât met any of mine either. And whaaaat thatâs actually gonna come off as kinda creepy,96,17,19:17:16
Erica Yee,"also none of the people i got assigned to for IV i've met before, oh well should be interesting. i remember davae took me out to dinner and didn't eat",150,30,19:15:23

Ben Fickes,What would site operations be?,30,5,19:02:12
Erica Yee,"i have to decide whether i want to lean more towards site operations or design. they do use wordpress, and there's limited what you can customize code-wise unfortunately. but lots of opportunities still to experiment and break things",233,38,18:58:50
Ben Fickes,Do you have any other thoughts on it then? Besides liking the leader?,69,13,18:57:34
Erica Yee,And no worries I just remembered too haha. It's just sprinkling a little,72,13,18:56:43

Erica Yee,"Shouldn't, hunt news is 6:10 and nu sci is 8",44,10,10:07:08
Ben Fickes,Does it conflict with hunt news?,32,6,10:03:03
Erica Yee,Also that I slacked on editing this summer and forgot about two of my writers...oh well,87,16,9:52:44
Erica Yee,Just found out there's a last minute nu sci meeting tonight lmao,64,12,9:52:25

Erica Yee,That's great there's enough people this time. And that never occurred to me but good for you for being so self-aware,116,21,8:42:23
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I actually have too, and when we practiced it I thought âwow I could actually do this again.â But I know there are enough other people and I also feel weird about being a white male and being the âfaceâ (to newcomers) of a multiethnic fellowship",258,47,8:40:00
Erica Yee,I've done it a few times and you can probably guess that it's not my favorite type of ministry but I'd rather do it for something I truly believe in than any other club,168,34,8:38:36
Erica Yee,LOL you are amazing,19,4,8:37:27
Ben Fickes,"Iâm helping with the setup. So Iâm gonna head out to centennial in like half an hour to wait in line, get our table, and wait until someone else arrives. But then Iâm gonna leave haha",189,36,8:35:51
Erica Yee,Are you helping tabling?,24,4,8:34:39

Erica Yee,I'm trying not to be,20,5,22:46:29
Erica Yee,Nah my family will eat it,25,6,22:46:13
Ben Fickes,"Can you save them to eat on the plane? And I know, I hope youâre not frustrated at yourself",93,19,22:44:12
Erica Yee,Also the tacos looked really good lol,37,7,22:43:43
Erica Yee,"It better. Thanks they said it was ok, I'm just frustrated",58,11,22:43:03
Ben Fickes,"Oh no Iâm so sorry. Do you think itâll go away for the flight? I donât think it ruins it, I think your company is what they care about",140,29,22:36:48
Erica Yee,Ugh actually have a headache now and not eating the food I ordered oops. I feel like I kinda ruined last supper,111,22,22:07:14

Ben Fickes,Wait I didnât know you went to Canada and stayed with a host?,63,13,21:31:53
Erica Yee,Ooh I remember that from when I went to Canada. Our host put the whole bag in a pitcher thing,93,20,21:31:18

Ben Fickes,"I replied to the music email - I didnât send new songs but referenced two vids (okay, ones a song) in my reply. Just wanted to give you a heads up. Also realize you might not have a chance to read it but thatâs okay",219,45,21:18:48
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. So is he gonna go out with her? And how is he doing with this stuff in general?,88,20,21:11:32
Erica Yee,The main reason I recognized her was she's a teacher at the elementary school our high school used to be connected to,117,22,20:49:21
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah when we were looking at Calvin's ""bagels"" (suggested matches on coffee meets bagel) I recognized a person from the church we visited last week that we talked to for a bit, but he didn't recognize her at all LOL. Guess there's no attraction there..",255,46,20:48:53

Erica Yee,I feel ok about it. Family is gonna walk around the lake later,62,13,20:46:29
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well hope you can get some rest tonight then. How are you feeling about it being your last night in CA for a bit?,121,25,20:41:47
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Quite tired. We played FIFA a bit after the movie and managed to lose even using the OP US women's team,111,23,20:36:01
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,20:14:14
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,20:11:40

Erica Yee,Was it a good talk,18,5,19:03:17
Erica Yee,Wow,3,1,19:02:54
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,19:02:52
Ben Fickes,"I get there at 3:30 and heâs at ups with a bin. He tells me that theyâre closed but he got the confirmation email theyâd deliver between 3 and 5 so he wanted to wait there. I asked if we should call someone and he said ânah, Iâm just gonna wait until 5.â  So I waited with him and talked until 5 and they never came. So then heâs talking about rescheduling the pickup time and he said âso when would work for you?â So I might be helping him again haha",469,92,17:37:37
Ben Fickes,Castle situation was so funny and very him,42,8,17:34:45

Ben Fickes,Oh no worries! Also Iâm gonna pay you back for half the ice cream because itâs for everyone at the social,109,21,14:07:16
Erica Yee,"Just reread ""that you will have access to"" so guess not yet, ignore the above please haha",89,17,14:02:12
Erica Yee,"Oh wait I mean the sheet of new people we're assigned to reach out to, not the list of ST people",96,21,13:37:24

Ben Fickes,You could always ask for another movie? And well maybe thatâs a sign to join our campaign...,94,17,12:34:16

Erica Yee,You're a good friend,20,4,11:32:19
Ben Fickes,"Itâs mind over matter, just dress like itâs summer and itâll be warm",74,13,11:31:23
Erica Yee,Wait he didn't even do the perfunctory how are you,50,10,11:29:52

Erica Yee,Wait it is not as hot as I packed for haha,42,11,11:22:32

Ben Fickes,"I guess the question is more or less than two hours (unless you wanna canoe together instead, in which case more or less than four hours)",137,26,11:17:46
Erica Yee,"Though the esplanade is more convenient, idk how we can make the most of the whole day past just between the Charles and Longfellow bridges",139,25,11:16:20
Erica Yee,I was motivated to find times cuz Barbara asked if anyone wanted to play tennis at 8:15am Saturday (so specific lol),116,21,11:15:29
Ben Fickes,Do you think youâd prefer hourly or whole day?,48,9,11:14:45

Erica Yee,https://www.tripsavvy.com/kayaking-canoeing-charles-river-boston-4173011,72,1,10:39:11

Ben Fickes,Aw Iâm glad it was good!,26,6,0:54:19
Erica Yee,It was super good catching up with relatives we barely see though. And I almost teared up when saying goodbye to my grandparents,128,23,23:15:49
Ben Fickes,Someone else haha. And HAHA I love it. Now I know better when you offer me leftovers haha,89,18,23:13:42
Erica Yee,So at my family dinner I was at the same table with this uncle who eats a looot and I was at the end of the lazy susan rotation so I didn't get as much as I wanted to. So I moved to the other table which had fewer people and ate most of their leftovers. Worked out well cuz an uncle at the second table ordered an extra dessert and we didn't share lol,351,75,23:11:22
Erica Yee,Did you or someone else take that,33,7,23:02:51
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,23:02:32
Ben Fickes,Enjoy a quality pic,19,4,21:05:55

Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing haha,23,4,19:22:44
Erica Yee,Sorry just a fun fact,21,5,19:02:57

Ben Fickes,Donât know if I have a real response but I appreciate you sharing your thoughts,81,15,18:30:11
Ben Fickes,âLots of boys for Juliaâ I thought that was really funny haha,65,12,18:29:30
Erica Yee,Especially on a day when all these new college students are visiting for the first time,87,16,18:04:01
Erica Yee,Oh also no one who welcomed us told us their name nor did the pastor introduce himself which annoys me,102,20,18:01:01
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening/reading,28,3,18:00:37
Erica Yee,Lol I always have so many thoughts ah,37,8,18:00:28
Erica Yee,"like ok yay praise God and I don't want to diminish the power of your testimony, but why bother mentioning it if you're not going to give the congregation any details?!?!",170,31,18:00:14
Erica Yee,"At the end he was like ""I told one of the small groups this story, but my family was going through a difficult situation. My wife and I were like let's do this, let's try that. But in the end God came through in a big way and it's all good now.""",245,52,17:59:19
Erica Yee,"The sermon was on acts 16, Paul's second missionary journey to bring in prison with Silas. I was pretty food coma in the beginning but by the end it was better. Not anything specific to share but it fit well with the ST discussion of the passage last semester",259,49,17:57:37
Erica Yee,I tried to give some whoooos for him,36,8,17:54:07
Erica Yee,It was okay. Lots of boys for Julia (especially Asians). A lot of it was the new black pastor trying to rouse Asian students to verbally engage and my soul hurt for him,168,33,17:53:53
Ben Fickes,I know it hasnât been published but idk,41,8,17:52:42
Erica Yee,Do you know if she's had any progress with the publication process,66,12,17:51:49
Erica Yee,Whoaa that's awesome,20,3,17:51:33
Ben Fickes,Chichi shared about her book and the faith aspects of it with a bunch of scholars people!,89,17,17:45:25
Ben Fickes,How was church?,15,3,17:44:42
Ben Fickes,Eh I wouldnât mind haha,25,5,17:44:38
Erica Yee,Good thing we aren't trying to go next weekend haha,51,10,17:44:01

Ben Fickes,Yep! Honestly feels so elitist but I like catching up with people and the free food,83,16,16:35:51
Erica Yee,Is it on one of the islands?,28,7,16:09:29
Erica Yee,Nice!,5,1,16:08:56

Erica Yee,"Mom: are you making one for Ben

Ben Fickes,Hmm I will take it in any form haha. And Iâm glad it meant a lot to her haha,78,19,14:51:37
Erica Yee,Ok my mom was right it made my sister happy even though I told her it's disturbing,82,17,14:51:12
Erica Yee,Do you want me to put a string on Moira? Idk where we're gonna put them,71,16,14:47:03

Erica Yee,I forgot to hole punch the OW one. Should I just have both logos as tokens rather than key chains?,98,20,14:44:28
Erica Yee,Wait real q,11,3,14:43:29
Erica Yee,ð¤¯ð¤¯,8,1,14:43:21
Ben Fickes,Iâm actually entirely bald and the hair you like so much is a wig,67,14,14:37:37
Erica Yee,Hopefully not extremely at your stage in life,45,8,14:28:09
Ben Fickes,Hair disconnecting is a natural and beautiful part of life,58,10,14:26:23
Erica Yee,Which scares me,15,3,14:24:59
Erica Yee,Torb has a lot of disconnected hair,35,7,14:24:50

Ben Fickes,Torbs for barbs?,16,3,14:16:10
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs not bad at all! Where did you get gray haha,55,12,14:16:02
Erica Yee,Hmm what should I do,20,5,14:15:18
Erica Yee,Also only have enough plastic for one more small one,52,10,14:15:15
Erica Yee,Eh I'll take them,17,4,14:15:03
Erica Yee,Omg lol no,10,3,14:14:47
Ben Fickes,What does it look like haha,27,6,14:14:29
Ben Fickes,Wow itâs even more like me,28,6,14:14:24
Erica Yee,Did not leave enough room for the hole punch..,46,9,13:59:06
Erica Yee,"Reinhardt is a mess, I think I peaked at the riptire lol",56,12,13:58:58
Erica Yee,I just copied an image I found online,37,8,13:58:30
Ben Fickes,Wait did you design yours thinking it was the nose?,51,10,13:54:29
Ben Fickes,Iâm pretty sure itâs the mouth haha,39,7,13:53:41
Erica Yee,Or maybe it's both?,19,4,13:44:05
Erica Yee,Omg I just realized that's the mouth not the nose,49,10,13:43:54
Ben Fickes,I didnât doubt you haha. At first I was gonna say âitâs less creepy when itâs smiling.â Then I looked at it for like a second longer and I completely take that thought back,182,34,13:42:35
Erica Yee,Just so you know I didn't make this up,38,9,13:40:10
Ben Fickes,Thank you for not giving me that one,36,8,13:33:29
Ben Fickes,That is disturbing,18,3,13:33:20
Ben Fickes,What,4,1,13:33:14
Erica Yee,Its name is Tata and it's a character that her favorite BTS member created (you can ask Renee if you really want to know more..),128,25,13:31:52
Erica Yee,It honestly disturbs me so much,31,6,13:30:34
Erica Yee,My mom said I should make one for Julia or else she'll feel left out,68,15,13:30:29
Ben Fickes,"HAHA I think purple Moira will remind me more of you anyways. And thank you for your permission, will keep that in mind ð",124,24,13:26:10
Erica Yee,Thanks I'm glad :) you are totally free to not like them though haha,68,14,13:25:17
Erica Yee,"TANGENT (why did that autocorrect to all caps, oh well keeping it) Vanessa gave us a bunch of her old art supplies for my mom to give to her patients, and there's an orange sharpie..........",190,35,13:24:59
Ben Fickes,I honestly do like the movies youâve picked so I donât mind,63,12,13:24:47
Erica Yee,"I feel I have monopolized our movie choices, so we can def watch it",67,14,13:24:16
Ben Fickes,Lemme know how The Godfather is. And if you ever wanna watch any lotr sometime Iâd be down but also thereâs a lot of movies you like Iâd like to watch,156,31,13:22:40
Erica Yee,And the first one on a school bus ride in which I fell asleep so not really,75,17,13:21:38
Erica Yee,Nope,4,1,13:21:24
Ben Fickes,And have you seen any lotr?,27,6,13:21:17
Ben Fickes,Have you seen it? The Godfather? I have not but heard itâs intense,68,13,13:21:07
Erica Yee,"But he was like ""all or nothing"" lol",36,8,13:20:48
Erica Yee,"He really wanted to do a LOTR marathon but I am not about sitting on the couch for 9 hours, so I was like ""ok we can watch the first one""",137,31,13:20:42
Erica Yee,Hanging out with Calvin one more time tomorrow bc I promised I would watch his fav movie the godfather,102,19,13:20:03
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was guessing so haha. But if anything comes up ofc Iâm here,68,14,13:19:46
Erica Yee,"As in I don't have much more to talk about, not that I don't want to talk",73,17,13:19:24
Erica Yee,"Not really rn, but thanks for asking",36,7,13:19:05
Ben Fickes,Aw Iâm really sorry to hear that. Anything in particular you want to talk about? And at least you can always call right? I know thatâs not the same and it doesnât make it easier though,190,36,13:17:52
Erica Yee,Saying goodbye to my friends yesterday hit especially hard. Even though I'll see them probably even later this year except Vanessa,130,21,13:14:06
Erica Yee,Yeah very true,14,3,13:12:18
Ben Fickes,Yeah I agree with that. But I do think the point about us not being able to comprehend wanting what we have because weâre taught to think about wanting what we donât have is a good one,188,37,13:08:45
Erica Yee,Oh interesting. I feel like some things could be explained by complacency rather than gratitude though,102,16,13:05:17
Ben Fickes,"I feel like thatâs not bad (on the waking up), because if you were at college and had somewhere to be Iâm sure youâd get out of bed for it",144,30,13:02:35
Ben Fickes,"And he talked about how this is an optimistic time of year but things always seem to get really hard in a month or two. And he talked about the two prominent Christians who lost faith and said âI donât know if they deserve our judgment, but I do know they deserve our prayers. Faith is hard.â",298,57,13:02:04
Ben Fickes,"So my the sermon was on the beginning of the school year (pastor Larry tried to make a generalizing statement to make it include non students but it seemed primarily for students). He talked about gratitude and said that âgratitude is wanting what you have.â And he talked about how as a society we donât do that and we canât understand wanting what we have because why would we want it if we have it? And he said âthis is on purpose. If everyone was grateful, our gdp would plummet. Why would we upgrade our phones or furniture or anything if we were content with what we have?â",591,108,13:00:57
Erica Yee,I actually woke up before my alarm went off at 8 but was too tired to get out of bed so just laid there for an hour lol. Should've gotten up but oh well,152,34,13:00:51
Ben Fickes,Kudos to you for still waking up early,38,8,12:58:22
Ben Fickes,Whoah good memory,17,3,12:58:04
Erica Yee,"And thanks, going to a 130 service which I'm not partial to but Julia thinks it's the greatest idea ever",104,20,12:35:44
Erica Yee,You did say you signed up after VBS (again because they never emailed me back before haha),90,17,12:35:21
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,12:35:00
Ben Fickes,Hope church is good for you!,28,6,12:33:32
Ben Fickes,Dbo came but the freshman did not,33,7,12:33:22
Ben Fickes,"It was good! Iâm on  way back now (stayed late for kids church meeting, did I tell you I was doing that?). Have some thoughts on the sermon Iâll send when I get back",169,34,12:33:15
Erica Yee,How was walking to ccfc and the new people?,43,9,12:12:29
Erica Yee,I thought I remembered Angela was there but maybe not,53,10,12:12:23
Erica Yee,No worries will find out soon,29,6,12:12:15
Ben Fickes,Idk sorry,9,2,12:11:30
Erica Yee,Is she with other IV people?,28,6,12:08:17
Erica Yee,Oh I knew that haha,19,5,12:08:04
Ben Fickes,I found out dbo is also on the second floor of Willis!,54,12,12:04:14
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,11:39:49
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,11:39:42
Ben Fickes,ðð,8,1,7:24:26
Ben Fickes,"Okay I thought of this (very bad) joke and wanted to share: youâll be here in two days, and âtwo daysâ is practically âtoday,â so itâs like youâll be here today",174,31,7:23:58
Ben Fickes,Playing HP is actually something I feel very strongly about. Jk yeah we can do something else,93,17,7:23:02
Erica Yee,Which is very fine. I just mentioned it as a possibility,56,11,0:35:03
Erica Yee,Lmao V is very against Harry Potter,35,7,0:34:55
Erica Yee,Wow full day,12,3,0:32:26
Ben Fickes,Back in my room,15,4,23:39:54
Ben Fickes,Just made it back - have to walk back to my apt with dan but no more driving haha,81,19,23:19:04
Ben Fickes,Byebye hope itâs good,23,4,23:05:28
Erica Yee,Show bye,8,2,23:05:00

Ben Fickes,Thank you so much ð,22,5,23:04:52
Erica Yee,He wanted to do 8th,19,5,23:04:30
Erica Yee,No I asked if we could do 15th,30,8,23:04:27
Ben Fickes,So 15th is uber good,20,5,23:03:31
Ben Fickes,Oh wait the 15th was when he wanted to hang out? Fun run is the 8th,67,16,23:03:21
Ben Fickes,"I love it haha, sounds good",27,6,23:03:05
Erica Yee,But imma put it in my calendar,30,7,23:00:37
Erica Yee,V really does not want to commit to the 15th lol,48,11,23:00:23
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good!,15,3,22:50:40
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm I feel like if we can get the kayak, the river is big enough that crowdedness doesnât matter",99,19,22:50:02
Ben Fickes,Yeah that sounds good to me :) I think Dara and molly have done it before (but if I made that up thatâs really awkward) so maybe I can ask one of them,152,33,22:49:38
Erica Yee,Or should we try to go on weekday so it's less crowded? ð¤,60,13,22:49:24
Erica Yee,Since it's something I've been really wanting to do. If that Saturday doesn't work we can try another,101,18,22:49:08
Erica Yee,Let's try kayaking if possible? Can see if we need res or something,67,13,22:48:45
Erica Yee,Lol I would love to do everything with you,42,9,22:48:15
Ben Fickes,Idk I was thinking we could kayak or do the island picnic. But if we donât have time to prep we can figure something else out,127,26,22:32:06
Ben Fickes,"Yes, everything",15,2,22:31:41
Erica Yee,Anything*,9,1,22:31:29
Erica Yee,Do you have everything in mind,30,6,22:31:25
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,22:30:59
Ben Fickes,Hope theyâre as big of a fan as I am,38,10,21:33:03
Erica Yee,Ok meeting fan now,18,4,21:32:45
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,21:32:40
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry like you and me us,29,7,21:32:22
Erica Yee,Wait like us,12,3,21:32:04
Ben Fickes,No worries if youâre busy though I know youâre just getting back,68,12,21:31:45
Ben Fickes,Do you wanna do something together this weekend? I guess Saturday,65,11,21:31:30
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,21:29:51
Ben Fickes,"Yes haha, we could do that with victor",38,8,21:29:34
Ben Fickes,Eh I can do Sunday after,24,6,21:29:24
Erica Yee,(side note: can we please beat the next level of the Harry Potter game sometime),80,15,21:29:22
Ben Fickes,If thereâs a walking group you could still come but no pressure,65,12,21:28:45
Erica Yee,Would you want to do something in the evening or is that too much for one day?,78,17,21:28:29
Erica Yee,Dang maybe I can run by then,28,7,21:28:14
Ben Fickes,He can come to that but guessing he wonât want to,51,11,21:27:58
Ben Fickes,So I agreed to do a fun run (and ice cream after) for IV at 3 that day. But besides that Iâm free,99,23,21:27:46
Ben Fickes,Lemme check,11,2,21:26:49
Erica Yee,Are you free Sunday 8th to hang with victor,43,9,21:26:25
Erica Yee,Yes! You are amazing,20,4,21:26:19
Ben Fickes,"Ah I see. So to recap, dinner 1 was Leahâs family and dinner 2 is bio family?",79,17,21:26:08
Erica Yee,"Oops sorry I meant ""more stressful"" as in dinner 2 will be stressful and dinner 1 wasn't cuz our families are close",115,22,21:25:35
Ben Fickes,That sounds like a compromise my family would agree to,54,10,21:25:10
Erica Yee,The other family paid for dinner and we're paying for show tickets,66,12,21:24:33
Ben Fickes,Hope dinner 2 is good,21,5,21:21:33
Ben Fickes,"1) Iâm so proud of you again
3) dang. So who ended up paying?",63,14,21:21:26
Erica Yee,But now onto dinner 2 and more stressful socializing,52,9,21:16:12
Erica Yee,"3b) later she announces to the whole restaurant ""I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM. REALLY, I AM!""",90,16,21:15:42
Erica Yee,"3) there was a huge fight over the bill that involved 4 venmo accounts and blocking each other. At one point my mom yells loudly in the small restaurant ""WE WILL NEVER GO OUT TO DINNER WITH YOU AGAIN""",200,39,21:15:01
Erica Yee,"2) Victor called me in the middle and I actually picked up and went outside cuz I was worried, but he just wanted to catch up",125,26,21:13:34
Erica Yee,1) near the end everyone else was full but i was still so hungry so then I ate 3/4 of the extra plate of noodles we ordered (and am still hungry),145,31,21:11:26
Erica Yee,Omg that was a wild dinner,26,6,21:08:49
Erica Yee,Yes good description,20,3,21:08:44
Ben Fickes,RenÃ©e played a song by her. Canât tell what sheâs saying but Joycelyn says itâs edgy middle schoolersâ music,117,19,19:56:38
Ben Fickes,I will haha. Have fun! :),25,6,19:54:26
Erica Yee,(or I'll explain later when I have time),40,8,19:54:05
Erica Yee,Time for dinner #1 ttyl,23,5,19:53:54
Erica Yee,?! Ask Renee to explain haha,28,6,19:53:44
Ben Fickes,Uh no haha,10,3,19:53:18
Ben Fickes,HAHA I love it,14,4,19:53:13
Erica Yee,Heard of her?,13,3,19:53:09
Erica Yee,What my friends and I call Billie Eilish,40,8,19:52:57
Erica Yee,Oh sorry,8,2,19:52:49
Ben Fickes,Whatâs William eyelash? And what makes it sad?,48,8,19:52:10
Erica Yee,Julia dj-ed washing the fridge and it was so depressing cuz she kept playing William eyelash,92,16,19:51:53
Erica Yee,Lol amazing,11,2,19:51:31
Ben Fickes,Now weâre listening to darude sandstorm,41,6,19:50:51
Ben Fickes,Weâve had everything from ccm to space jam to every time we touch,67,13,19:50:41
Ben Fickes,RenÃ©e has been dj-ing the car rides and itâs been tremendous,63,11,19:50:22
Erica Yee,Not tmi haha. Glad it was tremendously better,45,8,19:49:27
Ben Fickes,We got ice cream at the park and now weâre going to friendlys,63,13,19:47:45
Ben Fickes,It was really good! Idk if this is tmi and sorry if it is but the harness was super tight in the beginning and every time we hit a bump it felt like I was getting hit in the crotch. But after the first couple rides I moved my stuff from my normal pockets to my âextraâ cargo short pockets and that helped tremendously,321,64,19:47:32
Erica Yee,Yay how was it,14,4,19:45:38
Ben Fickes,"Leaving the park now. Rollercoasters didnât kill me, well see if dans driving does",84,14,19:44:33
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha haha, just curious",25,4,19:18:04
Erica Yee,Idk of that's why she likes him,31,7,19:16:40
Erica Yee,Hmm I guess she can be devious and sneak up on people haha,58,13,19:16:35
Ben Fickes,Does she have personality traits of junkrat?,44,7,18:57:26
Erica Yee,Omg junkrat has so much hair,28,6,18:57:19
Ben Fickes,I do appreciate haha,20,4,18:57:13
Erica Yee,I might not have time before meeting up with her fam though,59,12,18:54:36
Erica Yee,"(but the idea was formed with you in mind, please don't feel less appreciated haha)",83,15,18:53:03
Erica Yee,Was gonna make one for leah since I should have extra plastic,61,12,18:52:28
Erica Yee,Oh you right,12,3,18:51:46
Ben Fickes,Are you doing a junk rat one or just couldnât find it?,56,12,18:46:16
Ben Fickes,"Not sure but I think the one thatâs top row, one from the right",65,14,18:46:00
Erica Yee,Which one is junkrat,20,4,18:44:59
Erica Yee,That was the idea,17,4,18:44:42
Ben Fickes,Oooh I see we have each otherâs? Sorry I missed that but I like that even better,82,17,18:44:19
Erica Yee,The rein is for me (if it works) so maybe I will x),51,13,18:43:57
Ben Fickes,"Oh then I take it all back. Jk haha I will take rein in any color (even purple, if you wanted haha)",99,22,18:43:19
Erica Yee,Might have to make it all black,31,7,18:40:44
Erica Yee,Now onto Reinhardt..but don't have silver sharpie so uh,55,9,18:40:36
Erica Yee,You're welcome :),17,3,18:40:21
Ben Fickes,Once again thank you so much. That means so much to me that youâre willing to make these,90,18,18:37:46
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness thatâs amazing! Iâm sure thatâs the only reason haha,73,12,18:37:27
Erica Yee,(I didn't have orange sharpie...only reason her hair is purple ðð),72,11,18:36:10
Erica Yee,Omg it actually kinda worked,28,5,18:35:51
Erica Yee,That's what they teach us in j-school. Get exact quotes,55,10,18:35:33
Ben Fickes,I appreciate that you included the emoji in quoting her haha,60,11,18:34:01
Erica Yee,"My mom saw it and was like ""ð how many weird poses can your father have""",75,16,18:32:07
Ben Fickes,Also I appreciate your dad posing,33,6,18:30:18
Ben Fickes,I love it haha,14,4,18:30:12
Erica Yee,Also you can kinda see an ironing board table,45,9,18:23:00
Erica Yee,ðð yes,12,2,18:22:36
Ben Fickes,Because of all caps didnât realize it was literally âThe Storyâ until I zoomed in on it,93,17,18:18:39
Ben Fickes,"The Story!? Wow haha. Thanks for sharing, appreciate the pic",60,10,18:18:18
Erica Yee,The second book hahahhaa,24,4,18:12:14

Ben Fickes,Oh how was the show? Or is it later?,36,9,17:16:52
Erica Yee,Lool good to know,17,4,17:14:35
Ben Fickes,Apparently itâs the winner,28,4,17:07:58
Ben Fickes,Dara has tried the Popeyes one,30,6,17:07:53
Erica Yee,Omg the Popeyes Chick-fil-A internet war lol,44,7,16:55:34
Ben Fickes,Now you can compare it to Popeyes haha,38,8,16:35:09
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad you got to try it,28,7,16:34:57
Erica Yee,It is really good,17,4,16:25:35
Erica Yee,Oh I've been before haha. Julia was just craving (actually since you guys visited) and she can only go on Saturdays,115,21,16:25:16
Ben Fickes,Have you been before?,21,4,16:24:21
Ben Fickes,Glad you got to try,19,5,16:24:12
Ben Fickes,How was it then?,16,4,16:24:07
Ben Fickes,Oh wow,6,2,16:24:02
Erica Yee,Like it's a local favorite and almost legendary for how good the chicken is. it seems kinda quirky and scrappy but people show up cuz the food is great,151,29,16:23:24
Erica Yee,"Restaurant is a loose word. It's only open 11-2 mon-sat. There is no signage. When it's open, there's butcher paper menus taped on the wall. You takeout or eat outside on the sidewalk on ironing boards. There's a perpetual line and they usually run out before 2",261,47,16:21:24
Ben Fickes,What does very Oakland mean,27,5,16:21:10
Erica Yee,It's this very Oakland fried chicken restaurant,47,7,16:19:52
Erica Yee,Ooh you sent me the poster. Hope it goes well,45,10,16:19:39
Ben Fickes,What is bake sale Betty (from your snap),40,8,16:05:28
Ben Fickes,And random people not from usc found it so itâs bigger than they planned,74,14,15:59:36
Ben Fickes,He seems to be doing pretty well. Did I tell you he and his friend are hosting a game jam? Itâs today,103,22,15:59:05
Erica Yee,How's Josh doing btw,20,4,15:28:15
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,13:57:49
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,13:57:40
Ben Fickes,Jk haha thanks for sharing,26,5,13:56:28
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,13:56:16
Erica Yee,"""it's an easy way to end the conversation when you don't know how to""",69,14,13:55:30
Erica Yee,I asked my mom about the gif and emojis,39,9,13:55:12
Erica Yee,Yes and got it,14,4,13:17:04
Ben Fickes,Maybe your mom sending one will spark an interest,49,9,13:13:24
Ben Fickes,But Iâm not sure my mom knows what gifs are,45,10,13:13:13
Ben Fickes,To my mom? And I donât think so as far as I know,50,13,13:13:01
Erica Yee,How do you send on iOS? Is there a built-in GIF keyboard?,57,12,13:04:30
Erica Yee,I sent some emojis earlier haha,31,6,13:03:57
Ben Fickes,She doesnât know how to send gifs though,42,8,13:01:15
Ben Fickes,Funny isnât the right word but fun what is,44,9,13:01:08
Ben Fickes,If she were I think she would send emojis like that,51,11,13:00:53
Ben Fickes,I think sheâs not at the point where sheâs trying to be funny to you if that makes sense,92,19,13:00:42
Erica Yee,At least to me,14,4,12:59:10
Erica Yee,I feel like your mom texts very formally,40,8,12:59:08
Ben Fickes,She reminds me of how my mom texts haha,39,9,12:58:51
Erica Yee,What the,8,2,12:58:31
Ben Fickes,Your mom haha,13,3,12:58:14
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,12:58:12
Ben Fickes,"John: âare you wearing a fannypack?â
Me: âno, thatâs my stomach, Johnâ",80,12,12:55:02
Ben Fickes,Thanks I think itâll be good. Harness was unfortunately placed and tight which I think contributed to it,106,18,12:53:39
Ben Fickes,Idk it was a green one,22,6,12:53:22
Erica Yee,Probably same though lol. Hope you can enjoy the rest of the day,64,13,12:41:45
Erica Yee,What ride was it,16,4,12:41:28
Erica Yee,"""haha""",6,1,12:41:23

Erica Yee,ð®,4,1,12:16:09
Ben Fickes,He had some version of a talk with Ally and apparently it couldnât wait. So I had to wake him up and get him out of bed and was trying to make sure he didnât fall asleep at the wheel,186,40,12:15:41
Erica Yee,And omg lol,11,3,12:15:39

Erica Yee,What are you up to today,24,6,12:13:49
Erica Yee,But I gave up. It's too dark and preachy. The writer is more known for nonfiction cultural writing,98,18,12:02:42
Erica Yee,Fighting thanos while filling in for t'challa as queen,54,9,12:01:39

Erica Yee,"Omg this profile Calvin sent with the caption ""at some point you just have to make up your mind""",96,19,11:15:37
Erica Yee,I did wake up at 730 but didn't get out of bed till like 20 mins later,70,17,11:14:45

Erica Yee,Thanks for reading!,19,3,11:09:53
Erica Yee,Looool interesting. Julia wanted to do police forensics when she was younger,76,12,11:08:09
Ben Fickes,"At bfast John said ânow that youâre one of us, hereâs some things you should know about Asian culture.â Donât know if that was in reference to everyone else on the trip being Asian or us dating haha",208,38,10:11:26
Ben Fickes,"Read the article, thanks for sharing! Was very surprised about the Zach Williams part. Wish it said more about how the guy came to faith through the song though",160,29,8:20:52
Ben Fickes,It was really random and specific. I donât think it was a calling of what I should do but wanted to share. If it somehow is hopefully God will give me some other indication,174,34,7:41:17
Ben Fickes,"So I was meeting with a professor from NU and music from Xenoblade chronicles x was playing (specifically, the song that plays in your home base, New L.A.).
Prof: âyouâre going to grad school, right?â
Me: âuh my plan is actually to go into the industry. I always have the freedom to go to back to school.â
P: âoh really? Well I was going to say, if you go to grad school, you could work in police forensics. Unfortunately, the only one in the United States is *here*
He pointed to a map of the US (but Texas was the northernmost part of the map and there were states below it so idk what kinda map this was). Then I thought âoh thatâs right next to Oakland!â
And then I woke up haha",700,133,7:39:53

Erica Yee,Please tell Matt sorry and thank you. I should still buy a meal for him or something,84,17,20:06:22
Erica Yee,I cannot thank you enough. Such a relief,40,8,20:05:46
Ben Fickes,Also I didnât get a pic of the cellar but soooo many spiderwebs. Had to blow a spider off of one of your boxes,112,24,20:01:57
Ben Fickes,Just dropped off your stuff at your place!,42,8,20:00:25

Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Hope it goes well,26,6,19:10:06
Erica Yee,"We have the key, it's just a bit sketchy because we closed the bank account associated with it so we're technically getting it for free",135,25,19:08:16
Ben Fickes,I know they are,15,4,19:07:31
Erica Yee,Do you think the FBI is listening,33,7,19:07:11

Ben Fickes,So Iâm glad weâre âon the same wavelengthâ haha,55,9,18:33:00
Ben Fickes,So I always just say âneatoâ but fill in in my head âburritoâ after it,78,15,18:32:48
Ben Fickes,But I hear just âneatoâ sometimes,37,6,18:32:29
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you someone at Pivotal said that all the time?,57,12,18:32:17
Erica Yee,There's a gif keyboard in Google keyboard and I looked up burrito for neato burrito,83,15,18:31:55

Erica Yee,They're home and said you can pull into driveway,48,9,17:19:07
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad we could go together too! Itâs way too much sodium for my mom so we only lost like 10 bucks by them ending the deal,128,27,17:13:44
Erica Yee,Seriously. It was a great deal and I'm glad we got it,53,12,17:12:36
Erica Yee,I'm sorry for your loss,23,5,17:12:05
Ben Fickes,They got rid of the 420 burger deal at Boston burger ð¢,57,12,17:10:19
Ben Fickes,Of course! Happy to help in any way,35,8,17:10:04
Erica Yee,"My mom: how will they know which boxes?
Me: they also got the boxes for me LOL",78,17,16:44:52
Erica Yee,Thank you omg. I'm so grateful,30,6,16:44:19

Erica Yee,It's the address in JP,22,5,16:36:05
Erica Yee,"OK, trap door in floor of porch is heavy. It stays open though at the top. Light is on right next to basement door. Your stuff is all to the right once you enter the basement.

Erica Yee,Wow the fog tracker is actually up,34,7,13:35:41
Erica Yee,"The notifications are whack. If I ignore one, it'll keep coming back when other people DM me. Pics load very slowly. I don't like the aesthetic, too bubbly and spaced out. Things look like you can still view them when you can't",227,42,13:35:35
Ben Fickes,What annoys you about it?,25,5,13:23:37
Erica Yee,Indeed. Instagram's DM system (which tiff and Vanessa use more) annoys me so much,81,14,13:22:39
Ben Fickes,"Congrats haha, Iâm glad youâre living out your calling",58,9,12:57:49
Erica Yee,"Oh jk, only snaps from last 24 hours were there except saved ones. Which makes sense that they wouldn't save it all in their servers",132,25,12:48:08
Erica Yee,"She and Vanessa deleted it a few years ago but D, Olivia and I kept using the same groupchat that they're in haha. So she probably has thousands in backlog",155,30,12:41:24
Erica Yee,Daniella and I convinced Tiffany to re-download Snapchat and this is my greatest achievement in life,100,16,12:38:26
Erica Yee,"PATL ""pastor in Fresno""",23,4,12:12:38

Erica Yee,Ooh we should play together if someone has it,45,9,11:38:42
Ben Fickes,I played hanabi! It was really fun. Roger loves that game,57,11,9:17:55

Ben Fickes,I also have pretty bad posture,30,6,23:55:59
Ben Fickes,I know (solely in relation to poster!) I was just kidding haha,62,12,23:55:49

Ben Fickes,Please donât tell him I sent you that I just thought it was really funny,74,15,22:41:03
Ben Fickes,Jason just shouted âmy prostate hurtsâ when he died in super monkey ball,76,13,22:40:51
Ben Fickes,Do you have a favorite song from it?,36,8,21:43:39
Ben Fickes,Nice haha,9,2,21:43:31

Ben Fickes,Where does your aunt live? Matt is asking,41,8,20:52:17
Ben Fickes,Please,6,1,20:52:05
Ben Fickes,Okay gotcha. Well lemme know if he replies,42,8,20:52:02
Erica Yee,But my message might've come off a bit judgmental so idk if he's gonna respond,78,15,20:41:04
Erica Yee,I didn't see anyone else in the snap so I'm worried,51,11,20:40:51
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,20:40:40
Ben Fickes,From our gift card? At once? Is he okay?,40,9,20:31:07

Ben Fickes,Is he doing okay?,17,4,20:25:16
Ben Fickes,No worries haha,15,3,20:25:11

Erica Yee,"Are you free to talk tomorrow morning my time like 10:30? Could do later too, don't want to take time away from being with your mom",131,26,17:11:45
Erica Yee,Ooh interesting lol,19,3,17:01:19
Ben Fickes,Itâs pretty good! Weird thing but I like the hallways in the building haha. It feels a little small because you walk into the living area but itâs good. Dan and I have a weirdly shaped bedroom haha,201,38,16:59:10
Erica Yee,How is the new apartment?,25,5,16:57:56
Erica Yee,"No worries, glad you got your stuff over",40,8,16:57:52
Ben Fickes,"Sorry for the late reply, I was moving in. Iâm in the new place now, unpacking my stuff",89,18,16:55:41
Ben Fickes,If itâs all the same with you Iâd prefer if we didnât break up for 3 years though haha,92,19,16:55:17
Ben Fickes,And whoah thatâs crazy Iâd love to hear about it,52,10,16:54:54
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness you really are a journalism major because I really wanna know the rest of that story haha,104,20,16:54:41
Erica Yee,And then in the same conversation I learned more things about my mom and dad's break up that I never knew ... Like they were broken up for 3 or 4 years ð® could tell you a bit when we call,190,41,15:51:19
Erica Yee,Misleading headline to ATL: My mom just told me that someone asked if we were serious and she and my dad said different answers LOL,131,25,15:48:07
Erica Yee,Eh it's not too bothersome,26,5,15:47:04
Ben Fickes,"Oh didnât realize it still hurt, sorry",40,7,15:15:33
Erica Yee,It only hurts when I run or when I go down stairs so it's not bad,65,16,14:59:16
Erica Yee,Lol yes,7,2,14:58:58
Ben Fickes,âRunsâ haha,15,2,14:58:27

Erica Yee,"With, it didn't show a fracture",31,6,14:47:58
Ben Fickes,With or without an x Ray?,25,6,14:46:55
Erica Yee,"She was just like ""try not to trip again""",41,9,14:43:43
Erica Yee,Ok I'm fine,11,3,14:43:34
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well thatâs annoying but hopefully itâs all good,63,10,14:39:25
Erica Yee,No it's just from the sprain in June still,42,9,14:38:02
Erica Yee,I fell for you,14,4,14:37:45
Ben Fickes,Oh no what happened?,20,4,14:33:24
Erica Yee,Ugh I have to get an x-ray for my foot,38,10,14:07:06
Erica Yee,Yah think so,12,3,14:06:54
Ben Fickes,I will tell you on the phone but it wasnât really a yes for right now. And I know haha. Did they start when we were in nyc?,125,28,13:43:55
Erica Yee,Wait they haven't even been dating that long lol,48,9,13:32:36
Erica Yee,What did he say ð®,20,5,13:32:27
Ben Fickes,Oh I didnât tell you this yet but I overheard someone asking Sam if he was gonna get engaged soon. Which seems so weird to me haha,132,27,13:19:39
Ben Fickes,I think she leaving sometime tomorrow,37,6,13:19:06
Erica Yee,How long is she staying,23,5,13:17:02
Erica Yee,Oh nice haha,12,3,13:16:59
Ben Fickes,My mom is coming up to help haha,32,8,13:15:19
Ben Fickes,"Iâm looking forward to it! And thanks, me too",47,9,13:15:13
Erica Yee,I hope moving in goes smoothly,30,6,13:14:49
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I'm sure I'll snap a lot",32,7,13:14:35
Ben Fickes,Aw thatâs awesome! I hope you have a great time,49,10,13:13:23
Erica Yee,"Then driving out to Daniella's house for final hangout with all of us, gonna cook dinner",88,16,13:11:56
Ben Fickes,Just remind her she gets to appreciate your beautiful skin and sheâll forgive you,83,14,13:11:18
Erica Yee,"Now on the way to doctor's appointment, time for my pediatrician to hate me for still seeing her at 22",102,20,13:09:58
Ben Fickes,Iâd love that! Thanks for thinking of me to share it :),57,12,13:09:41
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad haha. I like your skin too (and many things about you beside your skin haha),87,17,13:09:29
Erica Yee,"Think you'd like it, or at least appreciate the lyrics",54,10,13:08:07
Erica Yee,"Just went to the gym. Was listening to this song that I really liked in high school, and I might send a post script email about it if it's ok",141,30,13:07:56
Erica Yee,Lol ?? I like your skin,23,6,13:06:48
Ben Fickes,What are you up to today?,25,6,12:50:26
Ben Fickes,About to go back on the bus back to Boston,42,10,12:50:20
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. People were discussing whether my skin looks good or not,67,12,12:50:07
Erica Yee,Lol what about it,17,4,12:39:57
Erica Yee,She's home for the week,23,5,12:39:53
Ben Fickes,Clearly everyone is tired,25,4,12:27:04
Ben Fickes,Somehow my skin became topic of discussion at lunch for two minutes,67,12,12:27:00
Ben Fickes,Wait isnât Sophie there?,26,4,12:26:42
Erica Yee,Mary (NOT MAYA) is moving in today so it's just gonna be her and Barbara till next week lol,91,19,11:20:44
Erica Yee,"And you're welcome, it's worth",30,5,11:19:42
Erica Yee,Aw I'm glad it was good talking,31,7,11:19:34
Ben Fickes,Oh i also wanted to say I appreciate the effort you go through (2 hours on the phone) to let us spend thanksgiving together haha,128,25,10:37:03
Ben Fickes,Also I just talked with Emily about her mom some. It was actually really good. She says she hasnât met someone besides me whoâs lost a parent so Iâm glad we could talk,173,33,9:28:03
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much Erica :) I miss you too. But Iâll see you in five days!!!,77,17,9:25:52
Erica Yee,I miss you so much. Hope you rest well tonight,46,10,0:30:02
Erica Yee,"I got the flights after almost 2 hours. First arrives in Philly 20 mins after yours, second departs about an hour before.",121,22,0:27:19
Erica Yee,"Dang it's hard for me to grasp that you can see things in me that I can't see in myself. I often don't see God's love in myself, and it's usually like I feel I could never get to the sacrificial love that Jesus calls us to. But I know He gives me His Spirit and people like you, especially you, to keep drawing me closer to Him. And hopefully that will show outwardly. It's work, but it's not works.",399,80,0:24:36
Ben Fickes,"You are truly, truly incredible. When I think of you itâs not just âErica is pretty goodâ or âErica is really niceâ or âErica is really pretty,â thereâs something much deeper. I donât know where this imagery is coming from (probably my sleepy mind) but itâs not just like you have a splash or sprinkling of Christian atmosphere, but I imagine roots of Gods love extending from your heart throughout all of you. And it would be sinful of me to think of you as perfect, not to mention it would give you no space to grow our relationship, and youâre not perfect haha. But you love God and you care about God, and I feel like that is the ultimate difference in everything. Because you care about growing and you care about God and you care about people. And I see all of this and I remember that you are with me on my journey and Iâm overwhelmed with gratitude. And in all my âstorminessâ of worry and overthinking and fears, you tell me itâs okay and you are with me. And of course I always want to draw closer to God and follow Him in every aspect of my life. But the fact that I donât have to do that alone, but can have you with me in that, still blows my mind. So thank you so much. I wish I could communicate everything I feel and how much I love you and all that is beyond my thoughts. But please just know that I am grateful to you and grateful to God to have you in my life",1410,271,0:02:06
Erica Yee,Phone,5,1,23:55:19
Erica Yee,No dude you're amazing,22,4,23:53:42
Ben Fickes,"I also feel like that even though we focus on you affirming me a lot, I donât affirm you enough. Iâm feeling a lot right now so Iâm going to type it out before I sleep",173,36,23:50:12
Ben Fickes,"And I appreciate all your affirmations so much, and I can see you trying (though thereâs probably more than I see or appreciate) and it means so much to me",157,30,23:49:39
Ben Fickes,"I will definitely let you know if I need space, and Iâm sure there will be times where I will and I appreciate you recognizing that. I feel that usually I long for companionship and having someone else to share with, and I believe thatâs exactly what you do when you listen and offer support and simply be with me. And it blows my mind that you, even not having gone through all the same things that I go through, can offer such unhesitant companionship and extend love to me in my brokenness",496,93,23:48:50
Ben Fickes,My first thought after reading this is that you are amazing and I am so thankful for you,88,18,23:45:55
Erica Yee,"Also you're welcome for the affirmation. Like I said earlier, I don't say things like that enough to show you my appreciation. Sometimes I have a fleeting thought that if I do the opposite extreme and affirm ""too much"" (as if that's possible) it won't mean as much. But I'm trying to disregard that insidious reasoning. Because you mean so much to me and I can never tell you enough. So of course I'm gonna mess up and forget and be lazy, but I am trying",454,86,23:34:46
Erica Yee,"Thank you for sharing all of that. I want you to know that even though I don't know exactly what you feel, I want to be there for you in any way than I can. If you need space, please let me know. If you need me to listen, I'm here. You know I'm so bad at externally expressing empathy so please keep telling me what you need from me and I will do my best",354,76,23:29:57
Erica Yee,"You are forgiven. By me and more importantly by God, who knows more than I ever could about how you feel and feels it too",121,25,23:26:04
Ben Fickes,And Iâm gonna shower so brb,29,6,23:24:00
Ben Fickes,"Thanks for listening, I know youâre on the phone haha",55,10,23:21:50
Ben Fickes,And it didnât really come to mind until Emily brought it up,61,12,23:21:38
Ben Fickes,"And I think itâs that, even though I never (to my knowledge) have acted on it, I sometimes feel a dark desire when I am feeling very alone in hurt of missing my dad or feeling not affirmed or what have you, I never feel âI wish this happened to Erica,â but at times I feel âI wish Erica could also feel this and know what it feels like.â Which is selfish and prideful and wrong and I wanted to ask forgiveness for it and apologize",440,86,23:21:26
Ben Fickes,And I cannot think of a time I have ever done something to hurt you when I feel hurt or any negative emotion but the sentiment felt familiar to me and I was trying to think why,176,37,23:16:54
Ben Fickes,Other thought from when I prayed with Emily: she was talking about how she doesnât share her emotions. And I said I resonated with that and sometimes I get really moody rather than saying whatâs on my mind. And she said âI do that all the time with Andrew. And itâs hard because heâs never lost his mom and I feel like I act moody because I want to hurt him so that he feels and understands what Iâm feelingâ,422,80,23:16:20
Ben Fickes,"So first thought is not related to our convo but I wanted to say thank you so much for the affirmation today, like saying âthank you for caring.â That really really means a lot and your words are very precious to me",219,42,23:13:32
Ben Fickes,"But will share what thoughts I have now, now",44,9,23:11:34
Ben Fickes,So Iâm gonna talk with Emily at bfast,39,8,23:11:25
Ben Fickes,We literally just finished the planning,39,6,23:11:15
Ben Fickes,Sheâs a sophomore,19,3,23:11:06
Ben Fickes,Sheâs probably one of two so maybe Lisa too,45,9,23:11:02
Erica Yee,What year is sabrina,20,4,23:10:55
Erica Yee,Not Lisa? Interesting,21,3,23:10:48
Erica Yee,?!,2,1,23:10:38
Ben Fickes,Fun run is me,13,4,23:10:25
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha, I appreciate it. Looks like it, I think Sabrina (not Sabrina Chan) is leading it",97,18,23:10:20
Erica Yee,Ooh women's is gonna be Sunday again?,37,7,23:08:56
Erica Yee,Sorry sorry I'm literally just reading it to you,48,9,23:07:48
Erica Yee,Ooh worship jam,15,3,23:07:39
Erica Yee,Omg yes soccer,14,3,23:07:16
Erica Yee,Are you the fun run?,20,5,23:06:53
Erica Yee,Ooh picnic,10,2,23:06:49
Erica Yee,I am still waiting to talk to a live person,43,10,23:06:14
Ben Fickes,Current plan for nso,20,4,23:00:12
Ben Fickes,Will do haha,12,3,22:29:56
Erica Yee,Time to be on the phone for 2 hours go use my Delta credits. Please pray for customer service mercies,101,20,22:23:12
Erica Yee,Ok whenever he gets back,24,5,22:12:26
Ben Fickes,Oh but I forget idk when Matt will get off work,47,11,22:10:42
Ben Fickes,"Yeah, or if it starts at 6 we could get it before and eat and/or unpack after",77,17,22:10:26
Erica Yee,Oh like we can get it after?,28,7,22:05:51
Ben Fickes,Quick note on ice cream social: theyâre going to try to be done by 7 (no idea when it starts). So that may help with you getting your stuff,141,29,22:03:58
Erica Yee,"No rush, don't want to distract you from being present",54,10,21:23:13
Ben Fickes,Still have thoughts to share but we have campus time in ten minutes so it will be a bit until then,98,21,21:20:51
Ben Fickes,"Thank you for sharing all that description, I appreciate it :)",62,11,21:20:31
Erica Yee,Also looks like Asian female conductor which is awesome,55,9,19:20:10
Erica Yee,During the first song it seemed like Hamilton was trying too hard to sing on beat and it felt stilted. But as he got into it it was much better. All the girls' voices were incredible,182,36,19:17:54
Erica Yee,Most of the choreography was really cool and complemented it,60,10,19:04:55
Erica Yee,Also mind-blown that this stuff actually happened (in some shape or form),73,12,19:04:36
Erica Yee,Mostly that I'm so glad I knew the songs pretty well beforehand or else I would have had such a hard time following it,118,24,19:04:07
Ben Fickes,Do you have any specific thoughts on it? Glad you liked it!,59,12,19:00:36
Erica Yee,"Just finished, so good",22,4,18:56:27
Erica Yee,I remember it was while I was in discrete haha,46,10,18:56:23
Erica Yee,And yeah they saw it through the lottery,40,8,18:56:07
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good,14,3,18:55:53
Ben Fickes,Because he remembers it and asked me if it happened and I said I didnât know,78,16,18:54:52
Ben Fickes,Jason wants to know if your parents have ever won the Hamilton lottery,70,13,18:54:36
Ben Fickes,Kinda hard to explain but I talked to Emily briefly about her mom when we had prayer time at our rotation. She brought up something I wanted to talk to you about but Iâm still formulating thoughts and weâre going to talk later. So I will probably have something to send later haha,284,53,18:52:14
Ben Fickes,HAHA that would be awkward to explain,37,7,18:38:06
Erica Yee,I wanna hear it all,19,5,17:21:25
Ben Fickes,I guess I can always talk on the way though and just hang up for the five minutes I return the key,98,22,16:13:40
Ben Fickes,Oh I do have to return my work key on Friday,44,11,16:13:37
Ben Fickes,"Iâll see you on the other side, til we meet again",51,11,15:49:10
Erica Yee,Ok talk to you on the other side,32,8,15:48:52
Erica Yee,Me and Snapchat in the Bart tunnel omg,38,8,15:48:38
Ben Fickes,Wow I can receive your messages but mine arenât sending,57,10,15:46:30
Ben Fickes,Spoiler warning but the ending is pretty sad,44,8,15:46:30
Erica Yee,But thanks :P,13,3,15:45:45
Erica Yee,I hear he's not good by the end,31,8,15:45:40
Ben Fickes,Hope Hamilton is good!,22,4,15:44:52
Ben Fickes,Aw thanks Erica ð,20,4,15:43:43
Erica Yee,I'm actually very impressed at the reception you've been getting compared to my experiences at toah nipi #blessup,113,18,15:42:45
Erica Yee,Try to do*,10,3,15:42:17
Erica Yee,Lol you are one of few people I will happily do crafts for,58,13,15:41:06
Ben Fickes,Please no pressure again haha,29,5,15:40:50
Erica Yee,Ok I will try to make them sometime this week,45,10,15:40:36
Erica Yee,I like your weird,17,4,15:40:07
Ben Fickes,Also very bad reception so sorry if I reply slowly or at weird times,68,14,15:36:05
Ben Fickes,Haha no pressure at all! I would love one but donât wanna put more on your plate,82,17,15:36:05
Ben Fickes,No idea when but sometime,25,5,15:36:05
Ben Fickes,"If you ever want to, I would love to still make those at some point",67,15,15:36:05
Ben Fickes,Wow thatâs really good,24,4,15:35:49
Ben Fickes,"Awww oh my goodness thatâs so amazing, I love that idea. I do think we have some of their personalities (though youâre not morally ambiguous haha)",150,26,15:34:05
Erica Yee,I may still try to make them but it probably won't turn out great because we don't have the right color sharpies lol,116,23,15:32:39
Erica Yee,And I try to show love (healing) with sarcasm (shooting people) ((ok this one is more or a stretch)),100,19,15:31:37
Erica Yee,"Cuz you're a protector (I think we talked about this in NY) and are willing to ""charge"" (i.e. volunteer) for things",115,21,15:31:10
Erica Yee,Ok anyway I saw online that you could DIY them with a certain type of plastic takeout boxes and color with sharpies. So I collected a bunch of boxes and was going to make Reinhardt and Moira silhouettes (keychains?) because I feel like aspects of their personalities match ours and we would each have the other's,312,56,15:30:15
Ben Fickes,You just failed Hamiltonâs,28,4,15:29:25
Ben Fickes,You havenât failed your generation,36,5,15:29:25
Erica Yee,I feel like I've failed my generation,37,7,15:26:13
Erica Yee,A guy asked me to take pics of his family in front of the poster but I didn't notice I cut off Hamilton's head so I had to do them again,136,31,15:26:07
Ben Fickes,I did do shrinky dinks when I was little but only once or twice I think,71,16,15:17:37
Erica Yee,"Onesec, walking",15,2,15:16:38
Erica Yee,I feel like it was more of a girl thing lol,43,11,15:16:30
Erica Yee,Did you ever do shrinky dinks,29,6,15:16:21
Ben Fickes,Yeah,4,1,15:14:39
Ben Fickes,Aw can you tell me what it was? Unless you think itâll happen in the future,77,16,15:14:38
Erica Yee,Can I just tell you what it is and it's the thought that counts,63,14,15:14:26
Erica Yee,No,2,1,15:14:17
Erica Yee,Ugh I don't think it's gonna happen at this point,49,10,15:14:12
Erica Yee,I just remembered*,18,3,15:14:05
Erica Yee,Omg I just forgot about the thing I was gonna make and send you,63,14,15:14:00
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you about the first time I wrote a letter and had to put down your address,85,19,15:13:58
Ben Fickes,I did indeed haha,17,4,15:13:42
Erica Yee,Haha you did write it a bunch,29,7,15:13:29
Ben Fickes,I donât remember your area code,33,6,15:13:26
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,15:13:20
Erica Yee,My mom's pager that she hasn't used in more than 5 years,56,12,15:13:14
Ben Fickes,I remember your address I think,31,6,15:13:14
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs impressive,24,3,15:13:07
Erica Yee,For Oakland,11,2,15:12:57
Erica Yee,My old library card,19,4,15:12:54
Erica Yee,The addresses of all my close friends,37,7,15:12:44
Ben Fickes,Not to brag but I can count pretty well,39,9,15:12:43
Ben Fickes,What are some numbers you remember,34,6,15:12:25
Ben Fickes,I guess it can be like the lore quiz - actual facts that you have no way of knowing,83,19,15:12:15
Erica Yee,I do like remembering numbers,29,5,15:12:15
Ben Fickes,Though I guess that takes out the fun of it,43,10,15:11:37
Ben Fickes,But if you played a ton you would know it all,45,11,15:11:29
Ben Fickes,I can imagine it driving you crazy haha,39,8,15:11:20
Erica Yee,"I feel like betting on wild guesses for a fact that can actually be known (unlike, say, poker) would drive me crazy",115,22,15:10:40
Erica Yee,"Do you know the average number of pizza slices eaten by Americans each day? Of course not! Thatâs the fun. No one knows the answers, but everyone can take a guess. The felt betting mat and different payout odds will make you feel like a Vegas high roller. Get lucky and youâll cheer like you hit the jackpot! Feeling confident? Bet on yourself. Think others know better? Bet on them. No idea? Bet on any guess and hope to get lucky.",436,81,15:09:17
Erica Yee,Idk how I feel about the description:,37,7,15:09:13
Erica Yee,The family friend who's running the conference my dad is at recommended it to him,81,15,15:09:06
Ben Fickes,I have not heard of it,22,6,15:07:14
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much,17,4,15:07:09
Ben Fickes,Aw thank you so much Erica. I love messaging you too,52,11,15:07:03
Erica Yee,Have you heard of the game wits and wagers,42,9,15:06:49
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,15:06:27
Erica Yee,You're welcome for the above thing. Even messaging you is the favorite part of my day,85,16,15:06:22
Ben Fickes,We should have time before your appointment,43,7,15:03:58
Ben Fickes,Haha I look forward to hearing this story,41,8,15:03:29
Erica Yee,Then in the evening we have to go get tickets for the show Saturday since youth need to be in person to get discount so we're taking decoys and it's a whole complicated mess that I will tell you about on the phone,213,43,15:03:02
Ben Fickes,And including me in your life,29,6,15:03:01
Ben Fickes,Thank you for your care and attention and willingness to talk and listen and spend time with me,95,18,15:02:56
Ben Fickes,"Thank you so much Erica, that made my day ð",46,10,15:02:40
Erica Yee,Actually seriously though. I don't tell you that enough,55,9,15:02:08
Erica Yee,Thank you for your care,23,5,15:01:57
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, Iâm sure we can work around that haha",47,9,15:01:07
Ben Fickes,I sent that because I care,26,6,15:00:57
Erica Yee,Only thing I have for sure is DMV appointment at 3 my time,58,13,15:00:46
Ben Fickes,Whaaaaaaat!?!?!? letâs do it,30,4,15:00:20
Erica Yee,Daytime call?!?!?!,18,2,15:00:08
Ben Fickes,So I could do then!,19,5,15:00:05
Ben Fickes,Iâm moving in tomorrow when I get back unfortunately. But I have nothing at all Friday I think,96,18,14:59:57
Erica Yee,Omg so cute,11,3,14:59:40
Erica Yee,And then we both don't have work Friday! But don't you have something? I forgot sorry,85,16,14:59:27
Erica Yee,Still figuring out if I'm doing dinner with friends Thursday or Friday. But depending on when you get back tomorrow maybe we could talk then,140,25,14:58:43
Ben Fickes,My cousin recently had a baby,29,6,14:47:00
Ben Fickes,If youâre not free at all thatâs okay though,48,9,14:46:03
Ben Fickes,Idk when Iâll be free but just wondering when you are,55,11,14:45:52
Ben Fickes,Any time work in the next few days?,35,8,14:45:40
Ben Fickes,Aw dang,7,2,14:45:23

Erica Yee,Wow shoot was unintentionally actually the right word,53,8,14:33:14
Erica Yee,Oh shoot lol,12,3,14:33:03
Ben Fickes,"They wonât teach you this in your classes, but look it up, he was wearing his glasses",87,17,14:30:33
Erica Yee,I'm bringing glasses in case I cry my contacts out,50,10,14:26:24

Erica Yee,Ah wow and and ok,17,5,13:37:37
Ben Fickes,"Gonna go for a walk, brb",24,6,13:36:07
Ben Fickes,Ty was pretty dug in that summit is unnecessary and could be distilled into something shorter. And people were saying that that might be better for ty but not for everyone else. And ty said he shouldnât be expected to go to something that isnât whatâs best for him. It was something along those lines,306,55,13:35:42
Ben Fickes,Iâm not sure honestly,23,4,13:34:22
Erica Yee,Do you think it ended ok,24,6,13:33:19
Erica Yee,And oh man,10,3,13:33:13
Erica Yee,It is! Good memory,18,4,13:33:06
Ben Fickes,Ty conversation got pretty heated and long actually. Everyone has dispersed now,79,12,13:32:41
Ben Fickes,Is Hamilton today?,18,3,13:32:02
Erica Yee,ðð noted,14,2,13:31:17
Ben Fickes,I feel like ânooooo pressureâ is what I expect more. So idk if I like that better or the other one because itâs more unique to you haha,141,28,13:29:46
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð they are both beautiful,33,6,13:29:02
Erica Yee,Yes Ruth please though,22,4,13:29:01
Erica Yee,Out of the no pressures haha,28,6,13:28:40
Ben Fickes,Out of those two? Probably the Ruth one but itâs a story for you so itâs your call,86,18,13:28:16
Erica Yee,I think I like elongation over repetition,41,7,13:28:16
Erica Yee,Which one do you like better,28,6,13:27:55
Ben Fickes,I did promise you a story,25,6,13:27:53
Erica Yee,Nooooo pressure,15,2,13:27:50
Ben Fickes,Not sure when but I will haha,29,7,13:27:49
Erica Yee,No no no pressure,17,4,13:27:44
Ben Fickes,Do you want me to write that? Like is that the final answer? I will for sure if thatâs what youâd like,106,22,13:27:37
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs right,17,3,13:27:18
Erica Yee,Nah I'd rather hear more about Ruth,35,7,13:19:36
Erica Yee,It's a bit dated lol,20,5,13:18:18
Ben Fickes,I would probably have to watch the movie first though,53,10,13:17:20
Ben Fickes,But I do owe you a story and would gladly write it,50,12,13:17:08
Ben Fickes,I do not know anything about prince Phillip,43,8,13:16:59
Erica Yee,He gets this sword of truth and shield of virtue that come out of nowhere but I was really into cuz it sounded like the armor of God,132,28,13:16:18
Erica Yee,Actually I really want a backstory for his weapons of righteousness,67,11,13:15:22
Erica Yee,What if I asked you to write a story about prince phillip,57,12,13:15:11
Ben Fickes,Just completing your verse,26,4,13:14:48
Ben Fickes,"âWhen you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd,â
â­â­Exodusâ¬ â­23:2â¬b",120,18,13:14:42
Ben Fickes,Iâve said the worst thing possible to upset you,49,9,13:13:31
Ben Fickes,Oh no,5,2,13:13:21
Erica Yee,Hey he's real in my heart,25,6,13:13:10
Ben Fickes,Jk but thanks for sharing haha,30,6,13:11:28
Ben Fickes,Wow I never told you but my greatest insecurity was that you would leave me for a fictional Disney prince. Now I feel so much relief,132,26,13:11:22
Erica Yee,Lol sorry random but,20,4,13:09:31
Erica Yee,My favorite thing to do with the Bible,38,8,13:08:58
Erica Yee,I cut out the second part lol,29,7,13:08:52
Ben Fickes,Gonna look up that verse,24,5,13:08:44
Ben Fickes,Wow throwing in the a,21,5,13:08:36
Erica Yee,"âYou must not follow the crowd in doing wrong.""
Exodus 23:2a",63,11,13:07:42
Erica Yee,Yeah I get that,15,4,13:07:26
Ben Fickes,I always appreciate Tyâs viewpoints but I can tell itâs wearing people down too,83,14,13:07:12
Ben Fickes,Heâs been very contrarian (for lack of a better word) for all of summit,73,14,13:06:50
Ben Fickes,His skepticism reminds me a lot of Katie,40,8,13:06:30
Erica Yee,Lol what ok,11,3,13:05:41
Ben Fickes,Ty is leading a theological discussion/debate about what it means to be hipster (in general) as a Christian,107,18,13:04:19
Ben Fickes,Wow now I have another reason to be proud of my home state,58,13,13:03:50
Erica Yee,Delaware is the leader of unclaimed gift cards,46,8,13:03:28
Ben Fickes,Why am I the leader and of what,31,8,13:02:54
Erica Yee,Idk how they could write this without mentioning venmo but oh well,66,12,13:02:05
Erica Yee,You're the leader,17,3,13:01:51
Erica Yee,Unclaimed gift cards LOL,24,4,13:01:25
Ben Fickes,Though I will read it later,27,6,13:01:07
Ben Fickes,Whatâs it about,17,3,13:01:01
Erica Yee,Lol it's actually pretty boring (to me) but I was just so surprised to see Delaware,83,16,12:54:30
Erica Yee,Wow I trusted you,17,4,12:54:13
Ben Fickes,"Also thanks for the email, I look forward to checking it out",60,12,12:52:55
Ben Fickes,When California runs out of water Iâll show the authorities this text,71,12,12:52:43
Erica Yee,So I had to water the plants since my dad is away but I could not figure out how to use the hose at first so I spoiled them with kitchen faucet water,149,33,12:41:55
Erica Yee,Thanks for inviting me :),25,5,12:41:09
Ben Fickes,Just did! And oh awesome! Ofc no pressure to get there but I am happy for all the time you get to spend in Delaware for thanksgiving,132,27,12:36:06
Erica Yee,Completely,10,1,12:25:44
Erica Yee,There's a flight that gets in 8:41 Tuesday which is perf so guess I'm just blowing off my class complel9,104,20,12:25:41
Erica Yee,"Also apparently I have flight credits from our cancelled trip to Raleigh in May because of death in the family, so I will use that for Thanksgiving",147,27,12:25:13
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah PATL ""in real life"", it's this book I just read. No deep thoughts but the plot is mildly interesting",108,21,12:20:22
Erica Yee,ð®,4,1,12:19:44
Ben Fickes,Oh not much to say now but Calvin came up when I was doing listening prayer. Will talk more over phone but wanted to let you know,129,27,11:59:36
Ben Fickes,"Haha I appreciate hearing your thought process behind it, thank you",67,11,11:55:59
Erica Yee,"Ok yesterday I was repeating ""I'm gonna send 'less than one week' tomorrow"" as a mantra so I wouldn't forget. But I realize now I could've just sent ""one week"" yesterday... Idk why I was so set on ""less than one week""",217,42,11:40:54
Erica Yee,Thanks for sharing,18,3,11:39:38
Erica Yee,Aww Dara,8,2,11:39:32
Erica Yee,Oh I was just listening to it,29,7,11:38:00
Ben Fickes,"We sang âanother in the fireâ again this morning (but skipped the part I really liked, oh well). And we shared in small groups and I was with Dara and Justin. And Dara started crying when I shared about my dad and what it brought up for me. And that just meant a lot to me and I wanted to share",298,61,11:31:50
Ben Fickes,Iâm very excited :),21,4,11:30:48
Ben Fickes,Thatâs a great mindset to have :) and I was gonna send yesterday âone week until I see you againâ but didnât for some reason,132,25,11:30:42
Erica Yee,Less than a week till I see you again :),40,10,11:14:01
Erica Yee,Lol Sam omg,11,3,11:13:50
Erica Yee,And don't really feel worried because I know there will be more opportunities to work at building community even if I have to work a little harder at it,152,29,11:13:33
Erica Yee,Oh that didn't even cross my mind. I have no idea haha,54,12,11:12:59
Ben Fickes,"Sam: âare you... *pause* still in a relationship? With...â
Me: âyeah Iâm still dating Erica.â
Sam: âcool. Wanted to ask indirectly but didnât know how so I asked you directly instead.â
Sam: âI approveâ",221,34,9:00:07
Ben Fickes,"And ofc though it was dark so to be fair I mightâve been wrong, just what it looked like in the dim light",107,23,8:31:41
Ben Fickes,Do you think this has to do at all with love language? Probably me seeing a false connection when I see the word âservingâ God. And do you feel worried at all or have thoughts on what next semester will be like? Since youâll be probably not able to make most IV stuff,273,53,8:31:05
Erica Yee,"Omg lol about the couple. thanks so much for sharing, you know I love juicy Christian ""gossip."" Hope you could still concentrate though",135,23,23:29:12
Erica Yee,Wow thanks this helped me process it more,41,8,23:26:40
Erica Yee,"But I've heard the Spirit (or it might just be me but I think it's the Spirit) remind me that checking out churches with my friends and sister is serving God. And even if I didn't do that, my worth is in my identity as a child of God which is already a done thing",263,55,23:26:24
Erica Yee,And a big part of how I see my faith grow and be challenged is in by serving in those kinds of communities,106,23,23:21:30
Erica Yee,Ok anyway so it's bc I wasn't serving directly in a church or IV this summer.,77,16,23:20:18
Erica Yee,I'd like it if we talked when I was back ð,45,11,23:11:35
Ben Fickes,Also slight chance I will be asleep or have no reception when you reply so if so Iâll reply in the morning,108,22,23:03:57
Ben Fickes,"Okay no worries either way, even if nothing works out we can talk when youâre back",84,16,23:03:10
Erica Yee,"One sec about other stuff, doing dishes",39,7,23:00:32
Erica Yee,Ok I will try let you know if Thurs or Fri work and you're still free but things are supposed to be happening if people reply (wow sorry English teachers),154,30,22:59:51
Ben Fickes,Unrelated but I went outside to pray and did but now a couple is making out on the picnic tables a little bit in front of me and itâs kinda killing the prayer vibe,165,34,22:49:12
Ben Fickes,"If you donât mind me asking, what do you mean by feeling useless?",67,13,22:48:31
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey sounds good. I have an event but hopefully itâll be done early enough (especially with time difference) that I can talk,131,22,22:48:09
Erica Yee,Sunday's probably best bet at this point,40,7,22:42:54
Erica Yee,Urgh so my schedule is kinda in flux rn because trying to jam in hangouts,73,15,22:39:31
Erica Yee,Thank you for saying that about my faith and serving. I'm honestly feeling kinda useless this summer when though I know in my head my salvation is not based on anything I do,173,33,22:38:42
Ben Fickes,I can do Thursday night or Friday. Maybe Sunday evening,55,10,22:31:55
Ben Fickes,Do you have a preference for when youâd want to talk? If youâre still free,78,15,22:31:43
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha haha,14,3,22:31:09
Erica Yee,(ok in this case yes but also because I was finishing dinner and had to look something up in my phone which is why I saw your messages lol),139,29,22:29:50
Ben Fickes,"And I donât mind at all that it takes you so long to reply haha, I know it means that you  are putting thought into it",120,26,22:28:29
Ben Fickes,"Thank you Erica, that means a lot to me. And I hope I have said this enough but I also am astounded by the way you have faith and serve God",139,31,22:28:05
Erica Yee,Your faith seriously blows my mind,34,6,22:27:25
Erica Yee,(sorry I'm taking forever to type things),41,7,22:27:16
Erica Yee,"God was there in the fire, and that is amazing to me that you can have that outlook in this tragedy",99,21,22:27:05
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah I left that part out on accident but yeah I believe it is from that part,80,18,22:23:30
Erica Yee,"Ah yes. âLook!â Nebuchadnezzar shouted. âI see four men, unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god !â
Daniel 3:25",158,26,22:22:49
Erica Yee,"This might be what you were saying (sorry if so), but the ""there is another in the fire"" line is from that Daniel passage right?",128,25,22:21:53
Erica Yee,"Oh wow. Thanks for sharing, that's really powerful",50,8,22:20:45
Ben Fickes,"And an aside is that I thought about the story of shadrach, meshach, and abendago (sorry on spelling) in the fire. And they say âeven if God does not save us, we will not bow to your godâ or something like that (sorry going from memory). And I thought about how three people died in the fire that killed my dad and maybe that is the âeven ifâ",350,68,22:16:59
Ben Fickes,"So the story is that we sang a song called âThere is another in the fire.â And (part of) the refrain is something like:
âI hear heaven roar
As the space between wears thin
I feel the ground begin to shake
As the prison walls cave in
There is another in the fire
Standing here with meâ
And I thought about my dad singing that. Because the walls literally caved in on him, and he died in the fire. But I imagined him singing it as he was dying. And I hope he felt Gods presence in it. And he mention of this world as a prison made me think that, no matter how much I wish he were here, heâs in a better place",616,125,22:07:45
Erica Yee,Katie gave her approval for my fiddler remix haha,49,9,22:05:32
Ben Fickes,"Okay haha sounds good, Iâm sure Iâll have songs to share while weâre in Boston together",93,16,22:04:39
Erica Yee,Ok looking forward to it,24,5,21:55:00
Erica Yee,No you don't need to send more songs in that thread haha,56,12,21:54:40
Ben Fickes,"I have a longish story from tonight to share but it will be a bit before I have a chance, weâre still in campus time",118,25,21:43:32
Ben Fickes,And dang I need to do that too...,33,8,21:42:59
Ben Fickes,Ooh I canât wait to read it! Do you want me to reply with more songs? I know weâre approaching the end of our long distance time haha,137,28,21:42:51
Erica Yee,Using the coffee shop time to do that was way more fun than updating my LinkedIn profile like I planned to do haha,114,23,20:42:12
Erica Yee,no rush of course,17,4,20:39:52
Erica Yee,ok sent! (including a ITH song haha),36,7,20:39:42
Erica Yee,Have you listened to in the heights soundtrack,46,8,20:19:55
Erica Yee,of course!,10,2,19:57:40
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha. I look forward to whatever they are. And thank you for listening, that means a lot",99,19,19:46:23
Erica Yee,Don't know what direction to go with mine haha,46,9,19:45:01
Erica Yee,"Finished listening to your songs, thanks for them :)",52,9,19:44:48
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,19:44:38
Ben Fickes,27-29 is fall retreat,21,4,19:44:16

Ben Fickes,If not (or even if so) I hope we have a winter retreat this year,64,15,18:58:08
Ben Fickes,I hope you can too,18,5,18:57:49
Erica Yee,Hope I can go to fall retreat,29,7,18:57:42
Erica Yee,Almost 2 years ago wow,22,5,18:57:35
Ben Fickes,Oh you did the canoe too!,25,6,18:56:42
Erica Yee,Yeah our canoe was too fast for you,35,8,18:56:35
Erica Yee,Omg ð,8,2,18:56:29
Ben Fickes,Wow didnât know youâre here too,35,6,18:56:26
Ben Fickes,Most people have grown spiritually this week. Iâve grown physically,69,10,18:56:02
Ben Fickes,Okay haha well then take your time and enjoy it haha,52,11,18:55:21
Erica Yee,Wow you're so tall,18,4,18:55:07
Erica Yee,It is going slowly anyway,25,5,18:54:31
Erica Yee,"Not stressing me out haha, I enjoy it",37,8,18:54:27
Ben Fickes,And no pressure either way! Obviously I wanna hear your thoughts but donât want to stress you out,99,18,18:48:07
Ben Fickes,If you remix it I think Jasonâs approval rating of you will skyrocket,71,13,18:47:42
Erica Yee,Also I'm trying to do your music email right now but this coffee shop is loud and distracting ah. But I do really want to do it right now,137,29,18:45:39
Erica Yee,List*,5,1,18:44:48
Erica Yee,And it is so good. I'm putting it on just of potential songs to remix,69,15,18:44:44
Erica Yee,You haven't,11,2,18:44:22
Ben Fickes,I have heard it only because of him,35,8,18:43:46
Ben Fickes,Have I never told you how much Jason loves that song?,53,11,18:43:40
Erica Yee,Have you heard the cheeseburger song,36,6,18:43:22
Erica Yee,No idea,7,2,18:43:07
Ben Fickes,Wait but what does the comment about suicide rates on the veggie tales one mean,79,15,18:41:08
Ben Fickes,Haha thank you for sending the veggie tales one,47,9,18:33:06
Erica Yee,Lol tasty,9,2,18:19:35
Erica Yee,Ignore the veggie tales please,30,5,18:19:16
Erica Yee,There we go (way too late),26,6,18:19:05
Erica Yee,Ah I can't cancel,17,4,18:15:00
Erica Yee,Wait sorry wrong pic,20,4,18:14:46
Ben Fickes,So I drank the coffee and ate the chocolate sludge with a spoon,63,13,18:13:23
Ben Fickes,I tried to get hot chocolate but accidentally added coffee instead of hot water and then didnât mix it,104,19,18:13:08
Ben Fickes,But also we donât have to haha,32,7,18:12:47
Ben Fickes,For you I would. Sacrificial love,33,6,18:12:41
Erica Yee,And idk if I wanna put you through that,39,9,18:11:59
Erica Yee,The only one worth watching is princess and the pauper,54,10,18:09:59
Ben Fickes,Also I showed it to ty and he had no reaction,45,11,18:05:49
Ben Fickes,Our group verses included âthe truth will set you freeâ (clearly about your Barbie post),92,15,18:05:42
Ben Fickes,Ooh we can watch a Barbie movie this coming year,48,10,18:05:23
Erica Yee,He probably has already heard this truth before,47,8,16:32:08
Erica Yee,Thanks Jason,12,2,16:29:11
Erica Yee,In which their limbs move anatomically correctly,48,7,16:29:01
Erica Yee,I think it was around this point we were obsessed with Barbie movies though,75,14,16:28:34
Erica Yee,Babysitter gave some to us,26,5,16:28:13
Erica Yee,Unrealistic beauty standards blah blah blah,43,6,16:28:05
Ben Fickes,I showed Jason and he just said âokâ with no reaction,57,11,16:27:53
Ben Fickes,Oh why not? And why did you have them anyways haha,50,11,16:27:42
Erica Yee,My mom didn't want us to have barbiew,37,8,16:27:27
Erica Yee,I'm pretty sure the latter lol,30,6,16:27:17
Ben Fickes,Was it in reference to you hugging barbies or barbies hugging each other,72,13,16:26:57
Erica Yee,My goal in life is to spread truth,34,8,16:26:23
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,16:26:17
Ben Fickes,Can I show this to people?,26,6,16:24:05

Ben Fickes,HAHA ð oh my goodness thank you so much for sending this,59,12,16:23:48
Erica Yee,If you wanna see the kinds of things I posted on people's walls in high school..,80,16,16:12:23

Ben Fickes,Then we all played some volleyball and I just got back from a short run,71,15,15:59:45
Ben Fickes,"It was good, Jason and I ended up canoeing together haha. Very unbalanced and it took us a while to maneuver successfully but we did it",135,26,15:59:32
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure it will look great no matter what. Plus it grows back haha,69,14,15:58:59
Erica Yee,How was kayaking,16,3,15:48:49
Erica Yee,Sooo I asked for 4 inches so she would cut 6 but I think she actually cut 7 or 8 lol,84,21,15:48:39
Ben Fickes,Oh dang wow. Thanks for sharing haha. And nice hope it goes well! Maybe I will be surprised and you will have bright purple this time,133,26,15:20:44
Erica Yee,"Ooh have fun. I'm good, getting my hair done soon which takes like 3 hours",74,15,13:00:43
Erica Yee,Off topic but apparently Jeremy Lin just signed with the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese basketball association because no one in the NBA wanted him,145,25,13:00:20
Ben Fickes,Canât reply for a bit because going kayaking and donât wanna take my phone but howâs your day going?,106,19,13:00:01

Erica Yee,I don't want us to miss the social,34,8,12:58:23

Ben Fickes,"I know haha, just lemme know so I can know whether to ask Matt",62,14,12:58:12

Erica Yee,LOLOL I don't even know who Nicole is but I like her,52,12,12:32:29
Ben Fickes,"Now ty is proposing a crossover between the Iliad and hsm. Just like Troy falls in the illiad, Troy dies by falling over a horse and then it takes ten years for the other guys to drive home from high school",206,41,8:49:15
Ben Fickes,"Ty: âit would be great if we had a crossover between the French Revolution and High School Musicalâ

Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing all of that!,31,6,14:09:31
Erica Yee,and then thanks for sharing about prayer! that's a good reminder for me too. wheni pray for other people i often just ask for what i think is best for them...but obviously that should not be my end goal. so i need to work on that,229,46,13:39:21
Erica Yee,"ok actually don't really have thoughts on the joshua convo atm, but lookign forward to hearing more about it",108,19,13:37:36
Erica Yee,driving my mom* hahaha,22,4,13:36:32
Ben Fickes,Okay so I prayed a lot on the silent retreat and I prayed for you and other people. And I realized normally when I pray for people in general itâs very brief and I say âGod be with _â and then move on. But I was realizing the importance of taking a significant time to pray. Anyways thatâs a bigger thing but I was thinking about how I know I should pray for you more in depth beyond just examining my role in our relationship. And how important prayer is to our relationship. Just wanted to share,505,97,13:09:42
Ben Fickes,Hope driving your room is good haha,35,7,13:05:58
Ben Fickes,It just finished it was really good. Have a few thoughts mostly for call but Iâll send one now,96,19,13:05:51
Erica Yee,Driving my room repky later,27,5,11:51:34
Erica Yee,Omg I loved silent retreat,26,5,11:49:36
Ben Fickes,"Okay so it started off he was talking about reading âNot Yet Marriedâ with Dan and Vivian. And he said he said a quote which was âthe goal of dating is clarity and the goal of marriage is intimacy.â And I thought about our relationship and I asked him if he thought that meant intimacy had no place in dating. And this was all during codenames haha so we paused the convo and resumed after and talked for a couple hours. One thing that the book mentioned was âriskâ of physical and emotional intimacy, and we talked about that some. Sorry this is pretty disjointed but hard to communicate via text, Iâll tell you on the phone sometime",648,118,8:38:06
Ben Fickes,"I have a few brief things from my talk with Joshua I wanted to share, will send soon hopefully",94,19,8:20:05

Ben Fickes,If she walks tomorrow I was gonna ask her if she remembers that,63,13,22:03:14

Erica Yee,Oh yes I see on his ig story,28,8,16:11:52
Erica Yee,ð®,4,1,16:11:30
Ben Fickes,I looked at Fabricios story and it looks like he is or was in Boston?,69,15,16:09:35
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope the clouds get better haha,39,7,15:55:18
Erica Yee,Other problem is completely separate but I kinda handed it over to Evan,71,13,15:54:37
Erica Yee,More like the cloud computing problem is related to the cloud Tracker,69,12,15:54:07
Erica Yee,I can think LOL,15,4,15:52:57
Erica Yee,I lied,6,2,15:52:30
Erica Yee,Oh wait,7,2,15:52:29
Ben Fickes,Thatâs funny haha whatâs the other problem?,47,7,15:52:13
Ben Fickes,Iâll start exhaling as fast as I can,38,8,15:52:06
Erica Yee,"I realize both my problems have to do with clouds, ha",53,11,15:51:56
Erica Yee,You could make more clouds,26,5,15:51:36
Ben Fickes,Iâm sorry I wish I knew a way to help,39,10,15:49:37
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,15:49:28
Erica Yee,Evan says there's 1gb of ram available but it keeps crashing,60,11,15:48:44
Erica Yee,The Geostationary projection part of the script,47,7,15:48:26
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang thatâs very unfortunate. The script itself, or the imagery it gets?",77,13,15:46:08
Erica Yee,My script that gets the satellite imagery takes too much memory for the ec2..,77,14,15:42:09
Erica Yee,Urgh both my final projects are not going great,47,9,15:41:39
Ben Fickes,Howâs work? I know itâs busy so no rush/need to reply,57,11,14:39:58
Ben Fickes,Downloading the new epic games now though haha,46,8,14:39:46
Ben Fickes,"Apparently itâs very similar, just more grindy",48,7,14:39:37
Ben Fickes,"Thanks. And yep, thereâs a new game plus but idk if Iâll do it",66,14,14:39:00
Erica Yee,And nice that was short,23,5,14:37:19
Erica Yee,Aww hope he feels better,24,5,14:37:15
Ben Fickes,Josh is feeling sick still so weâre just chilling. I beat moonlighter haha,76,13,13:56:18
Ben Fickes,Hope work is good,17,4,12:02:02
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, just ate and I feel much more awake haha",48,10,12:01:59
Erica Yee,Ah ok. Hope you feel better,27,6,11:58:41
Ben Fickes,"Iâm feeling good but drowsy now. So either Iâll feel good once I wake up or Iâm gonna be really tired all day haha, weâll see",133,26,11:44:38
Erica Yee,You?,4,1,11:39:20
Erica Yee,A bit tired but not bad,23,6,11:39:17
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling,19,4,11:09:12
Erica Yee,Same and same to you,20,5,1:43:52
Ben Fickes,Alright Iâm gonna go to bed. Hope you can rest well tonight,61,12,1:43:42
Erica Yee,Yeah all 3 games we beat division leaders!,42,8,1:40:35
Ben Fickes,Youâve had a lot of good games haha,37,8,1:32:53
Ben Fickes,Oh nice!,8,2,1:32:50
Erica Yee,Yasss won 6-2,13,3,1:01:25
Erica Yee,Please no,9,2,0:36:50
Ben Fickes,Maybe youâll be best friends now,34,6,0:34:38
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha thatâs very unusual,41,7,0:34:18
Erica Yee,"This dude came next to us in the aisle and was like ""do you know those people?"" Pointing to the group next to us. We said no. He asked us to tap on the shoulder of the guy two seats down so I did. That guy awkwardly said hi and them the standing guy left. Afterward the guy two seats down told his friend ""I have no idea who that is"" LOL",337,72,0:29:27
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,0:23:51
Erica Yee,Indeed,6,1,0:12:07
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I also kept thinking around 9 âitâs so weird that Ericaâs at work now and not asleepâ,103,19,0:08:47
Erica Yee,I sent that earlier message cuz I was thinking oh he's asleep oh wait no he's not,81,17,0:08:09
Erica Yee,Oh yeah same,12,3,0:07:51
Ben Fickes,I keep stopping my self from doing the three hour offset to figure out what time it is for you haha,99,21,23:57:54
Ben Fickes,I also like being in the same time zone haha,44,10,23:57:33
Erica Yee,Forgot an important word lol,28,5,23:55:32
Erica Yee,Oops same*,10,2,23:55:22
Ben Fickes,Are you saying you like that weâre in the same time zone or you like this time zone in general,96,20,23:53:28
Erica Yee,Sorry if you're tired though,28,5,23:53:02
Erica Yee,I like being in the timezone,28,6,23:52:54
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,23:40:51
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well glad itâs exciting at least,45,8,23:39:15
Ben Fickes,Guess time are aâchangin,26,4,23:39:02
Erica Yee,Winning 4-1 in the 5th but it feels precarious cuz they're getting a lot of hits,80,16,23:38:58
Erica Yee,Daniella finished first yesterday and usually she or Tiffany is last,68,11,23:38:28
Ben Fickes,How goes the game,17,4,23:38:05
Erica Yee,Wow,3,1,23:38:03
Ben Fickes,I was the only one with leftovers and that feels strange,56,11,23:37:58
Ben Fickes,Indian food,11,2,23:37:29
Erica Yee,And lol because I'm bad at remembering stuff,44,8,23:36:55
Erica Yee,What kind of food,17,4,23:36:00
Ben Fickes,I mean I guess itâs something I say in general but it primarily comes up talking with you,91,18,23:33:10
Ben Fickes,Also they were talking and I heard the guy say âI remember you telling me thatâ and I thought to myself âguess Iâm not the only one who says that to my gfâ,165,33,23:32:47
Ben Fickes,"At dinner there was a couple next to us who sat down and when the waiter came to take their order the guy said âoh, we ordered on the phone.â And then the waiter went back and brought out their food. Just thought that was interesting",237,46,23:31:55
Erica Yee,Yeah haha,9,2,22:52:20
Ben Fickes,Glad he got to see your dad,27,7,22:50:29
Ben Fickes,Oh man thatâs wild! Thatâs like a Delaware thing haha,57,10,22:50:18
Erica Yee,Turns out he's the brother of one of my grandma's best friends and recognized my dad lol,88,17,22:32:53
Erica Yee,"We got up for this elderly guy to get out of the row and after he passed us, he asked my dad if he's a chin (my grandma's maiden name)",134,30,22:32:30
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:51:17
Ben Fickes,Idk two or three I think. Iâll let you know tomorrow,54,11,21:50:40
Erica Yee,How many people,15,3,21:43:41
Erica Yee,Oh I didn't know,16,4,21:43:36
Ben Fickes,Ransoms would be bad,20,4,21:20:09
Ben Fickes,*randoms,8,1,21:20:04
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you his living with ransoms?,39,8,21:19:55
Ben Fickes,I have not - his official move in day is tomorrow,49,11,21:19:47
Erica Yee,Did you see Josh's dorm yet,27,6,21:02:11
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,21:01:54
Ben Fickes,"I think thatâs a wise decision, and Iâm glad you got to go",62,13,20:50:20
Erica Yee,"When the design director invited me to go to Starbucks at first i thought ""I have so much to do so probably shouldn't"" but I realize it's better to take advantage of the time with coworkers and it was really good",212,41,20:48:09
Erica Yee,At first I thought I couldn't but I may be able to get close at least,69,16,20:47:33
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about it yourself? If you feel anything beyond the deadlines and work,89,16,20:46:17
Ben Fickes,Yeah I feel that. But that just means youâre doing a lot of good work,71,15,20:45:55
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs amazing! Thought the first message was gonna end with âAnd thereâs no way it can be implementedâ,114,19,20:45:41
Erica Yee,I am feeling like I'm running out time and there's so much more to do,69,15,20:45:18
Erica Yee,Very far from done haha,23,5,20:44:59
Erica Yee,Oh no that's the backend. Still need to make front end (based on that mockup),77,15,20:44:40
Erica Yee,"One of the designers went crazy and made this incredible mockup for it that I will never be that creative to think of, and it looks like I can actually implement it",164,32,20:44:16
Ben Fickes,Wait so the fog thing is all the way done? Congrats! I know you worked super hard on it,87,19,20:44:06
Erica Yee,"But he was very impressed with the script. ""Wow I thought I gave you a fun and pretty simple project"" lol",105,21,20:43:23
Ben Fickes,Oh dang thatâs sad. But Iâm sure thatâs not the biggest hurdle ever,73,13,20:43:09
Erica Yee,Oh also frustrating thing is I gave Evan my python script to get the fog tracker images so he can put it on our ec2. But he's having issues installing the right packages. I should've documented the dependencies better..,219,39,20:42:42
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about it being the last week?,49,10,20:41:45
Erica Yee,But now I will drown my sorrows in Sega heroes and figure it out tomorrow morning when I'm by myself haha,105,21,20:41:44
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I hope it goes well tomorrow,41,8,20:41:37
Erica Yee,"No, using jquery",16,3,20:41:12
Ben Fickes,Ah like you hit a button to make that happen?,45,10,20:40:58
Erica Yee,Swap a photo with a gif,23,6,20:40:38
Ben Fickes,Pair programming wasnât bad because the other programmers knew what they were doing and would pick up my slack if I was struggling haha,137,24,20:40:34
Ben Fickes,Ugh thatâs the worst. Glad youâre off now and can watch the game. What was the thing it was supposed to do? And thatâs nice haha,134,26,20:40:06
Erica Yee,This is a little dif but idk how you could do pair programming. I felt so stressed out doing stuff with her watching,116,23,20:38:29
Erica Yee,But it's ok. She also bought me Starbucks a few hours before this whole time disaster haha,90,17,20:36:29
Erica Yee,"Big mystery cuz it worked right until she was like ""oh let's send a preview to editors"" and then it just would not do the one thing we needed it to do",150,32,20:35:53
Erica Yee,Ugg left super late and couldn't figure out the thing i was working with the design lead on,91,18,20:35:17
Ben Fickes,I showed josh and he just said âoh noâ,42,9,19:33:54
Ben Fickes,Glad youâre feeling better! And oh my goodness thatâs hilarious,67,10,19:33:31
Erica Yee,"Not that if helps but I'm feeling fine now actually (too much caffeine probs, gonna regret tomorrow)",100,17,19:32:12
Erica Yee,Aww :(,6,2,19:31:52
Ben Fickes,And Josh is probably sick,25,5,18:51:45
Ben Fickes,I take back what I said about not being tired earlier. Weâve been lounging around all day because weâre all very tired haha,127,23,18:51:36
Erica Yee,Maybe,5,1,16:06:24
Ben Fickes,Oh wait I think you told me that before,39,9,15:57:06
Erica Yee,"A fellow, so 2 year rotational program",38,7,15:43:33
Ben Fickes,And thanks for sharing that story haha,38,7,14:44:48
Ben Fickes,Haha ð this is a full time person starting?,46,9,14:44:28
Erica Yee,Ok when you put it that way ð,32,8,14:00:19
Erica Yee,"Me: did you go to northeastern?
Guy who went to Northeastern: yes. I don't recognize you",88,16,14:00:13
Erica Yee,*New people making the welcome rounds*,38,6,13:59:43
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,13:22:19
Ben Fickes,"She did, I guess if her mattress company ever wants to make video games too she has a contact",93,19,12:41:54
Ben Fickes,Yeah thatâs her haha,22,4,12:39:59
Erica Yee,Lmao did she really,19,4,12:38:48
Erica Yee,Vanessa Lau,11,2,12:38:40
Erica Yee,Yankees...,10,1,12:38:37
Ben Fickes,Wait whatâs Vanessaâs last name? I think she might have added me on LinkedIn,80,14,12:25:19
Ben Fickes,Oh I think you showed me the pig shirts a while ago. And wow thatâs exciting haha. Hope itâs a good game. Whoâs it against?,129,25,12:17:18
Erica Yee,We're getting cool pig shirts and sitting NOT in the value deck for once,72,14,12:09:07
Erica Yee,Yeah if there are we won't stay because there aren't fireworks afterward,72,12,12:08:51
Erica Yee,And free parking Tuesday,24,4,12:08:32
Erica Yee,Yeah it's Chinese heritage night,32,5,12:08:22
Ben Fickes,Haha ð is there a special theme to this one? Hopefully there arenât extra innings haha,91,16,12:04:14
Erica Yee,Well actually it's because we bought tickets before we planned the LA trip,74,13,12:01:50
Erica Yee,Why do I do this to myself,26,7,12:01:29
Erica Yee,We're going to another baseball game lmao,41,7,12:01:25
Ben Fickes,Do you have anything after work or can you just rest?,53,11,11:57:09
Erica Yee,Ooh that's good,15,3,11:55:15
Ben Fickes,Iâm sorry. Last Tuesday though! I woke up at 4 am and was afraid that I wouldnât be able to go back asleep. But I did and I feel good,137,30,11:52:00
Erica Yee,How did you sleep,17,4,11:39:41
Erica Yee,Second day after lost sleep is always worse haha,48,9,11:39:31

Erica Yee,Just time zone,14,3,1:29:04
Ben Fickes,Hope you sleep very well hah,28,6,1:28:59
Ben Fickes,Is that a time zone reference or did a ton of stuff happen in the last few hours?,81,18,1:28:53
Erica Yee,"Ok actually need to sleep, hope you get to hotel soon",53,11,1:28:44
Erica Yee,It was great,12,3,1:28:29

Erica Yee,Got home just a bit ago.,24,6,1:27:23

Erica Yee,Do not remember at all..,24,5,19:06:12
Ben Fickes,"Overheard a guy at the airport saying how his job is to infiltrate companies that hire him to try to get their data. So guess he has the same job as that guy that spoke at Pivotal (if you remember, no worries if you donât haha)",229,46,18:55:10

Erica Yee,"Oh nice, what'd he think",24,5,15:53:11
Ben Fickes,"Completely unrelated but since you told me your jeans with a rip story, apparently my shorts were also ripped in the crotch area. My mom noticed when I was sitting on the sofa and made me throw them away haha",208,40,15:32:56
Ben Fickes,Just watched A Silent Voice with Josh,37,7,15:32:08

Erica Yee,Haha omg,8,2,12:37:46
Ben Fickes,"So we had to go to the bank to get paperwork notarized and my mom brought two of her friends as witnesses (which it turns out she didnât need but oh well). And they all said hello and all that and then one asked âso when are you heading out to LA?â And my mom replies, âThis evening. Benâs girlfriend Erica was just there this weekend...â and she started talking about you and your family. So clearly my mom really likes you enough to steer conversation about you, just wanted to share haha",502,93,12:24:26
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! And wow glad you made it to your flight on time,56,13,8:29:51
Erica Yee,LAX traffic was sooo bad. We were stuck in line to get into the airport (in a Lyft) for half an hour. Got to gate 10 mins after boarding but plane was late so it's fine,168,36,0:58:50
Erica Yee,Relatives were super fun. They went to the world cup so got to talk about that,78,16,23:38:12

Erica Yee,Ooh ok. I will probably call around 6 or 6:30,45,10,11:10:16
Ben Fickes,Iâd say you can just call me whenever and if Iâm still at game night Iâll let you know. But I usually leave by 8 or 8:30,126,27,7:34:00
Ben Fickes,Hmm idk exactly but I can talk on the way back from it too. So whenever works for you Iâll probably be en route home or home,126,27,7:33:18
Erica Yee,I am busy friday-sun so if you want to talk tomorrow I can,58,13,1:47:50
Erica Yee,When do you think you'd get back from game night tomorrow? I know you may want to stay longer since it's your last one,118,24,1:47:32

Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Hope itâs good,25,5,21:31:35
Erica Yee,Cousin (who Julia is close to) is over for dinner,49,10,21:30:49
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,21:24:41
Erica Yee,Yah,3,1,21:23:45
Ben Fickes,Itâs just four of you right?,30,6,21:21:47
Erica Yee,Yeah.. we'll see lol,20,4,21:13:03
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. And I can definitely picture that haha. I feel like they could get along really well but I know how many people annoy barbs and I think thatâs much more likely haha,174,33,21:10:01
Erica Yee,Oh well,7,2,21:08:59
Erica Yee,Barbara is too but I'm a bit worried Maya is gonna annoy her lol,64,14,21:08:57
Erica Yee,I think she's gonna be a bit high maintenance lol. First time living in an apartment and very talkative,103,19,21:07:58
Erica Yee,Direct with Barbara,19,3,21:07:24
Erica Yee,Uh actually not really politics exactly but stuff about white supremacy and sexual assault,90,14,21:07:16
Ben Fickes,Or is she in a single,21,6,21:05:59
Ben Fickes,Is she direct roommates with one of you?,40,8,21:05:54
Erica Yee,No you remembered what we initially thought which turned out to be wrong,72,13,21:04:56
Erica Yee,"Social media influencers and trends, especially teens",53,7,21:04:40
Ben Fickes,Oh my bad guess I completely misremembered,42,7,21:04:35
Erica Yee,We don't know why she got a solo pick,37,9,21:04:20
Erica Yee,She's not an RA,15,4,21:04:06
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Sheâs the RA right?,30,6,21:03:40
Ben Fickes,Oh dang thatâs a lot. What does she cover of internet culture? And what kind of politics stuff?,97,18,21:03:32
Erica Yee,Oh also spent a non insignificant amount of time messaging roommates because Maya (new one) is buying target stuff,114,19,21:03:27
Erica Yee,And some politics ones,22,4,21:03:00
Erica Yee,Listened to one with a journalist I like that moved from the daily beast to the Atlantic to NYT in like a year ð®ð® she covers internet culture,147,28,21:02:45
Erica Yee,Oh nice! That was fast,22,5,21:01:45
Ben Fickes,Owen has to check the tests tomorrow though,43,8,20:58:57
Ben Fickes,My day was good! My manager requested a new tool for viewing the status of the new tool I made. He said I donât have to finish it by the time I end and he can pick it up. But I really wanna prove I can do it haha so I actually implemented pretty much the whole thing today and another character!,297,62,20:58:49
Ben Fickes,Ooh what podcasts? And yeah I feel like no one is as an intern and most of what we do is tweaking,97,22,20:57:51
Erica Yee,How was your day,16,4,20:55:59
Erica Yee,I'm competent at tweaking pre built stuff like templates. But could not come up with the code for initial ideas on my own,121,23,20:55:52
Erica Yee,So I didn't do much thinking lol ( which means I listened to a lot of podcasts today ð),90,19,20:54:46
Ben Fickes,Not that I have any real metric but you really do seem really good at what you do,81,18,20:54:45
Ben Fickes,Oh dang nice! Way to go,23,6,20:54:30
Erica Yee,I put everything together. So built it i guess. But the vast majority was rebuilt from a previous project,105,19,20:54:04
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð okay really sorry for the panic but yeah youâre good,64,12,20:53:40
Erica Yee,Cuz that was the 1 change I had to make...,42,10,20:53:22

Ben Fickes,Six,3,1,20:53:03
Erica Yee,Wait does it say 6 or six,25,7,20:52:50
Ben Fickes,Also when I read â6 road trips to discover Californiaâ my first thought was âno one can write that headline about Delawareâ,131,22,20:52:07
Ben Fickes,What did you do for this project?,33,7,20:51:34

Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,20:39:50
Ben Fickes,Dang. Itâs actually pretty cool here rn,41,7,20:37:32
Ben Fickes,I guess it was just a pseudo-sudo issue,39,8,20:37:21
Erica Yee,It is 85 degrees in SF..,24,6,20:35:36
Erica Yee,But I fixed it and am leaving now,33,8,20:35:22

Ben Fickes,Oh dang. I hope it goes well. Sorry you have to deal with it but props to you,77,18,20:34:55
Erica Yee,"Ugh still at work because I had just published a big project that built, but right as I was leaving someone  messaged me to change something in the content. So I went back, turned on my computer and tried to redeploy. But then a there was an unrelated problem with the redeploy, and now Evan is trying to walk me through sudo-ing it away remotely",346,65,20:33:31
Erica Yee,Ooh interesting,15,2,17:52:07
Ben Fickes,Incredibly random but apparently our game is being downloaded rapidly in Saudi Arabia haha,90,14,17:26:23

Erica Yee,Do you know which game,22,5,12:45:33

Ben Fickes,I hope you are revelling in the one sonic shard reward you get haha,67,14,12:38:09

Erica Yee,Oh I finished a survival run yesterday ð,43,8,12:29:35
Erica Yee,So scary,8,2,12:29:27
Ben Fickes,I spent this morning thinking my tool broke something. But it was a fluke in the test so Iâm safe haha,104,21,12:28:33
Ben Fickes,It has been added!,18,4,12:28:09
Erica Yee,Aw ok,5,2,12:25:38

Erica Yee,What symptoms,13,2,12:25:07
Erica Yee,Oh noo,6,2,12:25:05
Ben Fickes,Am slightly worried that I might be getting sick. But they paid me in advance for this week so I gotta work haha. Also not that bad rn,134,28,12:15:16
Ben Fickes,I learned about it as a poetic thing in Latin so may not be real haha,69,16,12:14:50
Erica Yee,Oh I never heard of that phrase but it sounds right,51,11,12:08:44
Ben Fickes,Thatâs absolutely hilarious haha. It might be transferred epithet (the hundred years thing right?),100,14,12:07:38
Ben Fickes,Wow Iâm even more impressed at you now that I know you can text in your sleep,79,17,12:07:04
Erica Yee,I've been laughing at the second sentence for like 5 minutes. I don't remember the grammatical term but that needs to be edited so badly,136,25,11:19:54
Erica Yee,"Lol no but I'm ok so far, woke up late though",45,11,11:19:09
Erica Yee,I'm actually typing this while asleep,37,6,11:18:39
Ben Fickes,"When you wake up, how are you feeling?",38,8,7:49:52
Ben Fickes,I think so. He said he just needed to talk about it,51,12,7:31:18
Erica Yee,Do you think he felt better afterwards?,39,7,23:23:41
Erica Yee,Aww glad you could be there for him,35,8,23:23:34
Ben Fickes,"Mike just left. We walked and talked a bit. He said he was feeling like harming himself and didnât want to be alone. He talked about how he worried about what people think about him. And I talked to him about how, even though I donât harm myself and itâs not the same thing, I do worry about what other people think of me. And I didnât know how but I felt like I should talk about faith. So I mentioned the idea of being made in Godâs image. And he replied with âsomething something itâs like how God made you in His image but also gave you flaws.â Donât think itâs exactly like that but did not get into a theological debate. Anyways will tell you more via phone but wanted to give you a recap",714,137,23:13:49
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,22:10:17
Erica Yee,Mid September,13,2,22:09:37

Ben Fickes,"Just finished dnd with family. Very good session, adding it to my list haha",75,14,21:50:34
Ben Fickes,HAHA Iâm just both amazed that you were able to find it and that you had the patience to go all the way back,110,24,21:50:19
Erica Yee,And all because that important command is not documented in the repo,68,12,20:03:41
Erica Yee,"I could not remember the command to deploy a project with the old template, and the other developers couldn't either. So I held the up arrow key for like 7 mins in my terminal until I got to when I last used it that command (in June I think) LOLOLOL",249,50,20:02:45
Erica Yee,It's so funny,13,3,20:01:06
Erica Yee,I just did the dumbest thing ever,33,7,20:00:58
Erica Yee,Lol I have no doubt I did before,32,8,17:07:00
Ben Fickes,"And Iâve seen you type veerrrryyy slowly before, idk when but it is familiar haha",83,15,16:57:27
Ben Fickes,Aw dang. I hope you feel better,31,7,16:57:07

Ben Fickes,Aw man. Well good luck haha,27,6,12:55:43
Erica Yee,Lol the only problem is this is on the old template (not react) and I can't remember all the commands,101,20,12:25:21
Erica Yee,Ah got it,9,3,12:24:50
Ben Fickes,You should ask to go on a paid road trip to fully understand the article,72,15,12:17:37
Ben Fickes,But if it doesnât work I donât wanna know because then Iâll have to fix it,80,16,12:17:03

Erica Yee,And nice!,9,2,12:10:50
Erica Yee,It's a road trip guide,22,5,12:10:42
Erica Yee,Wait I don't get it,19,5,12:10:22
Ben Fickes,"Iâm good, feel happy this is done. Have some documentation and a couple characters to do this week but shouldnât be anything too bad",136,24,12:10:12
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs really nice, whatâs the new task?",47,8,12:09:33
Ben Fickes,If you want to just buy something with money and ask customer service for a refund (please donât I donât wanna work on this any more),137,26,12:09:22
Erica Yee,Got another task to do which I'm glad for cuz I need a break to do something else,81,18,12:08:21

Ben Fickes,I just pushed the code for my tool. Unless it breaks everything (really hoping it doesnât haha) I finished it!,112,20,10:57:16
Ben Fickes,Very random but I thought to myself âhow long until Erica is back in Boston?â and itâs three weeks today haha,115,21,6:33:27
Ben Fickes,Thanks!,7,1,6:32:42
Erica Yee,Thanks hope you rest well too and can be done with the tool,59,13,23:30:44

Ben Fickes,Alright Iâm gonna go to bed. Hope you wake up feeling good and have a good day at work,88,19,23:13:58

Erica Yee,That whole thing is so sus,26,6,23:06:08
Erica Yee,No worries,10,2,23:06:03

Erica Yee,Lack of wifi drives people to do crazy things,45,9,22:07:05
Ben Fickes,We will see if this happens or deescalates,42,8,21:57:54
Ben Fickes,Shem and Thiago agreed to drink their own urine if the other does,65,13,21:57:42

Erica Yee,Oooh,4,1,21:12:30
Ben Fickes,I realized today that (if my life does not take an unexpected turn) the next time I go into work on a Monday I will not be an intern,132,29,20:45:34
Erica Yee,Haha it gets better in several days but thanks,46,9,20:44:24
Ben Fickes,Well glad itâs not too terrible at least this time. Hope it gets better soon. (Idk how periods feel so no idea if that realistic or not),138,27,20:25:59
Erica Yee,Started period which is ugh but not too terrible this time,58,11,20:24:05
Ben Fickes,Very true. How are you feeling now?,35,7,20:22:23

Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I really hope it goes well. And if not I hope something good comes out of it,89,19,18:52:13
Erica Yee,"More like they were just kinda like ""try and figure something out"" but no one had looked at the data before",107,21,18:36:39
Ben Fickes,Did the people who assigned you the project know the scope of it?,65,13,18:29:18

Erica Yee,Various react and python data analysis stuff,44,7,18:12:56
Ben Fickes,I *think* my tool is done. Talked to joe and had to undo most of the changes Owen recommended to me that I worked on today. So thatâs a little annoying. Owen left for today but tomorrow if he okays it itâs done,214,43,17:22:50
Ben Fickes,"I gotcha. What kinda stuff? And that makes sense, I gotcha. Nice that you got to spend time with them though",108,21,17:21:32
Erica Yee,"Plus I miss everyone in Boston and the independence lol. Not that my parents are super strict, but it's a lot different",119,22,15:21:02
Erica Yee,"This internship has been great but it's given me lots of ideas of things I want to learn, and I want more time to try that stuff out (which I don't have while working full time), if that makes sense",198,40,15:20:33
Erica Yee,I am also ready to be back on campus,36,9,15:19:20
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling about your last two weeks haha,50,10,14:32:01

Erica Yee,How do you feel about your last week,36,8,12:35:08
Erica Yee,"Woke up early because of the dream and didn't really go back to sleep, but I'm feeling ok",89,18,12:35:00

Ben Fickes,But if I can figure this out then Iâm basically done,54,11,12:04:35
Ben Fickes,Itâs this thing called session guild that is locking the game up. Owen doesnât know which one to use so I have to figure it out,131,26,12:03:55
Erica Yee,Ooh yay!,8,2,12:02:36
Ben Fickes,"Very excited to hear about this dream haha. Iâm very close. Got a lot done, one small thing left",98,19,11:55:56

Erica Yee,I rarely reread books though,28,5,21:10:50
Erica Yee,Hmm sometimes. I think I focus on different things. Like this time I was watching Jane's (older sister) expressions a lot and had greater appreciation for the actress,166,28,21:10:34

Ben Fickes,Do you notice new things when you watch it?,43,9,21:09:02

Erica Yee,Nope lol,8,2,21:02:21
Erica Yee,"Never really hung out. I think V used to not like him, but hopefully it's better now (I'll ask her later)",105,21,21:02:15
Ben Fickes,Oh glad it was good! Are they not friends as in they donât like each other or just donât know each other? And did you get to talk to him at all?,148,32,21:01:18
Erica Yee,Which I feel bad about cuz I kept pushing it but also don't really want to do lol,81,18,21:01:06
Erica Yee,Then cuz we were having fun I basically blew off skyping Ariel,62,12,21:00:25
Erica Yee,Watching P&P was a pleasure as usual,36,7,20:59:45
Erica Yee,"It's good. Hung out just with Calvin and Vanessa cuz Tiffany couldn't make it, and they aren't friends but think it was actually really good",140,25,20:59:28
Erica Yee,Yeah doesn't look like it haha,30,6,20:58:48
Ben Fickes,How was/is your day?,20,4,20:58:25
Ben Fickes,Very sadly I donât remember the name of it. But donât think so,66,13,20:58:10
Erica Yee,Is that the strand by any chance? (Only bookstore I know in New York haha),74,15,20:57:08

Ben Fickes,"Thanks! Am here for about two more hours, then go back to Boston",64,13,15:00:27
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah I remember that's a reason why we didn't go regularly on Sundays, but glad it was good!",95,19,14:40:47
Erica Yee,I took notes so I'll tell you later,35,8,14:40:19
Ben Fickes,"I was worried mine would be very prosperity gospel-ish, and I was especially worried because we have non Christian family here. But it was pretty good",150,26,14:39:09
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! I added it to my list but do you have any more thoughts?,65,15,14:38:15

Ben Fickes,"Yep! Just left. It was a really good sermon actually, about Ten Commandments. Talked to Albert, siu kay, and maambo afterward (separately). Told Albert we were dating and his reaction was funny, Iâll tell you about it later",225,38,12:21:14
Erica Yee,Did you go to enc?,18,5,11:53:23

Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Well I feel like the dad is a the one they most often kill off in stories,82,19,5:42:44

Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,21:03:26
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,20:58:51
Erica Yee,There's a way to get higher res but there's no tutorials,56,11,20:58:42
Erica Yee,Can zoom in on bay area but it's too blurry to be useful,56,13,20:58:30
Ben Fickes,"Whatâs going on with it? Unless itâs too hard to explain. And yep tomorrowâs the last day. Have fun, hope you can relax some",130,24,20:57:03
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm going to Vanessa's,27,5,20:49:42
Erica Yee,Is tomorrow the last day?,25,5,20:49:27
Erica Yee,And wow that sounds challenging,31,5,20:49:17
Erica Yee,It was ok. Getting more and more frustrated with this satellite imagery and don't know if what I want is possible. But we'll ser,128,24,20:49:02
Ben Fickes,How was work? And youâre hanging out with friends right?,58,10,20:40:35
Ben Fickes,VBS was crazy. The kids were so crazy. Two were willfully disobedient of whatever we said. But tomorrowâs an easy day because basically their parents take care of them,169,29,20:40:22
Erica Yee,And nice!,9,2,20:24:12
Erica Yee,"Ah ok, you didn't tell me but that's good it's progressing",58,11,20:24:07
Ben Fickes,Oh another work thing - we got featured on the Apple store! So I hope that helps sales etc,90,19,17:59:03
Ben Fickes,And I think youâll do great on your project haha,50,10,17:54:15
Ben Fickes,Made progress though,20,3,17:54:01
Ben Fickes,It was good! Donât know if I told you but I am not at all done with my tool. Joe and Owen both had a lot of (really good) feedback but now I have more stuff to work on,169,39,17:53:54
Erica Yee,How was work for you,20,5,17:44:35
Erica Yee,Oh well we'll see what happens,30,6,17:44:31
Erica Yee,Ok even with his help I still can't get exactly what I want lol,63,14,17:44:22
Ben Fickes,I feel like youâll definitely be the expert on this at your workplace haha,76,14,17:40:32
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness thatâs awesome! Way to go,42,8,17:40:05
Erica Yee,"I reached out yesterday to a meteorology grad student whose tutorials I was using to explore satellite imagery, and today he sent me a custom jupyter notebook on how to see fog data ð®ð® so grateful",202,36,15:07:16
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,12:32:09
Ben Fickes,Also just saw your music email!,31,6,12:22:04
Ben Fickes,"I will tell you about it on the phone haha (not in writing), itâs a little complicated but I will tell you my personal thoughts and plan for this set",151,30,12:21:49
Erica Yee,Lemme know when I should go for the bundle please haha,54,11,12:07:00
Erica Yee,Got it,6,2,12:06:50
Ben Fickes,"And I remember you telling me about that one, canât wait to see it",68,14,12:04:58
Ben Fickes,You canât know as a player until theyâre announced (some time every other Tuesday). I just know because I programmed them all haha,134,23,12:04:42
Erica Yee,Didn't help with this project at all but so cool https://projects.sfchronicle.com/guides/sf-movie-disasters/,108,11,11:01:02
Erica Yee,And yeah I have been completing them recently haha,50,9,10:57:52
Erica Yee,How do you know what's in the set,33,8,10:57:37
Erica Yee,Oh I def don't want werewolf,28,6,10:57:29
Ben Fickes,"Oh and speaking of, if you complete the all the daily quests you get gems. Not that itâs necessarily worth the time but wanted to let you know haha",149,29,6:34:23
Ben Fickes,"That being said, if you just want shards from shenmue, you should buy now. But eventually youâll be able to loot those (you can loot Ryo now already)",151,28,6:33:42
Ben Fickes,Personally I would wait til later in this set since there are four characters per set. Itâll be higher chance of new unlock and IMO all the others are better than werewolf,173,32,6:32:50
Erica Yee,Ooh I have diamonds to get the 10 for 2700. Should I do it?,59,14,23:06:22
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,22:50:46
Ben Fickes,"Alright gonna go to bed now, goodnight",38,7,22:49:53
Erica Yee,And lmao omg,12,3,22:49:28
Erica Yee,Ooh I like that verse,21,5,22:49:22
Ben Fickes,"I asked my roommates if your letter arrived and John and Shem both said âyeah, we read it, it was really sweet, itâs on the table.â Trolling of course haha",161,30,22:48:52
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,22:48:14
Ben Fickes,"Read this verse that really stuck out to me. âWho among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let the one who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on their God.â
â­â­Isaiahâ¬ â­50:10â¬
Idk stuck out to me because I feel like we always talk about walking in the light. But this is about being in a dark place which I think is important too",402,80,22:48:11
Erica Yee,"Lol no it's ok, your support means a lot",40,9,22:46:44
Ben Fickes,Sorry I donât have more to offer for help,43,9,22:45:51
Ben Fickes,Hmmm. That is kinda scary. This feels cheap to say but I do believe in you,74,16,22:45:42
Erica Yee,They basically gave me free rein of this project which is scary cuz idk if I can finish it in 2.5 weeks,103,22,22:44:38
Erica Yee,Sorta but it's hard because I don't have specific questions. And others haven't worked with this satellite imagery before,121,19,22:44:10
Ben Fickes,Is there anyone who can help? And no I donât sadly,52,11,22:43:25
Erica Yee,Do you use rclone?,18,4,22:42:36
Erica Yee,It will probably get worse cuz I have no idea what I'm doing or what the end product should be lol,98,21,22:42:29
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs awesome! I hope the coming days arenât so overwhelming. And thatâs great, I used them for the first time (at demiurge) yesterday haha",149,25,22:39:55
Erica Yee,Learning how to use AWS S3 buckets lol,38,8,22:17:51
Erica Yee,But today I made good progress on accessing and analyzing the needed data so yay,80,15,22:16:01
Erica Yee,It was pretty good. These past few days have felt super overwhelming because I feel like I'm just flailing around with the fog tracker,134,24,22:15:36
Ben Fickes,How was your day?,17,4,22:06:33
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Hope it works out,28,6,22:06:27
Erica Yee,Maybe next week,15,3,22:03:13
Erica Yee,We ended up not cuz they didn't give us all the info in time,60,14,22:03:10
Ben Fickes,Do you have a dinner tonight?,29,6,21:14:36
Ben Fickes,Do not know him,15,4,21:14:29
Erica Yee,Alejandro Serrano,17,2,21:13:44
Ben Fickes,Oh whatâs his name? I probably donât know him but just in case,66,13,21:10:20
Erica Yee,Never met him but recognize his name,36,7,21:08:12
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I saw the names of the new fellows starting in a few weeks and I'm pretty sure one is from northeastern,111,23,21:08:07
Erica Yee,Lol ð,8,2,21:07:38
Ben Fickes,Unless Iâm being signed up for something different than I think,65,11,21:05:55
Ben Fickes,I think so but only once a month,32,8,21:05:41
Erica Yee,Oh nice! Do you have to go at different times then,50,11,21:00:52
Ben Fickes,But he also talks very violently ð¬,37,7,21:00:09
Ben Fickes,It was really cute,18,4,20:59:43
Ben Fickes,And I got recruited for kids church. Which I tried to apply for a year or two ago but my email never got returned haha (guess I gotta prove myself),147,30,20:59:38
Erica Yee,#colonization,13,1,20:59:29
Erica Yee,Kid European accents are so cute,32,6,20:59:15
Erica Yee,Aww good job,12,3,20:58:48
Ben Fickes,We had a new kid with a very strong Irish accent. Another kid teased him for how he said the word cousin. Gave the kid a talking to and he was sorry and actually then tried really hard to be nice to the kid and now it seems like the new kid and him are friends which is nice,274,59,20:56:17
Erica Yee,And omg lol they did remember,29,6,20:47:07
Erica Yee,He keeps changing the subject so idk,36,7,20:47:00
Ben Fickes,Except the four year old says your name âErica Eâ,53,10,20:28:59
Ben Fickes,First words two different kids said to me were âErica Yeeâ,62,11,20:28:47
Ben Fickes,Is victor okay?,15,3,20:28:21
Ben Fickes,Oh my mind just skipped over that haha. No idea haha I know they do censor stuff. And no worries haha,101,21,20:28:17
Erica Yee,Whoops sorry for the Victor surprise lol,40,7,20:16:24

Erica Yee,Do you think Roger typed ... Or the censored it lol,51,11,20:15:36
Erica Yee,Lol lemme know,14,3,17:54:37
Ben Fickes,But weâll see,15,3,16:57:50
Ben Fickes,My guess is the four year old will find it funny but not remember your name and have to ask an older kid which will spur them on,128,28,16:57:47
Ben Fickes,Iâm wondering if the kids at VBS will remember you today and find it funny enough to bring up,95,19,16:57:24
Ben Fickes,Oh dang that looks good,23,5,16:34:02
Erica Yee,Fat rice noodles,16,3,16:25:34
Erica Yee,Loool np,8,2,12:28:21
Ben Fickes,Thank you I appreciate it! Just know I will 100% fail if you test me on it haha,79,18,12:25:16
Erica Yee,I used to not say names if it's not relevant but then you ask for names so I thought I'd add it haha,100,23,12:16:27
Erica Yee,Lolol,5,1,12:16:02
Ben Fickes,OH I thought it wa something theological. Like the player was Christian and was the hope of all Christians in soccer,116,21,12:15:31
Erica Yee,These*,6,1,12:09:17
Erica Yee,And I really need to write this down,36,8,12:09:15
Erica Yee,That's his name,15,3,12:09:08
Ben Fickes,Christian pulisic? And ooh time to combine that with your other soccer story ideas haha,87,15,12:05:59
Erica Yee,And apparently his parents met in college where they both played soccer! Story idea ð,88,15,12:03:26

Ben Fickes,And I think that is funny haha thank you for sharing,52,11,11:57:25
Ben Fickes,"Yeah, didnât feel like I was gonna puke. And Iâm feeling good now. And no rush, wanted to get it in before you replied is all",129,26,11:57:05
Erica Yee,Ok this isn't as funny when I type it out lol sorry. But she took one of my dad's notepads so maybe this will be life-changing,126,26,11:22:34
Erica Yee,"Dad: did you finish charting? (Inputting records about patients)
Mom: no I still have Monday's patients to do. But I need a new system to keep notes. Sometimes my post-its go flying (*shows haphazard spread of post-its on folder*)
Dad: ...aren't these matters of life and death",277,47,11:21:55

Erica Yee,Aw no,5,2,11:07:40
Ben Fickes,So I woke up early enough to run but spent the entire time in the bathroom sitting on the toilet (sorry for the tmi). Guess I went too fast into âmy stomach is fully recovered.â But I added a brief amendment to my music email about Time,240,47,7:56:03
Ben Fickes,But I hope you get enough sleep and donât feel tired today,60,12,6:31:34

Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad,12,3,22:59:13
Ben Fickes,Wasnât able to phrase my thoughts too deeply or in as great of length as I talked to you and Shem about. But I talked about it a little bit. And then she talked about things like how she and Shem started dating (crazy wild story) and asked about how we started dating and stuff like that and I just ended up talking about things like me seeing your family and stuff for a while,379,75,22:50:52

Erica Yee,Walking now but will read soon hopefully,40,7,20:31:07
Erica Yee,Oh i thought you were gonna make me wait till we call haha,58,13,20:31:01
Ben Fickes,I was dying of laughter but also trying to calm them down,57,12,20:29:06
Ben Fickes,And then he kept turning to me and shouting âyour phone is ringing! Itâs your girlfriend calling because she wants to marry you!â,135,23,20:28:44
Ben Fickes,"So I was about to text you some funny story and I saw that one of the kids was watching me so i put my phone away. Another kid said âwhat are you doing?â And I said âtexting someone.â They said âwho?â And I thought I shouldnât lie and they would be mature so I said âmy girlfriend.â (BIG MISTAKE). The kid asked âwhatâs her name?â And started laughing. I didnât reply but the kid who saw me pull out my phone said âErica Yee!â Because I guess he read your name on my screen. So then three kids started chanting your name and one went up to every other kid nearby (thankfully there werenât many at that point, this was before official start) and said âdo you know who Erica Yee is? His girlfriend!â Then the one kid (the first one, heâs four) couldnât remember your last name ever, so he kept making them up, including âGXâ (which is a huge compliment in PokÃ©mon cards, you should be honored) and âmarriageâ",955,172,20:28:05
Erica Yee,Omg what have you done,22,5,20:16:45
Ben Fickes,*loudly,7,1,19:59:10
Ben Fickes,I will give you this tease: one kid started shouting âErica Yeeâ very light,79,14,19:58:38
Ben Fickes,They know about you so many stories haha will tell later,56,11,19:01:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah same one,13,3,18:56:42
Erica Yee,Didn't you also have one for soccer nights,42,8,18:07:22
Erica Yee,Oh you didn't tell me that,26,6,18:07:06
Ben Fickes,"Found out that I donât actually have two of the pastors kids, just one and theyâre really good friends",106,19,17:54:29
Erica Yee,Yum,3,1,17:50:22

Ben Fickes,Would actually go back but will never get the French toast again in case it was that,84,17,17:36:06
Ben Fickes,I liked it so much I wanted to taste it twice I guess,53,13,17:35:40
Erica Yee,"Lol Victor was like ""brunch was really good I want to go back""",62,13,12:32:24
Erica Yee,No idea what happened,21,4,12:31:31
Erica Yee,Postponed,9,1,12:31:27
Ben Fickes,Oh and my coworkers diagnosed me with food poisoning haha,57,10,12:18:15
Ben Fickes,Whaaat dang. Are they postponed or straight up cancelled? And are they okay?,76,13,12:17:06
Erica Yee,Farewell drinks cancelled tonight cuz coworker who it's for us concussed (?!),77,12,12:08:08
Erica Yee,Tired but ok,12,3,12:07:41
Ben Fickes,Oh dang how are you feeling,27,6,12:05:39
Erica Yee,Think it's cuz I slept really long Sunday night,47,9,11:23:55

Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,11:21:31
Erica Yee,Yess that was so sketch,23,5,11:10:27
Ben Fickes,"Very random (and off topic of bible verse), but do you remember when we sat by that pyramid scheme group in nyc? Walked by two people talking about pyramid schemes and it made me think of it haha",195,38,8:20:55
Ben Fickes,Oh I like that a lot. Thank you for sharing that ð,53,12,7:25:10
Erica Yee,"I think it's cuz I have to feel like I'm ""on"" a lot of the time. Staying aware of what's going on, whether it's with my friends or with the news. But with God I can ""return to my rest"" and know he's with me even while I'm on this Earth",235,51,23:21:42
Erica Yee,"""the unwary"" in NLT is ""those of childlike faith""",49,9,23:19:41
Erica Yee,"The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.
The Lord protects the unwary; when I was brought low, he saved me.
Return to your rest, my soul, for the Lord has been good to you. 
For you, Lord, have delivered me from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before the Lord in the land of the living",346,68,23:19:09
Erica Yee,I like these verses:,20,4,23:17:18
Erica Yee,Friday^,7,1,22:50:56
Erica Yee,That should work then I think,29,6,22:50:47
Erica Yee,Oh it is Saturday?,18,4,22:50:37
Ben Fickes,But as always no pressure and I will be happy to talk with you whenever it is :),80,18,22:49:32
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well Iâm meeting with RenÃ©e tomorrow but should be free rest of the week. And I donât leave for nyc until Saturday am so can also talk Friday (slight chance I have something Iâm forgetting but I donât think so),230,42,22:49:11
Erica Yee,But I can probably talk before it if so. And need to find out time of thing on Wednesday (if we're even going),110,23,22:48:33
Erica Yee,"And then my hs friends want to do dinner so I asked for Friday, but I think it might have to be Thursday (if it happens)",120,26,22:48:12
Erica Yee,"People from the church we visited invited us to a dinner/sg thing on Wednesday, but Julia hasn't texted them back yet to get details",132,24,22:47:40
Erica Yee,Still trying to figure out the rest of the week,47,10,22:47:13
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,22:46:58
Ben Fickes,Also Iâm supposed to be back in Boston around 9:30 on Sunday (arriving at back bay).  Just to let you know,108,21,22:46:33

Erica Yee,It's just lunch on Wednesday,28,5,22:45:46
Ben Fickes,Whenâs the dinner?,20,3,22:45:36
Ben Fickes,Wow your mom is such a networker,32,7,22:45:32
Erica Yee,"I told my mom about the intern dinner and she was like ""who cares about the interns? Get to know the regular staff"" ð",120,24,22:41:19
Erica Yee,Omggg that's impressive,23,3,22:40:19
Ben Fickes,Thatâs it haha,16,3,21:50:19
Ben Fickes,"Okay so one VBS story: we go downstairs to hear a skit of the plagues. And the kids are crazy, theyâre running everywhere. So I started yelling for the kids in my group (and they actually listen if you say their names) so I got all three of them and we sat down. Then I look to my left and one of the other kids in another group has climbed a pole (in the thirty seconds weâve been there) and is all the way to the ceiling and is refusing to come down",455,93,21:50:13
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,21:35:57
Erica Yee,Nice!,5,1,21:31:40
Ben Fickes,But I have to have Owen go over it,34,9,21:28:58
Ben Fickes,I think Iâm done with my tool,31,7,21:28:49
Ben Fickes,Yeah I feel like thatâs the best feeling to have because itâs such a long term impact,89,17,21:28:35
Erica Yee,"It's kinda cool cuz every time I see them use it in the future, I know made the template that powers it",103,22,21:27:45
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,21:27:12
Ben Fickes,Way to go,9,3,21:25:11
Ben Fickes,Especially the configurables part,33,4,21:25:08
Ben Fickes,Dang that sounds incredibly useful,34,5,21:24:59
Erica Yee,"And as a bonus I added ""configurables"" for the designers so they can change colors etc without getting into the code",116,21,21:23:41
Erica Yee,New template that adds am additional presentation option,56,8,21:23:01
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Which project,22,4,21:21:02
Erica Yee,I'm good. Finished a project I've been working on the last several days,71,13,21:19:07
Erica Yee,To everything,13,2,21:18:41
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,21:18:38
Ben Fickes,âFood for the stomach and the stomach for foodâ - a very out of context distortion of a piece of a bible verse I will quote to justify eating pizza and ice cream to accompany your allusion,192,37,21:06:14
Ben Fickes,How was your day?,17,4,21:02:34
Ben Fickes,But I felt fine after the pizza,31,7,21:02:29
Ben Fickes,It would appear so. Also ate an ice cream sandwich afterward haha so really going all or nothing here,101,19,21:02:22
Erica Yee,So you can eat regular food?,28,6,20:54:45
Erica Yee,"I mean, this is what they're for",32,7,20:54:02
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I love the application of your biblical allusions,59,10,20:48:14
Erica Yee,But am debating whether I should be the brother in the parable who says he'll help his father in the vineyard but doesn't,121,23,20:28:06
Erica Yee,Also against all my instincts I invited all the interns to get lunch together cuz I never see any of them,105,21,20:27:05
Erica Yee,But then realized 3rd and 4th get the same thing,48,10,20:26:29
Erica Yee,I was like gotta beat Roger for third place in boss leaderboard,63,12,20:26:22
Erica Yee,Haha yay,8,2,20:25:46
Ben Fickes,I have several stories I will note and possibly text you about later,68,13,20:24:21
Ben Fickes,VBS was good but very crazy haha,32,7,20:24:03
Erica Yee,And if the pizza goes too I guess,33,8,18:23:00
Erica Yee,You'll be great,15,3,18:22:52
Erica Yee,Ooh lemme know how it goes,26,6,18:22:48
Ben Fickes,Also dinner is pizza so guess weâre gonna see if I really am better,69,14,18:00:20
Ben Fickes,Iâm at vbs and the first thing Taylor said to me was âyour group is all 7 year old boysâ,94,20,17:44:11
Erica Yee,True true ð¤,14,3,15:39:17
Ben Fickes,HAHA but option b is also a contender,37,8,15:33:17
Erica Yee,To no one's surprise,20,4,14:25:33
Erica Yee,So i guess option a is correct,30,7,14:24:22
Erica Yee,Ok she said she remembers me,28,6,14:24:10
Ben Fickes,Maybe youâre so good at your job theyâre trying to get as many Ericas as possible,85,16,14:19:03
Erica Yee,"So either a) my memory is faulty, b) she got plastic surgery in the last month, or 3) they interviewed two candidates named Erica in the last month",147,28,13:40:17
Erica Yee,But just saw her and she looks different than I remember,56,11,13:39:33

Ben Fickes,Haha good point,15,3,12:29:40
Erica Yee,True but you finish before everyone else haha,45,8,12:24:25

Erica Yee,Was just stuffing my face while everybody watched on (cuz church went really long),82,14,12:15:46
Erica Yee,I honestly don't even know what I ate,37,8,12:15:31

Erica Yee,How pregnancy or the game or what works lol,43,9,0:13:57
Ben Fickes,Michael didnât remember she was pregnant (apparently part of Vivianâs characters backstory) so now weâre asking tons of questions and Michael doesnât know how it works,175,26,0:08:40
Erica Yee,Does it give birth to a mouse,29,7,0:05:48
Ben Fickes,Who is pregnant,15,3,0:01:09

Erica Yee,Soccer was so exhausting even though I only played for half an hour max lol,75,15,11:44:16
Erica Yee,Still on Bart but I feel the same,33,8,11:43:38
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling today? Is it different being your birthday or just another day at work?,91,17,11:41:21
Ben Fickes,"Okay Iâll add it to the list, Iâm excited to hear about it haha",67,14,11:40:48

Erica Yee,It was autocorrect,18,3,20:58:40
Ben Fickes,Hope soccer is good,19,4,20:58:14
Ben Fickes,Thatâs like the opposite of a half sentence,45,8,20:58:05
Ben Fickes,Wow you used an s,17,5,20:57:56
Erica Yee,Thanks :P,9,2,20:57:42
Ben Fickes,If I donât Iâll let you know,32,7,20:55:49
Ben Fickes,Yes ofc haha,12,3,20:55:43
Erica Yee,If I talk in half sentenced will you understand me,50,10,20:55:31
Ben Fickes,I figured thatâs what you meant haha,38,7,20:53:39
Erica Yee,Of candidates,13,2,20:52:53
Erica Yee,Honestly barely following this round though. Waiting for more weeding out,73,11,20:52:50
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on it,49,9,20:52:10
Erica Yee,Calvin and I are listening to it in the car lol,47,11,20:51:38
Erica Yee,"That is never gonna fly with moderates, let alone swing /gop voters",67,12,20:51:22
Ben Fickes,Are you watching the debate too?,32,6,20:51:06
Erica Yee,Progressives talking about taking away privatized health care from people who are paying for it is gonna implode the party,122,20,20:50:39
Ben Fickes,I mean play again,17,4,20:48:22
Ben Fickes,Debate is on and Iâll probably try moonlighter later,54,9,20:47:30
Ben Fickes,And nope Iâm back at my place,31,7,20:47:21
Ben Fickes,Coincidences happen,19,2,20:47:15
Erica Yee,Are you still with your friends?,32,6,20:47:11
Erica Yee,And you're welcome,18,3,20:46:59
Erica Yee,Cuz she is,10,3,20:46:55
Ben Fickes,And why not?,12,3,20:41:42
Ben Fickes,Ah I gotcha. Thank you very much for explaining that more I really appreciate it :),83,16,20:41:36
Erica Yee,Also found out I can't make my character blond now haha,55,11,20:40:53
Erica Yee,But more like I felt privileged to overhear an intimate conversation that added more depth,90,15,20:40:16
Erica Yee,"Actually not really ""that she""",30,5,20:39:34
Erica Yee,Yeah basically,14,2,20:38:13
Ben Fickes,And wow beat him up to warm up for soccer. Jk of course haha,60,14,20:37:24
Ben Fickes,Yeah I gotcha. Not to put words in your mouth (so correct me) but youâre saying that sheâs someone you admire (writing wise) so much but now youâre hearing that âeven sheâ has worries and insecurities about what she does?,231,40,20:37:08
Erica Yee,This dude that's at least 6 inches taller than me just stole the strap I was holding onto ðð,98,19,20:36:12
Erica Yee,Idk if that makes sense,23,5,20:35:11
Erica Yee,But seriously getting insight about her insecurities and hearing her editor encouraging her when I think her writing is incredible was super interesting,152,23,20:35:07
Erica Yee,NYT just came out with a big story covering the exact same thing her beat is and they were talking about how she can feel insecure about her work when these big national outlets come in and cover the same thing. She's only 26 and I was thinking like wowww adding more depth to my character lol,293,57,20:34:10
Erica Yee,Today I awkwardly sorta eavesdropped on a conversation between her and her editor cuz they happened to be stoppwd right next to my desk..,137,24,20:31:34
Erica Yee,I listened to the podcast before I even applied to the chronicle. Anyway thought her writing was sooo good,106,19,20:30:48
Ben Fickes,You mightâve told me about that part but I canât quite remember,67,12,20:30:22
Erica Yee,Not that I know of haha,23,6,20:29:54
Erica Yee,"So forgot if I told you this part, but the journalist character is inspired by this podcast interview with a Chronicle reporter who covers fires",144,25,20:29:43
Ben Fickes,Is one of your journalist coworkers dating a firefighter haha,61,10,20:29:12

Ben Fickes,Oh dang persuasion works so much better,39,7,17:30:37
Ben Fickes,âPride and prejudiceâ added to list is what you really meant I think,72,13,17:30:28
Erica Yee,Jk ofc you guessed right haha,29,6,17:16:24
Erica Yee,'Perhaps',9,1,17:16:14
Ben Fickes,Unless you meant âperiodicallyâ or âpartiallyâ,54,6,16:56:04
Ben Fickes,"Will add it to my list, the please cracks me up",47,11,16:55:47
Erica Yee,"Funniest bug I've ever seen with the videos in the project, PATL",64,12,14:18:32
Erica Yee,Lolololol thanks,16,2,12:33:05

Erica Yee,Where to even start,19,4,12:11:07
Ben Fickes,Still reading but this is really good so far. What did you work on for it?,74,16,12:09:13
Erica Yee,(very long),11,2,12:05:35
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,12:05:30
Erica Yee,I feel like this is my life's work,34,8,12:05:29
Ben Fickes,I would love to witness part of the Erica origin story,54,11,12:05:26
Erica Yee,https://projects.sfchronicle.com/sf-homeless/24-hours-homelessness/,67,1,12:05:24
Erica Yee,But it's kinda in the weeds lol,31,7,12:04:51
Erica Yee,Oh I can send it to you if you want,35,10,12:04:46
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Do you happen to remember the article or what about it kick started you?,83,16,12:02:46
Erica Yee,But the song itself has a very special place in my heart because an article my dad sent me about it kick-started my pop music nerdiness,135,26,10:59:28
Erica Yee,(which is called teenage dream)*,32,5,10:58:43
Erica Yee,Oh I meant the album in general (which includes teenage dream),62,11,10:58:32
Ben Fickes,Ooh thanks! And I can actually imagine both of those songs but donât know which I prefer haha,95,18,6:32:15
Erica Yee,(you're probably not much into katy perry but) i really don't like dark horse and that whole album. teenage dream was so much better,132,24,23:07:45
Erica Yee,if you were trying to find it,29,7,23:07:11
Erica Yee,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLeHuvHXuk,43,1,23:07:07
Erica Yee,lol i saw it was rogue like and i was like nah probably not (did get it though),79,18,23:06:42
Erica Yee,nice!,5,1,23:06:30
Ben Fickes,Moonlighter is pretty good. Rogue like which I like and you collect tons of loot and then sell it in your store (you donât know what itâs worth so you have to watch reactions and adjust prices appropriately). Maybe itâll get repetitive soon (itâs hard to get enough to make more progress) but definitely liking it rn,324,57,23:03:14
Ben Fickes,Ttyl and will do,16,4,21:33:44
Erica Yee,Lemme know what you think of the game,37,8,21:32:39
Erica Yee,Dinner now ttyl,15,3,21:32:33
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,21:32:27
Ben Fickes,My day was good! Not a lot of server work because of other bugs. But it was nice to have the break from it,106,24,21:31:40
Ben Fickes,Well good for you on that. And Iâm sorry. Rubbing your neck spiritually from afar haha,88,16,21:31:19
Erica Yee,How was your day,16,4,21:30:31
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Spent the whole day debugging huge 24 hours project that goes live tonight. Headache went away eventually but neck still kinda sore.,140,24,21:30:28
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,21:24:31
Erica Yee,omg lol,7,2,21:21:44
Ben Fickes,"Exactly just gotta average out. And my mom was so touched that your family sent me a card, I know sheâs been planning this since my birthday",142,27,20:55:36
Erica Yee,Your mom *also* sent a card.. so nice,37,8,20:14:04
Erica Yee,"No worries, it balances out with your gift ;)",45,9,20:13:49
Erica Yee,Omg thank you!,14,3,20:13:40
Ben Fickes,"Okay so was debating whether or not to make this a surprise but itâs really not haha, I sent you a birthday card but it may get there late because I just sent it now (sorry haha)",180,37,19:25:07
Erica Yee,Will probably eat during lol,28,5,19:09:22
Ben Fickes,Yeah it is even later. At least you can have dinner before this one hopefully?,78,15,17:53:51
Erica Yee,"Actually wait, last semester my evening class was 5:30-8:45 I think? This is even later yikes",93,16,17:49:21
Erica Yee,Guess I'm taking it instead of HCI ugh,38,8,17:48:14
Erica Yee,There's only 2 other people in the class right now,50,10,17:48:08
Erica Yee,Thanks :P,9,2,17:47:59
Ben Fickes,"Imagine if you were on co op next semester, youâd be in a real bind",69,15,17:43:58
Ben Fickes,Love the yelp change log haha. But that stinks about the class (though at least itâs not delaying you graduating). Iâll be your faithful IV large group reporter again haha,175,30,17:43:30
Erica Yee,It's 6-9:15pm Tuesdays.........,31,3,16:41:35
Erica Yee,"A ccis advisor just told me that I have to take the IS senior project class this semester, bc it will not be offered against till spring 2021 (they told me spring 2020 last year)",178,35,16:41:18
Erica Yee,Omg omg omgomg,14,3,16:39:46
Erica Yee,"Remember those contests in elementary school where you had to guess how many jelly beans were in the jar? Did you ever win one? Us neither, so it's a good thing we're all adults now and can go buy a bag of candy without all the hoopla. PS we fixed some bugs for this release...while eating gummy bears.",302,58,16:25:00
Erica Yee,"Because you indulge my changelog obsession, here's yelp's most recent:",70,10,16:24:58
Erica Yee,Cya,3,1,16:00:06
Ben Fickes,Revert is done so gtg,21,5,15:58:53
Ben Fickes,Yeah itâs our entire game (not live rn though). And oh my goodness haha well guess the more the merrier?,106,20,15:57:50
Erica Yee,"Our template for all projects uses this framework called ""Gatsby"" and yesterday I accidentally cloned a ""gatsb"" one and it won't delete so it's just chilling",157,26,15:52:25
Erica Yee,Omg lol. Is that like the repo?,31,7,15:51:33
Ben Fickes,I accidentally marked our entire depot for delete so Iâm waiting for it to revert haha,88,16,15:50:39
Ben Fickes,Thatâs good. Hope you keep feeling better :),46,8,15:50:17
Erica Yee,"Thanks, getting better after I took meds and coffee",51,9,15:49:55
Erica Yee,Yeah I think we have a good rapport now,39,9,15:49:34
Ben Fickes,"Oh glad it was good! Sorry about your head though, how do you feel now?",71,15,15:38:43
Erica Yee,"Started getting a headache so I was gonna get coffee, but then my coworker (the one who just graduated) was like ""I'm going down to get coffee, want anything?"" So we went together and it was good haha",200,38,14:16:30
Erica Yee,Sounds bad ð¬,15,3,13:43:38
Ben Fickes,But it locks people out of guild bosses theyâve summoned...,61,10,13:36:19
Ben Fickes,I didnât work on it so Iâm not helping with it,50,11,13:35:57
Ben Fickes,Wow a huge bug went live,24,6,13:35:45
Ben Fickes,Thanks!,7,1,12:38:15
Erica Yee,Good job!,9,2,12:28:05
Ben Fickes,Oh and I fixed a very urgent bug this morning which was good,60,13,12:21:25
Erica Yee,Omggg why,9,2,12:13:15
Ben Fickes,So we just had an engineering meeting we have every Tuesday and we talked about crash reporting. We pulled up the most recent crash and the players username was âpoopbuttstinkâ ð,185,31,12:06:10
Ben Fickes,Shem loves that song so much,28,6,12:06:07
Ben Fickes,"I know what you mean by that feeling, I usually think of it as being called out",79,17,12:04:28
Erica Yee,"Me: have you heard of the song old town road
Mom: no, is it Christian",69,15,11:21:19
Erica Yee,I feel chastised (idk if that the right word),45,9,11:03:26
Erica Yee,I thought he was the Christian and she was the atheist based on the picture,75,15,11:02:23
Erica Yee,I have to confess,17,4,11:02:09
Ben Fickes,Also it seems like it was mostly him driving continuing,55,10,6:56:09
Ben Fickes,But as we have talked about before I donât see how anything can work long term,80,16,6:35:39
Ben Fickes,I feel like a Christian and atheist could have a very good conversation like that,81,15,6:35:06
Ben Fickes,That is pretty interesting,26,4,6:34:49
Ben Fickes,Huh,3,1,6:34:35
Erica Yee,"him being atheist is ""non-negotiable"" for her but they say they're gonna keep seeing each other?",96,16,0:16:55
Erica Yee,omg this one https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2019/07/19/blind-date-devout-christian-and-atheist-classic/kPlVeF56FPfLtRmOP0Td0J/story.html,142,4,0:16:25
Erica Yee,Enjoy As well,13,3,22:41:54
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Going to sleep while you go to the gym so hope you enjoy haha,72,16,22:41:45
Erica Yee,Going to the gym now,20,5,22:41:06
Erica Yee,"It was fine, ended up not being busy since we couldn't work on the shooting interactive cuz didn't have enough information yet",126,22,22:40:58
Ben Fickes,"Going to bed soon but realized I did not ask, how was your day?",63,14,22:39:59
Ben Fickes,Haha yeah I read a solid chunk but thereâs a lot there,56,12,22:39:42
Erica Yee,(I didn't actually read it yet but I'm sure it's good lol),58,12,22:39:27
Ben Fickes,Yeah for real,13,3,22:39:25
Erica Yee,If there's a new game or it's an anniversary of the first game or something she could totally pitch a version to a games news site,130,26,22:37:31
Ben Fickes,His extra turn thing is pretty op,33,7,22:31:29
Ben Fickes,And nice! Heâs pretty good,28,5,22:31:22
Ben Fickes,Itâs actually super impressive haha,37,5,22:31:13
Erica Yee,I finally got sonic,19,4,22:30:16
Erica Yee,Wow I think that email is more words than I have done for all my co-ops combined,80,17,22:24:49
Ben Fickes,Haha ð now Iâm just imagining you playing it while listening to Christian music,84,14,22:23:34
Erica Yee,Eh only if it's a p&p&z game or something,41,9,22:23:07
Ben Fickes,Even though I know game design isnât your thing I feel like you know so much about Austen and you play games,110,22,22:22:25
Ben Fickes,I feel like you could design a good Austen game,47,10,22:21:57
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha,19,4,22:21:44
Erica Yee,(very short article),20,3,22:19:35
Erica Yee,Omg https://kotaku.com/jane-austen-video-game-mocks-a-society-obsessed-with-ma-1825964304,89,2,22:19:19
Erica Yee,I wonder if there's a Jane Austen vid game,42,9,22:17:54
Ben Fickes,If they get the rights in the next three weeks while Iâm still there that is haha,83,17,22:16:18
Ben Fickes,Haha if SEGA ever gets the rights to Jane Austen you will be the first person I ask,83,18,22:16:03
Erica Yee,It sounds like a police siren,29,6,22:15:20
Erica Yee,Omg lemme know if your team needs a summary of Jane Austen novels,65,13,22:15:07
Ben Fickes,And haha please show me what HhMmMm does sound like sometime,60,11,22:14:43
Ben Fickes,Also the designer told everyone about the email at a meeting and someone said âwe should send bens friend a t shirt or something as thanks!â WHAT I DONT EVEN HAVE A T SHIRT,176,34,22:14:18
Erica Yee,"So I realize I don't actually do that in real life, I just do HMMmm",67,15,22:14:06
Erica Yee,I just tried to HmMmMm out loud and my family looked at me like I was crazy,75,17,22:13:44
Ben Fickes,Okay gonna do it now,20,5,22:13:31
Erica Yee,Please do,9,2,22:13:25
Ben Fickes,I can forward you the email. I havenât even finished reading it but itâs so funny and you can hear her voice narrating it,125,24,22:13:15
Erica Yee,Omg you asked the right person,30,6,22:13:00
Ben Fickes,Because what she sent is practically a novel,44,8,22:12:51
Ben Fickes,But I think she just spent a solid few days writing the whole time,66,14,22:12:41
Ben Fickes,She said it might be a few days so I said no rush,49,13,22:12:28
Ben Fickes,But I know RenÃ©e owns one of them so I asked if she could email me a short summary if she had time so that I could show my coworkers,133,30,22:12:19
Ben Fickes,So at my work the designers need to learn about yakuza (a game series) but none of them know about it,101,21,22:11:55
Ben Fickes,No your âhhhmmmâ just made me think of you saying that,58,11,22:11:29
Erica Yee,Don't think so,14,3,22:11:09
Erica Yee,Interestingggggggggggg,22,1,22:11:04
Erica Yee,What's interesting,18,2,22:11:00
Ben Fickes,Also know youâre at dinner but did I ever tell you about RenÃ©e and the yakuza email?,87,17,21:45:30
Ben Fickes,Sorry had to reply to that too haha,35,8,21:16:00
Ben Fickes,Interestingggggggggggg,22,1,21:15:53
Ben Fickes,Have fun with dinner,20,4,21:15:43
Ben Fickes,"I also enjoyed this conversation very much, thank you ð",58,10,21:15:39
Erica Yee,But o enjoyed this conversation very much,41,7,21:15:15
Erica Yee,"Ok I should be actually helpful to prep for dinner, ttyl",56,11,21:15:07
Erica Yee,HmMmMm,6,1,21:14:53
Ben Fickes,I was gonna snap you but then got distracted and forgot about it until now haha,79,16,21:14:10
Ben Fickes,I saw an AirPod on the ground and it instantly made me think of a story where someone tries to find the owner,109,23,21:13:57
Ben Fickes,And oh that reminds me of something today,41,8,21:13:14
Ben Fickes,I can try to add it to my story folder later,44,11,21:13:07
Erica Yee,"I also have ""airpods"" on my to-do list and need to make that doc",64,14,21:13:02
Erica Yee,I should write this down,24,5,21:12:48
Ben Fickes,Ah I see,8,3,21:12:41
Erica Yee,Or like there is an external system,35,7,21:12:27
Ben Fickes,I think it could be with or without gaming the system,53,11,21:12:06
Ben Fickes,And thatâs true,17,3,21:11:56
Ben Fickes,Wow it shows how much Iâve come to learn about romance books from you,71,14,21:11:53
Erica Yee,"Anyway, ours would have the game the system element",51,9,21:11:35
Erica Yee,And you were not wrong,22,5,21:11:17
Erica Yee,"I remember you saying ""I predict they will date"" or something like that",71,13,21:11:14
Ben Fickes,I actually remember you telling me about that book specifically,63,10,21:10:53
Erica Yee,But they set each other up with people they know,48,10,21:10:18
Erica Yee,"This sorta reminds me of this book I read last semester, Josh and Hazel's guide to not dating",93,18,21:10:06
Ben Fickes,I will ATL indeed,17,4,21:08:52
Ben Fickes,"I knew instantly and I love it, thank you haha",46,10,21:08:46
Erica Yee,(my new acronym for add to list),32,7,21:08:29
Erica Yee,Omg that reminds me of very small emoji story that happened today. Can you ATL please,85,16,21:08:18
Ben Fickes,And technically I do owe you a story still as a Christmas present,65,13,21:00:37
Ben Fickes,Unfortunately I did not make them while I texted,48,9,21:00:19
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad haha,15,3,21:00:10
Erica Yee,Also I really appreciate the emojis,35,6,20:56:36
Erica Yee,I think you should write it,27,6,20:56:27
Ben Fickes,Oh they could do it as friends and get paired with other people and talk about it. And they start falling in love but donât know how to say it. And then they get paired up and thatâs their actual first date and they talk about how they feel,244,49,20:53:55
Ben Fickes,Jk that actually could be really interesting,44,7,20:53:05
Ben Fickes,But then... they fall in love? ðð®ð¤­ so shocking,55,9,20:52:56
Erica Yee,Maybe they're best friends trying to get as many free meals as they can together,80,15,20:51:19
Erica Yee,I smell a plot,14,4,20:50:24
Ben Fickes,But if we could make so that it was only us in the pool every time...,69,16,20:43:32
Ben Fickes,Thatâs what I mean by I know thatâs not how it works haha,61,13,20:42:47
Erica Yee,Oooh but what if they keep matching us with other people,56,11,20:41:41
Ben Fickes,Or every date if we made up fake identities and backstories for each one,72,14,20:40:21
Ben Fickes,I see. Dang we couldâve had our first date on the globe (I know thatâs not how it works haha),97,20,20:40:00
Erica Yee,"some rare people will say they want to, but you never know if they actual5 go on a second date",94,20,20:38:07
Erica Yee,I read a lot more when I still had a cheap student globe sub,60,14,20:37:32
Ben Fickes,Oh wow thatâs very interesting. Thanks for the background haha. Have you read many? Like do people ever go on second dates?,125,22,20:36:01
Erica Yee,Honestly one of the best parts of the globe,43,9,19:56:46
Erica Yee,"So the globe does these (monthly?) ""Dinner with Cupid"" where people apply and then get matched up. They go on a blind date and the globe pays for their meal. Then they report back and give each other grades",206,39,19:56:25
Erica Yee,I forgot they don't write a background graf,43,8,19:55:28
Erica Yee,LOL sorry I should've explained,31,5,19:55:14
Ben Fickes,Okay so I read it and I feel very confused by the grades haha. But isnât it just that they went on a date and then didnât  continue (and wrote about it)? I think Iâm missing part of it sorry haha,201,41,19:52:47
Ben Fickes,Oh I canât wait to read this,30,7,18:44:02
Erica Yee,This is hilarious if you have time This guy omg https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2019/07/26/blind-date-uncommonly-ambitious-for-academic/w0WzWjPwy2GCn3umtjU27N/story.html,174,11,18:12:04

Erica Yee,Awful shooting at the garlic festival a few hours south yesterday (idk if you heard) so newsroom is kinda crazy rn,114,21,12:20:46

Erica Yee,"No (it's more complicated but I don't have full information so don't want to tell, sorry)",89,16,12:18:47
Ben Fickes,"So at work today, the save was still messed up like I told you about. Spent the whole morning working on it and turns out the only issue was that my manager pushed changes and I never pulled because I didnât know they were there. All better now haha",251,49,12:02:11
Ben Fickes,Are Calvinâs friends dating?,30,4,12:01:20
Ben Fickes,Oh dang haha,12,3,12:01:12
Erica Yee,"At Yosemite, Calvin's friends used the white noise machine in their Airbnb bedroom but one said she couldn't sleep because she could detect the pattern of the cricket noises",173,29,11:06:16
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,11:05:25
Erica Yee,Husbands or husbands',21,3,11:04:58
Ben Fickes,Last night Thiago made Alexa play ocean sounds on loop haha. And I woke up and they were still playing haha,107,21,6:33:55
Ben Fickes,It has been added haha. Is it âthe husbands clubâ or âthe husbandâs club?â Just because each puts a slightly different idea in my head,144,25,6:33:15
Erica Yee,"Add to list: I have a sorta book idea called ""the husbands club"" that I don't actually want to write but is kinda interesting",125,24,0:57:34
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,23:26:12
Ben Fickes,"Alright going to bed, goodnight",31,5,23:25:59
Erica Yee,Yep of course,13,3,23:25:10
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing :),21,4,23:24:22
Ben Fickes,"Oh I donât know if you did, but that is so cool",49,12,23:24:18
Erica Yee,(also sorry to change the subject back slightly but did I tell you that all the content for the homelessness q&a is pulled from a Google doc? So cool),150,29,23:22:13
Erica Yee,Glad you guys got closer,24,5,23:21:37
Erica Yee,Ooh that's great,16,3,23:21:33
Ben Fickes,And I will share it by phone another time. But I realized I havenât ever really asked about him and RenÃ©e or talked about us. And after we talked for a while he said that he thinks RenÃ©e and I are very similar in our fears and worries and insecurities in relationships and that she could probably give me advice on it. So anyways am excited to talk to you about all of it and Iâll probably reach out ot her,412,81,23:19:38
Ben Fickes,So I just had a long and deep talk with Shem about relationships,64,13,23:18:17
Ben Fickes,Ooh thanks for sharing. And haha little kids love snow,54,10,23:18:03
Erica Yee,"Oh also one more thing about that new family at church, their 5 year old was like ""I don't like the weather here. When it's winter I want to go back to Boston!"" Haha",165,34,22:36:00
Erica Yee,Yep!,4,1,22:26:26
Erica Yee,Lemme check,11,2,22:25:02
Erica Yee,"So much of the bay area is not zoned for dense housing (i.e. not single family home), which is what we need a lot more of to ease the housing shortage, which is a big part of the homelessness crisis",198,40,22:24:59
Ben Fickes,For purposes of documenting this bug haha,41,7,21:43:28
Ben Fickes,Oh also is the red dot gone in SEGA heroes,42,10,21:43:21
Ben Fickes,What do you mean by that,24,6,21:31:30
Erica Yee,The problem is more the zoning stuff actually,45,8,21:25:16
Erica Yee,And yeah yikes,14,3,21:24:56
Erica Yee,"Ah thanks, I appreciate it",26,5,21:24:53
Ben Fickes,Read your homelessness article (or several sections of it). Did not know the cost for one unit of affordable housing is $700K in SF...,134,24,20:55:50
Ben Fickes,It's the best of both worlds because we can laugh and reuse the jokes later if we need to,89,19,20:55:11
Erica Yee,I really appreciate how we tell each other jokes we don't actually make,71,13,20:52:12
Ben Fickes,Was gonna make a joke about you being worth the violence but realized it could be taken out of context to sound really terrible haha,132,25,20:49:37
Ben Fickes,Ofc you're more than worth it,29,6,20:49:04
Erica Yee,Thank you for enduring gratuitous violence and unnecessary dirty humor to play the game I like,94,16,20:48:18
Erica Yee,Ohh lol,7,2,20:47:35
Ben Fickes,"And thank you, but you are definitely the better out of us when it comes to FPS's",81,17,20:46:59

Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Was this the first time ever youâve done both?,56,10,15:19:02
Erica Yee,I still prefer just to play piano so I don't have to multitask as much but at least I know I can do it if necessary,115,26,15:17:55
Erica Yee,(that's not the reason but it is for me),40,9,15:16:48
Erica Yee,It was fine haha. We have the band in the back facing the same way as the congregation so it's less nerve-wracking,114,22,15:16:38
Ben Fickes,How do you feel now about the fact you were vocals?,51,11,15:01:53
Ben Fickes,Dang well way to go,19,5,15:01:26
Erica Yee,Though many technical difficulties with the missions sharing and I had to hotspot my dad's laptop,97,16,15:00:48
Ben Fickes,Glad it was good!,17,4,15:00:39
Ben Fickes,Praise God that praising God went well,38,7,15:00:35
Erica Yee,It actually went very well praise God,37,7,15:00:11
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,14:59:57
Ben Fickes,Jk I know what you meant,24,6,12:55:38
Ben Fickes,Oh glad he figured it out haha. And I hate to break it to you but youâre his posterity haha,93,20,12:55:33
Erica Yee,"So it's fixed now, and it is confirmed that my dad is the only one who truly knows how to set up sound which is bad for posterity lol",133,29,12:51:08
Erica Yee,15 mins before service,22,4,12:50:38
Erica Yee,Omg we were having very frustrating sound problems and then my dad figured out the person who set up swapped 2 important cords,126,23,12:50:32
Erica Yee,Ooh nice ok,11,3,12:50:04
Ben Fickes,Pastor Johnson preached and he talks so much about all sorts of stuff that he always says something controversial eventually haha,129,21,12:46:13
Ben Fickes,"Alright cool! Church was pretty good, have some thoughts on the sermon I can tell you while we shoot things in borderlands haha",127,23,12:45:45
Erica Yee,How was church for you,22,5,12:28:22

Ben Fickes,Hmmm I donât think so,23,5,12:27:13
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,12:27:09
Erica Yee,Did I send it to you before?,28,7,12:27:07
Ben Fickes,Hope service goes well,22,4,12:27:05
Erica Yee,Really like this one song we're leading called the kingdom is yours,67,12,12:27:02
Ben Fickes,Oh nice,7,2,12:27:01
Erica Yee,It is actually,14,3,12:26:15
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Is your head alright?,29,5,11:44:28

Ben Fickes,How are you feeling?,20,4,11:30:45
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,11:27:14
Ben Fickes,"This is amazing, thank you so much for sharing haha. I hope you wake up rested enough and that things go well at church today!",126,25,7:55:43
Erica Yee,ð hope you appreciate,24,4,4:02:31
Erica Yee,"Mine:
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
My soul is feeling resistant
I know that Your spirit's persistent
But everything means nothing if I don't have You",156,28,4:02:24
Erica Yee,"Original:
Oh, I'm good at keepin' my distance
I know that you're the feelin' I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it But everything means nothin' if I can't have you",170,33,4:01:38
Erica Yee,Soooo it's 1am and really need to sleep but just wanted to tell you: my dad rewrote the chorus for if I can't have you and we were just gonna do that. But when I was waiting for my sister to finish washing up in the bathroom I was like hmm what if I changed the rest of the song too. So I took a stab at it and tweaked it to be Christiany in like 5 minutes haha. Don't think we're gonna do this whole thing tomorrow but it was fun. I'm most proud of the prechorus because of my rhymes haha,489,103,4:01:09
Erica Yee,You're welcome :) thanks for being so honest and sweet and encouraging,70,12,0:44:59
Ben Fickes,"Alright gonna sleep now, hope you have a good time at the gym. Wanted to say thanks again for spending so much time talking, you truly are amazing and Iâm blessed to be dating someone who cares so much about me",212,41,0:27:41
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,0:26:53
Erica Yee,Ooh glad you enjoyed it,23,5,0:20:26
Ben Fickes,"Finished the movie, it was pretty good and suspenseful. Itâs a shapeshifting alien so itâs all about whoâs the shapeshifter. Most people die ofc and ending is ambiguous",174,28,0:16:23
Ben Fickes,Haha I think your social media habits are just fine,51,10,0:15:32
Erica Yee,I just have weird social media habits haha oh well,50,10,0:13:53
Erica Yee,"Slightly awk cuz one of Calvin's friends followed me right before I posted, and I didn't follow back (I only follow people I actually know and care about lol) and then I didn't post any pictures of him or the other friend, because I didn't have any that they were in but I wasn't",279,54,0:13:19
Erica Yee,You're welcome,14,2,0:12:14

Ben Fickes,It actually is a dream come true,32,7,0:05:28
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,0:05:28
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much Erica :) it really means the world to me that you listen and give such insight (oftentimes insight I could never have) to the songs I send and send songs that are meaningful to you to me,204,41,0:04:56
Erica Yee,"Just wanted to say that I'm at the gym and listening to music, including revival (one I sent you) and the Lecrae version of this is living. Thanks again for starting the music emails, it gives songs  greater meaning because we shared them and brings me a lot of joy",265,50,23:56:26
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,23:54:51
Ben Fickes,But I know itâs not about that and itâs about worship so glad youâre focused on that haha,95,18,23:46:05
Ben Fickes,I honestly think your voice is beautiful,40,7,23:45:46
Erica Yee,Which I need to not feel self conscious about my voice haha,59,12,23:44:42
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm always so nervous but when I get in the groove I feel God's presence and it's everything,97,19,23:44:24
Ben Fickes,I know itâs easy for me to say having never led worship though,64,13,23:37:17
Ben Fickes,I know itâs not as chill as percussion but I really think youâll do a great job. And itâs not about how you do ofc itâs worshipping God,143,28,23:36:11
Erica Yee,While he chills on percussion,29,5,23:31:30
Erica Yee,My dad is making me lead singing and piano for all the songs including the Spanish one..,88,17,23:31:23
Ben Fickes,I wish I was at your church tomorrow haha,41,9,23:29:33
Erica Yee,We've done whole rewrites of royals and what makes you beautiful,64,11,23:28:49
Ben Fickes,Thatâs what I do in my head all the time haha,47,11,23:28:37
Ben Fickes,I love it,9,3,23:28:30
Erica Yee,My dad rewrote the chorus to be about God,41,9,23:27:55
Erica Yee,If I can't have you,19,5,23:27:42
Ben Fickes,I love it so much haha. What is the Shawn mendes song,53,12,23:22:37
Erica Yee,But why is my dad so extra,26,7,23:06:33
Erica Yee,Well we are doing the mashup tomorrow,37,7,23:06:29
Erica Yee,Instead of actually practicing,30,4,23:06:19
Erica Yee,We are mashing up build my life and a Shawn Mendes song,55,12,23:06:10
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,23:05:54
Ben Fickes,Apparently itâs sci-fi thriller not horror,44,6,22:28:57
Ben Fickes,Iâll let you know how it is. But I might forget to tonight and tell you about it tomorrow,91,19,22:28:40
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,22:28:09
Ben Fickes,Itâs an old movie so Iâm hoping itâs not as scary haha,60,12,22:21:51
Ben Fickes,Weâre watching The Thing,26,4,22:21:39
Ben Fickes,They did I think. Havenât asked them about it but Shem will spoil it haha,75,15,22:21:34
Erica Yee,Did they finish Beale at yesterday?,35,6,22:21:08
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,22:20:56
Ben Fickes,Also might be watching a horror movie with my roommates. Why did I agree to this...,83,16,22:12:43
Ben Fickes,Itâll be fine though I know,29,6,22:12:22
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,22:09:51
Ben Fickes,"Like I mean Iâm worried I wonât have enough time to do all the stuff I want (spend time with you, spend time with roommates, other friends, dnd)",148,28,22:07:58
Ben Fickes,You gotta disguise me as an inanimate object,44,8,22:07:24
Erica Yee,What do you mean worries about free time,40,8,22:07:23
Erica Yee,We'll figure something out (I need you there please lol),56,10,22:07:04
Ben Fickes,Yeah I remember that haha,25,5,22:06:47
Ben Fickes,Oh haha buhbye then,19,4,22:06:42
Erica Yee,But Barbara strongly dislikes him/him coming over agh,53,8,22:06:37
Ben Fickes,He actually messaged me recently to say hi. Iâm slightly worried about free time next semester but Iâd be down (if everyone means me),137,24,22:06:33
Erica Yee,Oh he meant my roommates,24,5,22:06:27
Erica Yee,Idk how possible that is but guess we have to be more intentional about hanging out regularly..,95,17,22:05:34
Erica Yee,"Talking to Victor and I think he wants some sort of weekly dinner in the fall with ""everyone"" (idk who that means)",114,22,22:05:15
Erica Yee,Hey if it's clearly still a bill I can send it to the treasury department for a replacement haha,96,19,22:03:06
Ben Fickes,OH NO I enclosed thousands of dollars of bills within the letterâs paper but you probably destroyed it all,108,19,21:57:02
Erica Yee,Aw I'm glad. You're so welcome,30,6,21:56:26
Erica Yee,Also did I tell you that I accidentally cut part of your letter when I was opening it ð,90,19,21:56:15
Ben Fickes,"Also wanted to say Iâm feeling much better now, thank you for listening so much earlier",89,16,21:55:07
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð oh my goodness thatâs amazing. Donât worry I wonât tell her. Glad you like it though,100,18,21:53:30
Erica Yee,I love it but gonna wait till my bday to say thanks,51,12,21:52:05
Erica Yee,Don't tell her,14,3,21:51:52
Erica Yee,OMG I accidentally opened your mom's gift,41,7,21:51:47
Erica Yee,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/HarlemBrownstones.JPG,73,1,16:32:44

Ben Fickes,"I gotta go for dnd but lemme know whenever you wanna talk, and hope dim sum is good",83,18,13:17:13
Ben Fickes,Oh no,5,2,13:16:51
Erica Yee,No haha it's at a legit indoors theater in SF,45,10,13:16:02
Erica Yee,But thank you!,14,3,13:15:49
Erica Yee,Oops I accidentally just insulted my mom in the process,55,10,13:15:38
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I mean I trust you, itâs your birthday present so itâs definitely your call and Iâm good with whatever. And thatâs awesome you get to see it! Is it at the same place we went to",189,37,13:14:34
Erica Yee,(of course the two of us just hung out at his house yesterday alone so idk why my mom is worried about optics),110,23,13:11:54
Erica Yee,But I felt like I could ask you anyway,38,9,13:10:39
Erica Yee,"(I thought it was fine but my mom was like ""isn't there anyone else"" and then I said ""I'll ask Ben if you think it's weird"" and then she said ""no don't ask him, THAT'S weird""",174,36,13:10:11
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah my parents bought Hamilton tickets for my birthday. it's 1pm so my sister can't go, and my dad was going to go but he forgot he's going to be in Florida. So I was thinking about asking Calvin cuz he's a huge fan. Is it ok with you if I go with him rather than a girl friend?",282,60,13:09:03
Erica Yee,Sounds sad,10,2,13:05:43
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs good. It was pretty interesting, I think I saw probably a little less than an hour. Itâs a couple, the guy gets arrested for a crime he didnât commit and the girl is pregnant while heâs in jail. Sheâs 19 and heâs 21 or 22 I think. And her family is very supportive of the baby while his family is not",319,62,12:59:12
Erica Yee,Did you end up seeing a substantial part of any movie,53,11,12:56:31

Ben Fickes,Haha thank you anyways,22,4,12:40:05
Ben Fickes,I think when you lose the level up quest it still stays around for notification until the next day,98,19,12:39:15
Erica Yee,Darn I really wanted to catch a new bug,39,9,12:39:14
Ben Fickes,Okay I think I know what this is. It should be gone tomorrow (sorry haha),73,15,12:38:17

Ben Fickes,"Wait, what level are you?",25,5,12:37:21
Ben Fickes,Oh I think thatâs a bug assigned to me haha. But I didnât realize youâd be seeing it,90,18,12:37:15
Erica Yee,Is this a bug? The notification dot won't go away even though I have nothing to claim,85,17,12:35:05
Erica Yee,Yah don't worry haha,20,4,12:34:19
Ben Fickes,Did want to say - if dim sum goes long or youâre hanging out with friends after please donât feel like you have to cut it short,131,27,7:56:09
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,1:42:07

Erica Yee,Honestly very slowly,20,3,1:38:04
Ben Fickes,I should really go to bed now,29,7,1:37:56
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I was gonna ask you how youâre able to read my handwriting,70,14,1:37:39
Erica Yee,Mysteries,9,1,1:37:05
Ben Fickes,What was the word?,18,4,1:35:38
Ben Fickes,Oh really! Iâm so excited to read it ð,43,9,1:34:58
Erica Yee,Ok now I have to actually finish it,35,8,1:33:15
Erica Yee,"Side note 3: I was in the process of writing you a poem before receiving your letter, so I swear I'm not copying you copying me!!",129,26,1:33:07
Erica Yee,"Side note 1: I do appreciate the well places ""thee"" you know me so well
Side note 2: I was gonna ask you what a word us, but I felt bad about asking, but then I finally figured it out and now I don't have to ask, but I'm still telling you because I think it's funny",265,57,1:32:13
Erica Yee,Will I get to see my own face face to face,42,11,1:31:00
Ben Fickes,"And I think is because a mirror image is seeing something indirectly - youâre not looking at it, and if itâs not a clear mirror like we have today itâs not the whole image. But when you see the real thing directly, itâs the real thing",242,46,1:30:21
Ben Fickes,I think itâs in 1 corinthians 13,34,7,1:29:32
Erica Yee,I never really got the analogy but I like that part,51,11,1:29:24
Ben Fickes,Yes!,4,1,1:29:23
Erica Yee,Ooh is that the mirror verse,28,6,1:29:10
Ben Fickes,"And I have some thoughts on that actually Iâll tell you about tomorrow. But I agree. I think about the joy I have in knowing you and being known by you. And it is so, so good. But I always think of the verse âthen I shall know fully, even as I am fully knownâ and I think about finally seeing God and knowing the fullness of His love",339,69,1:25:08
Ben Fickes,I am so glad you liked it :) I honestly felt like my poetry was a step down from yours haha. But Iâm so glad you liked it,123,28,1:23:23
Erica Yee,"At the end I had a very profound feeling that I've done nothing to deserve your love, but how much more God loves me beyond what I can ever imagine. What we have is so good but it's just a glimpse of that",204,43,1:22:19
Erica Yee,Good writer* LOL whoops,23,4,1:19:58

Ben Fickes,Haha ð there was romance though,34,6,0:32:49
Erica Yee,Yep. Wasn't a huge fan honestly. I like plot haha,49,10,0:30:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah saw that it was by same director as moonlight. Did you see that?,69,14,0:30:12
Erica Yee,Think it won something at the Oscars last year,46,9,0:29:47
Erica Yee,Based on James baldwin book and directed by Barry Jenkins (moonlight),69,11,0:29:36
Erica Yee,Yeah heard of it,16,4,0:29:03

Ben Fickes,Oh are you doing alright btw? Know things went well but know youâre probably also tired haha,94,17,0:12:38
Ben Fickes,I was singing it to myself the whole way home haha,50,11,0:12:16
Ben Fickes,I think so. I just remember lecrae from it haha,47,10,0:11:57
Erica Yee,"I forgot there was a Lecrae version, I usually listen to the acoustic one",73,14,0:11:52
Erica Yee,Ooh the Hillsong young and free one?,36,7,0:11:23
Ben Fickes,Oh very random but I listened to one of the Capital kings songs you sent me and then listened to capital kings a lot at work. And I ended up listening to âthis is livingâ a ton - I love lecraes part so much. Anyways just wanted to share,240,49,0:02:21
Erica Yee,Nice xD,7,2,23:51:14
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Thatâs awesome! Dan says he sits two desks away from barbs haha,76,14,23:50:21

Ben Fickes,Gotcha. And wow thatâs crazy! Did they talk,45,8,23:48:25
Erica Yee,Omgggg my sister's college roommate is visiting and they went to a restaurant called tofu house. They happened to get seated next to people who were on her plane from Vegas ð®ð®ð®,185,32,23:47:54
Erica Yee,"Yeah he was alright, going to the gym with his brother now which is good (he's a lot older so they're not that close but trying to bond more)",141,29,23:47:35
Ben Fickes,Was he doing alright?,21,4,23:44:56
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Glad heâs doing well and you guys had fun,52,11,23:44:41

Ben Fickes,Lemme know how it goes please,29,6,21:17:09
Ben Fickes,Oh glad to hear it. Hope things are good,40,9,21:16:58
Erica Yee,"Alright I'm at Calvin's now, he seems much better than he was on the phone yesterday",84,16,21:16:26
Erica Yee,It's actually quite fascinating because we usually see disproportionate numbers of every other ethnicity group and then only a few white people,143,22,21:16:01
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, I try haha. Yeah Matt has mentioned things about Costco being a favorite of Chinese people",98,17,21:06:48
Erica Yee,Umm like everyone Chinese in the bay area frequents Costco haha,63,11,21:06:19
Erica Yee,"Dang probably, your memory is so good",37,7,21:05:54
Ben Fickes,What do you mean by in your circles? Like just the people you know?,67,14,21:04:49
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I remember you saying when your parents saw him (I think),67,13,21:04:30
Erica Yee,And sure enough he ran into one of  Julia's friends from HS lol,63,13,21:04:12
Erica Yee,"In our circles, It's where you're bound to run into someone you know, which I highly dislike",92,17,21:03:52
Ben Fickes,Haha okay not a bad place to be,31,8,21:01:42
Erica Yee,"Yeah he's ok now, at Costco haha",32,7,21:00:16

Ben Fickes,Do you know if heâs sober now?,32,7,20:59:11
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,20:59:04
Erica Yee,"No he lives with his parents, but they own a restaurant so they're not often home",81,16,20:58:42
Ben Fickes,Does he live alone?,19,4,20:57:36
Ben Fickes,I gotcha. I think youâve mentioned him drinking before. Iâm glad you can be there for him,93,17,20:57:30
Erica Yee,"Besides companionship ofc, I wanna make sure he actually eats real food at a decent time and doesn't drink too much",115,21,20:56:31

Ben Fickes,Sorry to hear that about work. Is it done now or carrying over?,63,13,21:38:41
Ben Fickes,"If thereâs anything I can do lemme know. And itâs not on you to determine their fates if that makes sense, Iâm sure whatever you will do will help but Iâm sure this stems from their past",194,37,21:38:28

Erica Yee,"I finally have a free weekend night for the first time in a while. (Not that I'm complaining, but need some down time haha)",123,24,14:53:14
Erica Yee,Can you do tomorrow night?,26,5,14:52:34
Ben Fickes,"Also, do you wanna talk sometime this weekend? I can do tonight too but know youâre probably busy with the movie",114,21,14:41:55
Ben Fickes,Haha glad she gets a day off though,35,8,14:41:26
Erica Yee,"She's actually taking a ""stress"" day off tomorrow, but only because she accumulated too many sick days and needs to use some loo",128,23,14:25:50
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,14:25:24
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Well thatâs good thereâs an end in sight at least, even though itâs sad itâll be after youâre back in school",126,22,13:53:42
Erica Yee,"Oh yah she hired like 4 or 5 people, Including a manager who started a few weeks ago. But the transition is pretty slow so she probably has to keep doing it till September",171,34,13:15:13
Ben Fickes,Oh she was able to hire one? Does that mean she gets to stop her manager stuff now haha?,88,19,13:01:11
Erica Yee,"My mom's bringing one of the social workers she just hired bc ""you will have to deal with this a lot"" LOL",105,22,12:54:14
Erica Yee,"Also the grandma's sister, who first decided to keep the news from her, is playing herself",90,16,12:52:09
Erica Yee,Probably not cuz it's mostly in English,39,7,12:51:34
Ben Fickes,Is there any chance sheâs gonna watch the movie?,50,9,12:49:36
Ben Fickes,Oh dang I did not know that,27,7,12:49:20

Ben Fickes,Josh sent me this this morning haha,35,7,12:12:04
Ben Fickes,My days been pretty good. Not much has happened haha. I cooked myself a quesadilla for lunch (using leftover veggies) before work after my run so was very proud of myself haha,175,32,12:11:50
Ben Fickes,"I still donât get how victor can equate agape, his church, her, and Christianity. Not to be judgmental though. And yikes indeed, Iâm sorry it came to that but I hope it helps him",182,34,12:10:44
Erica Yee,How's your day going,20,4,11:32:47
Erica Yee,And Calvin had to block his ex on multiple platforms yikes,58,11,11:32:27
Erica Yee,"Yeah the ongoing intertwined church/kimchimberly (lol forgot about that till now, thanks for reminding me) stuff",112,16,11:30:52
Ben Fickes,"And on the bright side, I have no girl problems to talk to you about haha",73,16,6:36:18
Ben Fickes,Sorry joking aside sorry you have to talk with both of them about it. But glad youâre there. Is it kimchimberly stuff for victor or something else?,149,27,6:35:52
Ben Fickes,"Argh, that be mighty unfortunate, me hearty ð´ââ ï¸",57,9,6:34:52
Erica Yee,argh talking with both calvin and victor about girl problems,60,10,1:05:53
Erica Yee,"Just wanted to let you know that after having several unrelated conversations in between, Victor asked how getting towed on Sunday was HAHA",139,23,23:27:57
Erica Yee,I hope he has good hair under that,34,8,23:08:22
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,23:07:31
Ben Fickes,"Alright gonna sleep now, goodnight",34,5,23:07:23
Erica Yee,Yup haha,8,2,23:06:34
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I have nothing witty to say to that haha, I hope not",57,13,23:04:16
Erica Yee,Haha hope Yosemite is not burned down or flooded by then (when either is a possibility in California yikes),107,19,23:01:51
Ben Fickes,Just do it again in your 70s to prove yourself,46,10,22:59:01
Ben Fickes,Dang your dad isnât pulling any punches haha. I think you have a right to be sore,83,17,22:58:45
Erica Yee,ð ok not everybody can hike half dome like you or my grandpa in his 70s,74,16,22:58:37
Erica Yee,"Me: think the hike to Columbia point was the most strenuous I've ever done
Dad: you need to hike more",101,20,22:58:15
Erica Yee,And yeah thanks. I'm actually still a bit sore which my dad is incredulous about,80,15,22:57:51
Erica Yee,Haha omg,8,2,22:57:34
Ben Fickes,And I promise Iâm not actually crazy haha,43,8,22:57:03
Ben Fickes,Thank you for being you,23,5,22:56:52
Ben Fickes,HAHA guess you still have more of me to get to know ð,56,13,22:56:22
Erica Yee,Thanks for not being crazy ð¬,31,6,22:55:57
Ben Fickes,And hope the gym is good,24,6,22:55:33
Ben Fickes,Yeah of course,14,3,22:55:29
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I appreciate it",23,4,22:55:05
Ben Fickes,Dang. Well not that I can really do anything but if I can do anything for you or him lemme know,95,21,22:53:16
Erica Yee,Yeah he's not doing great rn,28,6,22:52:02
Ben Fickes,Is it hard on him? Iâm assuming so if heâs talking to you about it,70,15,22:51:26
Erica Yee,Mhmm,4,1,22:51:04
Ben Fickes,Dang that is tough. And thatâs hard for him to handle because he canât really confront her either,101,18,22:44:38
Erica Yee,She has some mental health issues and (imo) uses it to guilt him..,66,13,22:40:16
Erica Yee,"Basically they had an agreement not to talk, but she still reaches out to him when she's feeling bad and she doesn't have many other close friends (especially girls)",165,29,22:39:57
Ben Fickes,Thatâs probably where Iâm getting it from haha,50,8,22:39:35
Erica Yee,I sorta feel the same,21,5,22:39:10
Erica Yee,Yeah I get that,15,4,22:39:06
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope your class thing works out. And I say this realizing that this i am fully ignorant of the situation but my feelings are that I have no idea how he can have so much drama over this. Again I know itâs probably more complex so I donât really mean that but anyways just from hearing from you thatâs how I feel,324,63,22:32:41
Erica Yee,Now going to the gym. Also helping Calvin deal with his ex again ughhh,70,14,22:16:30
Erica Yee,"It was ok, kinda slow for once. I watched a required webinar ok fact checking. Then in the afternoon I wrote a long email to my coding for digital storytelling teacher asking for advice about what design class to take",217,40,22:14:58
Erica Yee,And I definitely do that lol,28,6,22:13:41
Erica Yee,Ouch,4,1,22:13:34
Ben Fickes,How was work,12,3,22:06:38
Ben Fickes,Was filling my water bottle while texting you and it overflowed haha,68,12,22:06:32
Ben Fickes,Yep. But we got shot by arrows once for guessing wrong,54,11,22:05:38
Erica Yee,Did you guys figure it out,26,6,22:01:09
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,22:01:03
Ben Fickes,Michael made a logic puzzle for our dnd session,47,9,21:30:15
Ben Fickes,Yeah I guess mobile crowd must prefer different art,51,9,17:59:15
Erica Yee,Trying to get a different audience I guess,42,8,14:26:35
Ben Fickes,Oh dang that doesnât sound ver AC like haha,45,9,14:12:15
Erica Yee,"So I played the AC mobile game for 10 mins and then uninstalled it lol. The cutesyness is a little unnerving and you only can move and fight in very rigid ways (""press the door to move to the next room"" without a d-pad!)",220,44,13:21:15
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,13:17:08
Ben Fickes,"Nvm, have seen it haha",22,5,13:03:39
Ben Fickes,Wait what is that,17,4,12:44:24
Erica Yee,Lol just read about the bare feet controversy,45,8,12:12:28
Ben Fickes,His intro video is super creepy,31,6,12:07:41
Ben Fickes,"All my knowledge is secondhand haha, idk his attacks but I think ult is slamming people into air then ground",108,20,12:07:12
Ben Fickes,"Sigma. Whole theme is manipulating gravity, heâs a tank",57,9,12:06:33
Erica Yee,Or I can look on polygon,24,6,12:06:12
Erica Yee,What is it,10,3,12:06:03
Erica Yee,No?!,4,1,12:06:00
Ben Fickes,Random but did you hear thereâs a new Overwatch character?,60,10,12:05:39
Ben Fickes,No worries! And haha thanks for sharing. Weâll have to combine that with our AirPods ideas,92,16,12:05:23
Erica Yee,Sorry got diverted cuz I had to open a door,43,10,12:04:36
Ben Fickes,"I think itâs not loading, whatever you sent, sorry",52,9,12:03:25

Erica Yee,fav pic from two truck,22,5,0:36:58
Erica Yee,aw that does sound awesome :),29,6,23:56:17
Ben Fickes,Oh forgot my story so will tell it before I go to bed. I woke up early to run but it was raining. So I tried to go back to sleep but I couldnât. So I just used my running time to read the Bible and pray and it was amazing. Thatâs it haha,241,54,22:47:55
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs good! And no problem,32,6,20:43:18
Erica Yee,Thanks for asking,17,3,20:43:05
Erica Yee,And it was good,15,4,20:43:01
Erica Yee,Oh I had a decently long text conversation with her last night before I fell asleep,83,16,20:42:57
Ben Fickes,"Not to add another thing to your plate if you werenât planning to, Iâm just asking out of curiosity, are you talking with Leah tonight do you think?",152,28,20:39:47
Ben Fickes,I thought about that but didnât want to assume haha. And gotcha,65,12,20:39:00
Erica Yee,I downloaded it and hopefully will check it out later,53,10,20:38:20
Erica Yee,It's possible cuz she isn't working haha,40,7,20:38:03
Ben Fickes,HAHA are you getting it? Lemme know how it is if you do,55,13,20:37:23
Ben Fickes,Holy cow I have no idea how thatâs possible haha. Dw Iâm sure itâs good to wait,85,17,20:37:07
Erica Yee,Also I found out this was a thing today and want to try it omg,62,15,20:36:41
Erica Yee,Oh yeah not work stuff haha,27,6,20:36:09
Erica Yee,"Tiffany already (?!?!) made a vlog for our trip and she's like ""I left time for your footage"" but I haven't even looked at the tons of pics I took yet",150,31,20:35:50
Ben Fickes,Are you feeling okay about that? And not work stuff right?,58,11,20:35:47
Erica Yee,Pretty good. Have lots of stuff I want to catch up on tonight,61,13,20:35:14
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,20:33:17
Ben Fickes,"Thanks! My mom had to call my uncle so we had to postpone, but I talked to josh for a bit",89,21,20:33:11
Erica Yee,Have fun,8,2,19:13:05
Erica Yee,Nah I just stare at this app for so much of my waking hours,59,14,19:13:00
Ben Fickes,"I have a short story from this morning but Iâll share after dnd, Iâm gonna call my family now",97,19,19:08:18
Ben Fickes,And also incredibly perceptive haha,35,5,19:07:41
Ben Fickes,You are amazing Erica,21,4,19:07:23
Erica Yee,Ok sorry rant over lol,22,5,19:01:55
Erica Yee,I might be making this up but even the font size seems bigger..,63,13,19:01:51
Erica Yee,"At least say ""made minor visual tweaks"" or something!!",54,9,19:01:21
Erica Yee,Ok and they added a nice little transition when you change screens,66,12,19:01:00
Erica Yee,"Like the most recent messenger lite doesn't have release notes, but they clearly increased the padding on the top bar and the background color for the Android buttons",166,28,19:00:24
Erica Yee,I hate when devs don't provide info but I can clearly tell stuff they did,73,15,18:59:19
Erica Yee,You know me so well,19,5,18:58:49
Erica Yee,Lol omg really,14,3,18:58:47
Ben Fickes,I have access to our release notes doc but have never made changes to it,72,15,18:04:06
Ben Fickes,I love it haha. Thanks for sharing. Actually knew you read release notes and itâs one of several specifically Erica things haha (and I mean that positively),158,27,18:03:50
Erica Yee,I read release notes for my apps and sometimes they are just .. lol,67,14,17:54:16
Erica Yee,Haha indeed,11,2,16:56:34
Ben Fickes,"Well, nevertheless Iâm glad I can be the man of your dreams ð",66,13,16:27:50
Erica Yee,"Maybe for dream-ben, but I feel like the fact that it was the first question irl-ben asked speaks to your actually priorities",125,22,15:35:31
Ben Fickes,Dang what have you done to my priorities Erica,46,9,12:17:54
Erica Yee,Sad,3,1,12:06:25
Erica Yee,We didn't even order food at the time I remember,48,10,12:06:24
Erica Yee,You did not,11,3,12:06:10
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,12:06:06
Ben Fickes,And very glad youâre feeling well,35,6,12:04:32
Ben Fickes,Did I eat anything in your dream,32,7,12:04:22
Ben Fickes,Itâs actually because Iâve been waiting for you at a Japanese restaurant since I left California,100,16,12:04:12
Erica Yee,I dreamt that reunited in a Japanese restaurant (think cuz my family was discussing sashimi at dinner),102,17,11:05:09
Erica Yee,"Slept 11 hours, feeling much better",35,6,11:03:17
Ben Fickes,"Whenever you wake up, how are you doing?",40,8,8:03:39

Ben Fickes,Np :) goodnight and hope you sleep very well,44,9,22:37:04
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,22:32:05
Ben Fickes,"Ah I see. Well Iâm sure she knows you care. And yeah I will be, gonna brush in a minute. But wanted to check didnât need anything first",139,28,22:27:14
Erica Yee,Aren't you sleeping soon too,28,5,22:26:18
Erica Yee,"Not tonight, I can barely keep my eyes open, but thanks I appreciate",68,13,22:26:03
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well if you need to talk Iâm here. But I can let you have time with her since I am feeling alright identity wise right now haha,140,29,22:24:26
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah she's fine, nothing like that. Identity stuff",53,9,22:23:51
Ben Fickes,I think talking to her is being there for her,45,10,22:23:45
Erica Yee,So now I'm talking with her but I feel like I can't be fully engaged but I want to be there for her,99,23,22:23:11
Ben Fickes,I hope you like it! And oh my is she okay though? Like in any immediate trouble?,80,17,22:22:58
Erica Yee,Ahhh so I'm in bed and was gonna try to sleep but then Leah just messaged me something really important/vulnerable (I don't want to share exactly what yet before I understand the situation more),194,34,22:22:05
Erica Yee,I'm looking forward to it,25,5,22:20:41
Erica Yee,Aww thanks ð,15,3,22:20:34
Ben Fickes,Soooo I ordered you a birthday present but it will probably come early (delivery said 26th-29th I think). Anyways wanted to let you know so you can decide when to open it and know that itâs a birthday present haha,215,40,22:14:40
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha gotcha,16,3,20:48:00
Erica Yee,"Short term mission, sorry",25,4,20:47:51
Ben Fickes,OH your iiiiiiiiiiis helped me haha I know exactly what song,60,11,20:47:47
Erica Yee,No I'm guessing they don't even know what song,46,9,20:47:42
Erica Yee,"Then the chorus is like ""And iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii I'm desperate for you""",69,11,20:47:22
Erica Yee,This is the air I breathe,25,6,20:46:57
Ben Fickes,Also whatâs STM?,18,3,20:43:50
Ben Fickes,"Breathe as in the âbreathe, just breatheâ? And that is very interesting haha. Did they at least tell you what song?",119,21,20:43:44
Erica Yee,Also the youth group went to Guatemala for STM and they're sharing and apparently they want to perform a song... with us doing instrumental??? Like what lol. So many questions,175,30,20:42:46
Erica Yee,"Waymaker, who you say I am, my dad always wants to do breathe with 5 key changes",80,17,20:41:48
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! To both. What songs do you have in mind?,49,11,20:38:48
Erica Yee,I might try playing guitar cuz this church is so casual lmao,60,12,20:36:50
Erica Yee,Have a few in mind,18,5,20:36:32
Ben Fickes,Oh no you didnât! Do you have any ideas? And yikes but at least you get to go on Sunday,89,20,20:17:43
Erica Yee,Also I literally have not been to church for a month (June 23) yikes,68,14,20:10:09
Erica Yee,Need to decide what songs were doing lol,40,8,20:09:24
Erica Yee,Did I tell you I'm leading music with my dad at church ok Sunday,64,14,20:09:13
Erica Yee,"Not immediately, but early hopefully",36,5,20:08:51
Ben Fickes,Well the last thing is really good! Are you gonna sleep when you get home?,74,15,20:07:29
Erica Yee,"But I don't have a headache and didn't even drink coffee, so yay",64,13,20:06:56
Erica Yee,So not great lol,16,4,20:06:45
Erica Yee,I was almost falling asleep at my desk,38,8,20:06:42
Erica Yee,Haha,4,1,20:06:26
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling now,23,5,20:05:52

Ben Fickes,Oh and I forgot youâre productive in the bathroom ð,56,10,18:44:27
Ben Fickes,It will make you stronger,25,5,18:43:51
Erica Yee,Bruh you know I already do that to a probably excessive amount haha,67,13,18:33:38
Ben Fickes,And itâs good for you,23,5,18:25:32
Ben Fickes,My trick is drinking a lot of water so I get to take frequent bathroom and refill breaks,88,18,18:25:28
Ben Fickes,Oh noooooo. You can do it! Just two hours left,46,10,18:25:10
Erica Yee,I've been quite productive actually but losing steam now ð¬,61,10,18:12:17
Erica Yee,Wow that's dedication,21,3,14:12:33
Ben Fickes,My coworker said âI have a beetle-related name for every release.â I thought I misheard him but did not haha,112,20,13:26:59
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,13:16:35
Ben Fickes,"I feel great now haha. And Iâm very glad youâre alive, hope you get through the day ok",90,18,12:27:23
Erica Yee,I'm v tired lol but alive,25,6,12:25:30
Erica Yee,It was pretty hot yesterday so getting soaked by waterfall mist felt so good,76,14,12:25:22
Erica Yee,Ahh omg hope you feel better soon,33,7,12:24:47
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling,19,4,12:18:27
Ben Fickes,Apparently itâs supposed to rain though so maybe itâll cool down,68,11,12:18:23
Ben Fickes,"I felt pretty tired but have been pretty productive so far. It was so hot out, my run was really hard and I ate ice cream Shem bought as soon as I got back. Definitely tmi but I felt sorta nauseous on my run and when I got back I kept pooping for a solid ten minutes or so and was a little late to work",302,66,12:18:11
Erica Yee,How's your day going,20,4,12:16:23
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,12:16:21
Ben Fickes,Or Iâm getting good at implanting false memories into your mind,65,11,12:09:27
Erica Yee,I honestly can't remember but that could be right,49,9,12:08:13
Ben Fickes,And yeah I can picture that pretty clearly for victor,53,10,12:06:16
Ben Fickes,Oh I remember that too. Didnât one cancel though? Maybe Iâm misremembering,78,12,12:05:59
Erica Yee,I would've but I had two interviews I think,43,9,12:05:23
Erica Yee,Oh right xD,11,3,12:04:45
Erica Yee,And idk he says he's the worst brother ever for ditching but I also don't think he regrets it,93,19,12:04:32
Ben Fickes,I did not haha. In part because you suggested I didnât haha,61,12,12:04:24
Erica Yee,Did you go to work that next day? I can't remember,50,11,12:03:51
Ben Fickes,And yeah concerned indeed. Also though is victor okay?,54,9,12:02:20
Ben Fickes,I remember that! I think about that fairly frequently haha. Really hope work goes well for you,94,17,12:01:58
Erica Yee,(last two messages) appreciate the concern lol,46,7,11:40:41
Erica Yee,I'm getting flashbacks to when we stayed up talking really late I'm New York and then went to work the next day. Though that day was not as physically exhausting as yesterday haha,179,33,11:37:49
Erica Yee,Yup I'm on my way to work lol. This is going to be fun,54,14,11:37:05
Ben Fickes,Thanks for all the updates and cannot stress enough Iâm so glad youâre all safe. That is quite the adventure in and of itself haha,134,25,6:32:53
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Iâm so glad youâre safe and home and I hope youâre sleeping. Are you going to work today?,110,21,6:32:05
Erica Yee,Update: it's 2:30 and I'm finally home! That was quite an adventure,67,12,5:32:18
Erica Yee,"Omggg cute story. The tow truck driver's phone rang and it was his wife. She was driving home on the highway, saw a tow truck and wanted to know if it was him. It was! (And us haha)",181,38,1:22:52
Erica Yee,Update: we are getting towed to where Calvin's friends live and then trying to drive back once the brakes cool down,115,21,1:22:52
Erica Yee,It's 9pm here and I don't have signal so not sure when you'll get this lol but our brakes started smoking after going down a steep road so we're pulled over ð¬ ironically the song playing at the time was we didn't start the fire,230,45,1:22:52
Erica Yee,We had a really good group dynamic for being strangers though haha,66,12,1:22:50
Erica Yee,"Somewhat, they're cool but mainly I talked with Tiffany",55,9,1:22:50
Ben Fickes,Also weâre quizzing John on his clothing heâs wearing and he canât answer haha,84,14,22:13:33
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well hope you can sleep extra efficiently when you get back haha. And Iâm glad you enjoyed it! Did you get to talk Calvinâs friends much?,149,27,22:09:04
Erica Yee,Yay glad you liked it,21,5,22:07:31
Erica Yee,"Weekend was amazing! First trip I've been on just friends, and what an adventure lol",84,15,22:07:14
Erica Yee,We already used up Hamilton karaoke last night haha,51,9,22:06:42
Erica Yee,I don't want to sleep because I won't be able to sleep tonight and I'm shotgun and need to keep Calvin awake,108,22,22:06:35
Ben Fickes,"And just finished the boy and the beast. Very wholesome and does have a lot of fatherhood themes, I really liked it, thanks for the recommendation",146,26,22:01:35
Ben Fickes,Hopefully you can sleep (if you want to) on the ride. How are you feeling about the weekend as a whole?,103,21,22:01:10
Ben Fickes,It was good! Have not played in forever haha,44,9,22:00:43
Erica Yee,"Waterfall hike was epic, but still at Yosemite so not gonna get back till probably 11 at the earliest ahh",105,20,21:48:58
Erica Yee,How was it,10,3,21:48:22
Erica Yee,Oh yikes,8,2,21:48:21
Ben Fickes,I feel that haha. And no apparently her laptop is busted again haha,67,13,14:56:55
Erica Yee,Have fun gaming! Barbara couldn't make it?,42,7,14:35:54
Erica Yee,Yep we're trying to do the famous waterfall where you get wet and then heading back,83,16,14:35:40
Erica Yee,Really needed it,16,3,14:33:50
Erica Yee,Just had first full meal since Friday lunch lol,47,9,14:33:45

Ben Fickes,"Nice haha. Pretty good, about to play with josh and Fabricio",60,11,13:23:16
Erica Yee,How are you doing?,18,4,13:22:15
Erica Yee,Much better and slightly more rested bc I convinced everyone we should sleep in and take an easier day lol,106,20,13:14:12
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica :) how are you feeling today?,42,8,13:08:10
Erica Yee,"Congrats to you too, I'm so grateful for you in my life",55,12,13:07:23
Erica Yee,Omg how do you always remember I'm amazed #dismantlimgenderstereotypes,70,9,13:06:45
Erica Yee,Praying,7,1,13:06:20
Ben Fickes,Oh and Ariel used freedom units for Fahrenheit haha,51,9,8:17:06
Ben Fickes,"Also, thank you for/congrats on 6 months of dating! Will honestly probably send deeper feelings in a letter and Iâm rushing to church but I am incredibly grateful for you and the time we have gotten to spend and will get to spend together",240,44,7:54:19
Ben Fickes,Iâm so glad youâre feeling better! Will be praying for you. I did not sleep well last night (I are sugar before bed ugh) so I would appreciate prayers as well haha,167,32,7:53:12
Erica Yee,Update: we got food and I finally took medicine and my headache that I was denying existing went away and I showered so now I feel baptized,139,27,3:01:29
Erica Yee,Prayers for my body and head especially cuz losing so much sleep would be much appreciated pls,94,17,2:09:39
Erica Yee,But it was incredible and super fun day! Was wishing you were here and could see all the beautiful nature too,109,21,2:08:47
Erica Yee,"Ah thank you for all that. So sad I missed the picnic. can't reply to all your messages rn cuz I'm so exhausted, we did a very strenuous hike and haven't eaten for 11 hours since food is kinda hard to come by at night here",222,46,2:07:25
Erica Yee,Lol I think I just sent him a meme of using freedom units for miles or  fahrenheit (which one did he use it for?),113,24,2:04:36
Ben Fickes,"Anyways, goodnight and hope you had a good day! Idk why but seeing a lot of people today made me wish you were here more, canât wait to see you again :)",154,32,23:15:12
Ben Fickes,"Also also unrelated, my friend mike invited me to his beach house in cape cod sometime but honestly I donât know him that well so I donât really want to go. Just wanted to share haha",186,36,23:14:14
Ben Fickes,Going to bed but wanted to tell you I had a really good talk with Jason and Josh (separately haha) today. Also completely unrelated but Katie said she trusts your reviews of things in general because you put a lot of thought into them and I wanted to let you know she said that,277,54,23:13:21
Ben Fickes,"He didnât really explain he just mentioned, so Iâm curious to hear the story",80,14,23:10:59
Ben Fickes,Ariel just explained to me how you started him saying freedom units,67,12,19:47:01
Ben Fickes,Yeah I remember seeing all of Fabricios posts about it haha,59,11,18:44:38
Erica Yee,They won the champions league this year,39,7,18:03:09
Erica Yee,Nvmd I see it! So cool,22,6,18:02:55
Erica Yee,Not loading rn but I'll look later,34,7,18:01:57
Ben Fickes,Fabricio made this and showed it to me,38,8,14:06:07
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,9:44:44
Erica Yee,About an hour I think,21,5,9:29:09
Ben Fickes,And glad you slept well! How close are you to the park,54,12,9:16:32
Ben Fickes,"No itâs good haha, may you pee well",37,8,9:16:22
Erica Yee,I actually slept pretty well but others didn't,46,8,9:15:42
Erica Yee,there's only one bathroom in the house and it's been used until now and I need to pee so badly (sorry tmi),106,22,9:15:26
Erica Yee,Oh yeah we're trying to leave by 630 haha,41,9,9:14:47
Ben Fickes,"I see youâre up, everything okay?",35,6,9:13:53
Ben Fickes,Glad you made it safely! Hope youâre sleeping well and have a great time :),77,15,8:10:00
Erica Yee,House is super big and nice,27,6,2:36:28
Erica Yee,"""smile so my mom won't think we died""",37,8,2:36:24
Erica Yee,We're in!,9,2,2:27:19
Erica Yee,Night!,6,1,0:05:28
Ben Fickes,"Okay I should sleep now, goodnight and I hope you have an amazing time with your friends at Yosemite :)",103,20,0:03:20
Ben Fickes,Thanks but honestly itâs the grace of God. And HAHA I get that feeling because my letters to you were written while listening to music from my roommates and having vines being played on our tv,194,36,0:03:00
Erica Yee,You're welcome. It probably could be better but I'm also singing a long to book of Mormon lol,93,18,0:02:07
Erica Yee,I'm sure your prayers and support played a significant role,59,10,0:01:36
Ben Fickes,Both now and in general,23,5,0:00:56
Ben Fickes,"Oh and really thank you for the affirmation, I want to say that I notice it and it means a lot to me",100,23,0:00:50
Ben Fickes,And no problem! Ah if they can be friends I feel like I will personally feel a lot of peace haha,96,21,0:00:22
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much :) I really appreciate it,43,9,0:00:01
Erica Yee,Omg that's amazing!! Thank you for sharing that,47,8,23:59:28
Erica Yee,"I'm so grateful for you too, especially how you are willing to be flexible but also speak up when  make your wishes known when you want to",138,27,23:59:03
Ben Fickes,"I also wanted to share something really exciting, I talked with John and he talked with Vivian tonight and apparently things are good between them. And heâs gonna hang out with dan soon and Iâm so happy",206,37,23:54:58
Ben Fickes,And Iâm very very thankful for you,36,7,23:54:15
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs fine, I understand! Iâll be here when you can talk another time. I also am missing you a lot. Have been thinking a lot about our relationship recently and I actually get more amazed at who you are the more I think about it",233,45,23:53:41
Erica Yee,"Also just wanted to say that I'm missing you a lot. Sorry won't be able to call this weekend most likely, but hope you have a lot of fun with friends and get rest if you need it",177,38,23:50:51
Erica Yee,Inter-RA relationship,21,2,23:49:55
Ben Fickes,Oh because theyâre ras?,25,4,23:49:52
Ben Fickes,Allowed to date?,16,3,23:49:42
Erica Yee,"One friend we're going with (who I just met) her name is Hallie. Her sister is getting married next weekend. She and her fiance met as RAs in college. He called his mom and she called her sister, both saying they thought the other one was cute but they weren't sure if they were allowed to date",294,57,23:45:48
Erica Yee,Omg new story idea,18,4,23:43:32
Erica Yee,"We just picked up Calvin's friends so it's probably gonna be like 2 more hours, past when you sleep",99,19,23:40:06
Erica Yee,Yeah everyone grieves and it was all the feels,46,9,23:39:06
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs super sad. I assume thereâs stuff about how the surviving friend deals with it? And wow did not expect that actually,132,23,23:23:07
Erica Yee,She actually got pregnant...,28,4,23:21:27
Erica Yee,Also they did NOT adopt lol,27,6,23:21:23
Erica Yee,It felt really real,19,4,23:21:08
Erica Yee,"His best friend, who's engaged to her best friend, dies in a motorcycle accident....",84,14,23:20:53
Ben Fickes,Unless you wanna tell me on the phone,37,8,23:16:42
Ben Fickes,I just meant with how much he mentioned it about to all the boys haha. And glad you liked it! What was the plot twist,117,25,23:16:33
Erica Yee,And a really heartbreaking plot twist ugh,41,7,23:07:45
Erica Yee,Did I tell you I finished the friend zone? (The book I bought after listening to author on podcast) it was so good,114,23,23:07:26
Erica Yee,It's so cheesy but fun. Alternates perspectives which I haven't read in YA for a while,86,16,23:06:46
Erica Yee,Well I always observe it (yay minority culture instincts) but I only mention it if it's relevant haha,101,18,23:05:42
Ben Fickes,How do you like the book so far,31,8,23:05:08
Ben Fickes,Wow you sound like Jason making that observation haha,53,9,23:05:01
Erica Yee,Lol interestingly the girl is Chinese (obsessed with kdrama guys) and the boys are white,88,15,23:02:40
Ben Fickes,You can kiss me but no need to toss the ice cream haha,54,13,23:02:05
Erica Yee,Ok then I won't kiss you,24,6,23:00:35
Erica Yee,Yeah cuz he was so nice and cute before,39,9,23:00:22
Erica Yee,He's a hs senior..,18,4,23:00:13
Ben Fickes,If youâre ever mad at me and we get ice cream Iâm gonna be super defensive of my ice cream,94,20,22:58:52
Ben Fickes,That is actually the perfect thing to make a hatable love triangle person,73,13,22:58:17
Ben Fickes,Wow is he like twelve years old,31,7,22:57:30
Erica Yee,Omg he took her ice cream and threw it away so he could kiss her I actually don't like him now,94,21,22:41:49
Erica Yee,I want to dislike him but he's fine..just not the right guy for her,67,14,22:29:00
Erica Yee,(that's all),12,2,22:20:56
Erica Yee,I'm reading this YA book and the sorta love triangle guy's name is ben,70,14,22:20:08
Ben Fickes,Haha nice. I donât know anything about react,46,8,21:48:42
Erica Yee,I just move em around till things work lol,42,9,21:14:16
Erica Yee,"Yeah probably. There's still sorta big things about react that I don't understand, like even where's the optimal place to declare certain variables",147,23,21:13:49
Ben Fickes,Oh didnât know the deadline is next week. But you can do it! And I guess the plus is no one reading it has to see the code haha. Will you have time to clean it up do you think or not really?,192,43,21:11:18
Erica Yee,But it's hard to ask Evan when he's remote for these more conceptual questions,78,14,21:07:28
Erica Yee,The logic in my own project works but the code is sooo ugly,59,13,21:06:45
Erica Yee,Ugh there's 2 accidents on the way to pick up the other people for like an hour delay,85,18,21:06:04
Erica Yee,Slightly less stressed. We got a lot done and still a week before final deadline,80,15,21:05:44
Ben Fickes,How was work? Are you less stressed now haha,44,9,21:02:14
Ben Fickes,"Haha thanks, we can play another time then",42,8,21:01:59
Erica Yee,Game is just a little blurry but I'd do it for friendship haha,62,13,20:59:43
Erica Yee,I'd def play if I could but yeah not this time,46,11,20:57:32
Erica Yee,Oh yeah forgot about the picnic,31,6,20:57:15
Ben Fickes,"Hanging out with mike tonight, maybe call Jason. Tomorrow is Abby and Ariel, and sometime I might play ow with josh and Fabricio and maybe barbs. Guessing you wouldnât be able to play from Yosemite haha (and I think your computer canât handle it right?)",257,45,20:52:50
Erica Yee,Do you have any plans this weekend?,35,7,20:33:39
Erica Yee,Yep I will try,14,4,20:33:31
Erica Yee,I heard the year after I took it they made the curriculum a lot more difficult,78,16,20:33:21
Erica Yee,Oh dang good job,16,4,20:33:04
Ben Fickes,"If you have reception at Yosemite, can you let me know when you get there? If not no worries though",99,20,20:30:04
Ben Fickes,So I donât know roughly a third of that course,48,10,20:29:20
Ben Fickes,Eh basically got a 65 on the final and that was deemed good enough to skip haha,79,17,20:29:11
Erica Yee,Oh don't think so,17,4,20:02:56
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you about that?,26,6,18:55:30
Ben Fickes,Not really oops,15,3,18:55:25
Ben Fickes,I never took discrete (oops),28,5,18:55:20
Erica Yee,I don't even remember after discrete honestly,45,7,18:53:05
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,18:52:57
Ben Fickes,Will tell you more on the phone but yesterday my coworker and I taught our producer binary. And today she asked for a quiz,122,24,17:48:46
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well Iâm sure youâll do great! And in less than 3 hours itâs the weekend,86,16,17:47:57
Erica Yee,"It's ok though don't worry, just throwback to my writing internships where I was on deadline almost every day lol",113,20,17:38:01
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,17:37:33
Ben Fickes,"Dang Iâm really sorry, Iâm praying for you. And yeah itâs all on the server now versus trying to attach and parse extra info in the game after a save load",160,31,17:15:55
Erica Yee,Good thing both my coworker and I both didn't bring lunch cuz we really needed to just leave our desks lol,106,21,16:17:48
Erica Yee,Did you have a new strategy?,28,6,16:06:04
Erica Yee,Ohh lol,7,2,16:05:57
Erica Yee,Slightly less stressful but still on deadline for the rest of the day,69,13,16:05:50
Ben Fickes,My project is now much easier because Joe told me he thinks my old strategy was not possible/feasible hah,105,19,15:50:43
Ben Fickes,Dang Iâm sorry to hear that. Are things less stressful now? Glad the meeting went well,88,16,15:50:19
Erica Yee,But meeting went well (because editor in chief didn't end up calling in lol),76,14,15:19:39
Erica Yee,We had big show and tell meeting at 11am and there was stuff I had to implement before. Was rushing so much made dumb mistakes,126,25,15:19:23
Erica Yee,But today has been so stressful,31,6,15:18:37
Erica Yee,Hopefully haua,14,2,15:18:27
Ben Fickes,Did you get packed alright?,27,5,12:17:19
Erica Yee,Ooh yay,7,2,11:17:01
Ben Fickes,I got my new key. I saw the guy make it and it was really cool,62,16,8:35:05
Erica Yee,Aw ok,5,2,22:18:16
Ben Fickes,Iâm not talking with Jason tonight because he wants to talk when itâs not too late. But hopefully soon,106,19,21:48:36
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Safe travels, lemme know when you get to the park (if you have reception)",81,15,21:48:16
Erica Yee,Yeah going to where Calvin and Tiffany live directly from Bart,62,11,21:21:37
Ben Fickes,No worries! Take all the time you need :) and I forgot! Are you leaving for it tomorrow?,88,18,21:12:54
Erica Yee,Sorry I was gonna send you something but don't have time to get it ready yet,76,16,21:10:22
Erica Yee,I had a good day of work but now tired and there's stuff I need to do but also have to pack for Yosemite,104,24,21:10:10
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,21:09:35
Ben Fickes,Youâre like a pillsbury dough person and your attacks are just sticking your arms to other people,99,17,20:58:51
Erica Yee,Ooh like what,13,3,20:54:17
Ben Fickes,"Playing a game called gang beasts at work, itâs so funny because the physics are really janky",95,17,20:28:02
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. I do not work in the bathroom haha,45,10,20:27:39
Erica Yee,#alwaysproductive,17,1,20:15:45
Erica Yee,I was waiting in the bathroom and slacked someone about work and then she walked in lol,87,17,20:15:16
Erica Yee,Oh yeahh,8,2,17:59:45
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang. Thatâs when Ariel and Abby are visiting haha, weâre having a picnic",80,14,17:59:32
Erica Yee,Could be 105 degrees or higher ð®,35,7,17:56:24
Erica Yee,For this weekend,16,3,17:56:08
Erica Yee,Boston,6,1,17:54:03
Ben Fickes,Wait in Boston? Or in Oakland?,30,6,17:53:47
Erica Yee,Wowow flash flood warning yesterday and then heat emergency today,65,10,17:50:08
Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬,8,1,17:49:52
Ben Fickes,I asked Owen for help. And then I asked him to explain/define a decent amount of terms he used to help me which is how I know Iâm in trouble haha,147,31,16:30:02
Erica Yee,"And oh man, can you get help?",29,7,15:58:44
Erica Yee,"Oh maybe, don't remember",24,4,15:57:42
Ben Fickes,Also I am realizing Iâm completely out of my league on this project,69,13,15:43:38
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm if this is what I think it is, either you or Ariel sent me an article about it roughly a year ago haha",107,24,15:05:00
Erica Yee,Heard of it?,12,3,14:10:47
Erica Yee,My dad sent ^,13,4,14:10:45
Erica Yee,A friend of mine is at this: https://www.facebook.com/ChristianGDC/,67,8,14:10:33
Ben Fickes,Yep,3,1,12:16:07
Erica Yee,Is he back in Philly?,21,5,12:14:37
Ben Fickes,Forget if I already told you this but Iâm going to call Jason tonight,71,14,12:14:09
Ben Fickes,Gotcha gotcha,13,2,12:13:44
Erica Yee,No it was water pipes leaked,28,6,12:09:45
Ben Fickes,Has it been raining there?,26,5,12:09:30
Ben Fickes,Daaaang,7,1,12:09:19
Erica Yee,But I think it was pipes lol,28,7,12:09:18
Erica Yee,Flooding also delayed me,24,4,12:09:07
Ben Fickes,I also couldnât get on my first train haha. And was gonna say that riding t for first time since CA reminded me of us on Bart for some reason,143,30,12:08:02
Erica Yee,"Bart was delayed and I couldn't get on the first train cuz it was too full, so same haha",88,19,12:06:27
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,12:03:48
Ben Fickes,"It took me longer today, was a little late",42,9,12:02:16
Erica Yee,Does it take longer or shorter on the t,39,9,11:09:44
Erica Yee,And wow they are so extra,25,6,11:05:14
Erica Yee,Omggg sad,9,2,11:04:51
Ben Fickes,"Taking the t to work (really bad rain), first time I havenât walked",69,13,8:30:25
Ben Fickes,Oh and seeing your snap - Dan told me Conor washed Abbyâs feet when he proposed to her. Which seems very him haha,115,23,8:10:30
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs it, thank you for accompanying me on this wild ride of a story",71,14,8:08:24
Ben Fickes,So I woke up and was debating whether or not to run or sleep in. I decided to run and got all ready. Then I realized that as soon as I step outside I have no way back in. So I went back to bed,192,45,8:08:11
Ben Fickes,"Thanks haha, me too (to both)",29,6,23:13:09
Erica Yee,And that you get enough rest tonight haha,41,8,23:09:23
Erica Yee,Hope you get a working one soon,31,7,23:09:04
Ben Fickes,I assume so,11,3,23:08:25
Erica Yee,Was it because of the people sleeping there,43,8,23:08:10
Erica Yee,Oh wow,6,2,23:08:02
Ben Fickes,They installed a second door (so itâs like your apartment now with two doors). Mine works on the inner door but not outer. All my roommates work on both,154,29,23:07:36
Erica Yee,What's up with your key,23,5,23:06:58
Erica Yee,And glad to hear it,19,5,23:06:54
Erica Yee,Aw yay dan,10,3,23:06:51

Ben Fickes,And Vanessaâs character came back as a ghost sorta,52,9,22:48:07
Ben Fickes,Josh just ran away,18,4,22:47:52
Ben Fickes,We fought dark elves basically,30,5,22:47:45
Ben Fickes,I can tell he really likes it,29,7,22:47:37
Ben Fickes,It was good! We had a very tough fight and dan almost died haha,63,14,22:47:31
Erica Yee,"Just got to the gym, first time in a very long time lol",55,13,22:37:28
Erica Yee,"Oh wow, how was it (if you have time)",37,9,22:35:11
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,22:34:55
Ben Fickes,And Vanessa called in for this one!,35,7,22:31:50
Ben Fickes,"Dnd went really late, weâre still in Ryder haha",49,9,22:31:41
Ben Fickes,Okay will add all of those to my list,37,9,22:31:32
Erica Yee,Also Ss and oatmeal,19,4,22:05:01
Erica Yee,Remind to tell you about this author interview podcast I'm listening to please,78,13,20:41:02
Erica Yee,ð¤£ good q,11,3,19:31:09
Ben Fickes,Apparently his first question when making his character was âis there Jesus in dndâ,87,14,19:26:38
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha,9,2,19:25:59
Erica Yee,Oh man this sounds like it's going to he fun x),47,11,19:11:21
Ben Fickes,"Devotion is stuff like âbe honest, and donât kill if you donât have to.â Vengeance is like âleave no sin unpunishedâ",128,21,19:07:37
Ben Fickes,"Yeah, paladins have to swear an oath when they reach level 3. And then they have to obey the tenets of that oath",112,23,19:07:10
Erica Yee,Are the oaths a thing in all dnd?,33,8,19:05:32
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,19:05:16
Ben Fickes,Dan is also a paladin. He wanted to have oath of devotion but I have that so he took OATH OF VENGEANCE which I think is hilarious,129,27,18:56:09
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,18:46:09
Ben Fickes,Gonna head over as soon as I eat so I can help dan,50,13,18:23:20
Ben Fickes,Yep,3,1,18:23:11
Erica Yee,Dnd is in Ryder?,16,4,18:22:27
Erica Yee,Aw man,6,2,18:22:23
Ben Fickes,"Think thereâs still dnd later, and Iâm not looking forward to going outside. But oh well",92,16,18:15:33
Ben Fickes,"Walked home through the rain, it wasnât great haha. But Iâm back now",72,13,18:15:17
Ben Fickes,That is tricky. Not that I know a ton about design but I guess that you probably know most of what theyâd teach in the coding one,131,27,18:15:03
Erica Yee,Think I'm gonna email my Prof from last semester and ask what I should do. Since there's also intro to programming for design classes but I already know how to code,164,31,17:39:39
Erica Yee,I want to do interaction design 1: responsive but the time is horrible,70,13,17:38:33
Ben Fickes,And I love the number of dots haha,34,8,17:32:17
Ben Fickes,Oh what classes are you looking at? Lemme know what you do,58,12,17:32:17
Ben Fickes,Thanks! Heading home for work now. Iâll try not to engage with any floods I see,81,16,17:31:28
Erica Yee,"Flash flood warning in Boston, stay safe",40,7,17:06:15
Erica Yee,But the ones I would take are 6-930pm........ (And one is on Tuesday........),77,13,16:30:09
Erica Yee,Thinking about switching my politics elective class to a graphic design one,75,12,16:28:54
Erica Yee,LOL omg,7,2,12:30:22
Ben Fickes,I will! RenÃ©e told me âitâs surprising but also notâ,59,10,12:21:47
Erica Yee,Ooh tell me about his character please,38,7,12:19:57
Ben Fickes,Gonna help him choose spells after work,39,7,12:11:10
Ben Fickes,Dans joining dnd tonight,24,4,12:11:00
Erica Yee,Yay haha,8,2,12:09:29
Ben Fickes,Oh no haha. Glad you made it. I was running late because I thought Thiago was in the shower but he wasnât even in the bathroom haha. But I also made it,153,32,12:08:51
Erica Yee,You?,4,1,12:07:47
Erica Yee,But made it essentially on time,31,6,12:07:45
Erica Yee,I woke up 17 mins before we are supposed to leave and had to shower still lol,77,17,12:07:39
Erica Yee,It really depends what you're building for,42,7,12:07:14
Ben Fickes,Howâs your day going?,23,4,12:02:43
Ben Fickes,"No problem! And okeydokey, thanks. Told Owen and he said âInteresting. One day Iâll figure that stuff out.â",113,18,12:02:37
Erica Yee,It's both. Essentially node for backend and react for frontend,62,10,11:25:11
Erica Yee,"Omg thank you for asking Matt, really appreciate it",51,9,11:24:00
Ben Fickes,Like was it react or node? Canât exactly remember sorry,57,10,9:18:03
Ben Fickes,My coworkers want to know what you use for your web development haha,68,13,9:17:46
Ben Fickes,"Also also, last night I asked Matt if heâd be willing to drive you (and me, if you want me to help) to pick up your stuff and he said yes (without hesitation haha)",165,34,6:56:27
Ben Fickes,"Also, saw your music email reply - thank you! Iâll take a look later",70,14,6:34:13
Ben Fickes,Haha holy cow you are parallel. Glad it was good and glad you could meet up!,76,16,6:33:36
Erica Yee,Lol we're so parallel,21,4,0:13:15
Erica Yee,"She just finished freshman year at UCSB, where Calvin went",58,10,22:41:53
Erica Yee,Dinner was really good! She talks a ton which is fun,52,11,22:41:36

Erica Yee,Hahaha omg,10,2,22:40:20
Ben Fickes,Here are pics of me trying on some of Johns glasses. Ignore the unshavenness haha,81,15,22:03:49
Ben Fickes,How was dinner?,15,3,22:01:50
Ben Fickes,Yeah. We did talk yesterday but I told him I wanted to talk about something and it would make me feel better if he at least replied. Oh well though,147,30,22:01:46
Erica Yee,Hopefully you guys can talk soon,32,6,21:58:24
Erica Yee,Aww that is annoying,20,4,21:58:18
Ben Fickes,So a little annoyed at that but oh well,39,9,20:54:15
Ben Fickes,"Mine was pretty good, a little slow. I asked Jason to talk again because I wanted to talk to him about something from yesterday. And now heâs not replying to my messages ofc",175,33,20:53:59
Ben Fickes,Hope the dinner is good!,24,5,20:53:06
Ben Fickes,The homeless project? Can definitely see how thatâs scary but thatâs gonna be so cool when itâs done. You got this ðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðªðª,201,22,20:52:51

Erica Yee,Having dinner with my mom and newfound bio cousin who we never met before because she's been at college (but her family is the one who lives in SF),147,29,20:07:12
Erica Yee,My day was ok. I basically own the project for the thing I mocked up now which is kinda scary,93,20,20:06:25
Ben Fickes,How was your day? Have dnd so I may not reply for a bit,55,14,20:00:03
Ben Fickes,I know I was surprised to hear it. Shem said Conor pretended to be in New Mexico and sent old pics of him there haha. And apparently he proposed Saturday but I didnât find out Sunday even though I saw them at alethia,218,43,19:59:14
Erica Yee,Omg yay!! They gonna be apart for so long tho ð­,50,11,19:47:34
Erica Yee,"And dw, I probs send you more on the regular hen you're sleeping haha",69,14,19:47:16
Erica Yee,Lool you got this ðª (suggested emoji for some reason),56,10,19:46:53
Erica Yee,Got IT to reset it. And thankfully I could do most coding stuff without the docs,80,16,19:46:34
Ben Fickes,Conor and Abby are engaged!,27,5,19:23:06
Ben Fickes,Sorry for all the texts but also update from my mom haha,56,12,18:31:46
Ben Fickes,"I told Joe (basically our best engineer) about my project because I was asking for help and he said âNathan [my manager], you canât get out of this that easily!â
Nathan: âI thought it would be a good growing opportunity for Benâ
Joe: âyeah, itâll be great for Ben. Has Owen not talked to you about how dangerous this is?â
So hopefully all goes well haha",369,66,17:49:59
Ben Fickes,Oh nice haha. How did you get in? And what did you do for the two hours,71,17,17:46:23
Erica Yee,Update: twas a long 2 hours but I'm back in haha,48,11,17:22:41
Erica Yee,"The password I type in for computer and outlook email is engrained in my head but not the one for Google drive, so got locked out today rip lol",143,29,15:38:10
Erica Yee,I forgot my work Google account password which I for once did not write down anywhere and now my workflow is paralyzed,118,22,15:37:31
Erica Yee,ð¤£,4,1,12:10:01
Ben Fickes,HAHA I love it. Can picture the scene in my head (minus what your coworkers look like),86,17,12:03:25
Erica Yee,"Just got roasted so hard. Everyday I look at a newspaper stack and flip one over to see what the page 1 stories so I can read them online. But today two of my co-workers were behind me when I did that and they were like ""Erica doesn't know what this paper thing is"" LOL",269,55,12:00:24
Erica Yee,Yeah you collect people's stories and then share them with others at campfires or something,91,15,11:31:08
Ben Fickes,And HAHA whoop indeed,21,4,11:26:42
Ben Fickes,"Oh I like those games, and I think itâd be especially enjoyable to play together",82,15,11:26:31
Erica Yee,Whoop,5,1,11:02:02
Erica Yee,"Yay thanks. No need for you to get it, I think it'd be more fun to make decisions together (looks like just click through narrative gameplay)",141,26,10:48:39
Erica Yee,Omg I see it,12,4,10:46:58
Ben Fickes,"And I would love to play it with you, thank you so much ð is it something we can play remotely if I get it? Or do you want to wait until weâre in the same place?",166,37,6:34:45
Ben Fickes,Oh in the last pic if you zoom in on the table you can see where I spilled my beer haha,87,21,6:33:48
Erica Yee,just bought this game cuz i read an article about how it added new content about chinese americans in history and i'm about that. not my usual kind of game (more yours cuz it's about stories lol) but would love to try it with you sometime https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/03/12/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine-is-a-giant-leap-forward-for-video-game-storytelling/?utm_term=.d92afff3b174,409,47,1:07:54

Me: .........you know I'm working right",166,31,22:43:07
Erica Yee,Wowowow Matt's wedding ring,27,4,22:33:41

Ben Fickes,How was rest of work,20,5,20:36:31
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,20:29:51
Ben Fickes,"Okay so just talked with Jason. Heâs doing really well, he told me all about him and Rachel in Indiana, it sounds like they had a great time. I talked a lot about us and he asked some about our relationship, Iâll tell you more when we call next",248,49,20:27:22
Erica Yee,Omg don't remind me,19,4,19:24:38
Ben Fickes,While I wait for Jason to eat Iâm doing my learning outcomes. Ugh theyâre very silly at this point in the co op haha,120,24,19:01:49
Erica Yee,HAHA I'm sure I did but don't even remember the reflex,54,11,18:58:31
Ben Fickes,And sure thing :),17,4,18:39:47
Ben Fickes,And because you told me about your quirk Iâm imagining you sticking out your tongue at your phone,99,18,18:39:42
Ben Fickes,I love laughing at my own jokes,31,7,18:39:18
Erica Yee,Ooh nice. Lemme know how he's doing,35,7,18:15:33

Ben Fickes,Oh my ggggggoodness (haha) that is a shame. But thatâs cool you found out at least,84,16,18:01:36
Erica Yee,Finally asked one of the other devs and he somehow figured that out. Whoops kinda wasted my morning but now we know lol,119,23,15:45:53
Erica Yee,"Omgggg it wasn't my fault, it's Chrome's mobile preview that is sorta busted",76,13,15:45:24
Erica Yee,I'm very stuck on an annoying css issue,39,8,15:06:23
Erica Yee,Yay good job,12,3,15:06:07
Ben Fickes,"Pretty good! Got solid progress (well more like some progress, but Iâm glad for anything haha) on my big project",114,20,12:45:31
Erica Yee,How's your day going,20,4,12:40:03
Erica Yee,That's the goal,15,3,12:40:00

Erica Yee,Aw thanks for your CUTE pics,28,6,11:20:05
Erica Yee,He did a piano/singing medley of his old songs that was cool. And then anytime he sang in falsetto my heart melted LOL,118,23,11:19:51
Ben Fickes,Here are some of us,19,5,7:56:16
Ben Fickes,Oh one thing I forgot to say last night - thanks for the pics you sent! I loved seeing your facial expressions haha. And I showed them to my family and it made them smile,170,35,7:55:51
Ben Fickes,Nice! What was your favorite song,33,6,6:31:56
Erica Yee,Concert was incredible no regrets,33,5,1:32:17

Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! And glad sheâs feeling better,48,8,19:52:46
Erica Yee,Are you free to talk a bit in like 45 mins? Going home briefly before concert,77,16,19:52:06
Erica Yee,Thanks. She got food and mood swung back somewhat,49,9,19:50:37
Ben Fickes,Yeah I will pray right now. Hopefully by then itâs all better,63,12,18:24:24
Erica Yee,Ugh can you pray for me please. Julia and I got annoyed at each other while driving and I said sorry but I don't think she really accepted it and I'm too exhausted to be emotionally on during the concert but I want it to be fun,227,47,18:21:39
Erica Yee,It's like shipping but what people who watch anime say,54,10,18:17:16
Ben Fickes,Nah I trust the completeness of your definition,47,8,17:52:17
Erica Yee,LOL you gotta use urban dictionary or something,47,8,17:51:34
Ben Fickes,"Or thatâs what it looks like, didnât click on it because of the sketchy name haha",85,16,17:48:24
Ben Fickes,So even though you told me what it means I looked it up to see if there was anything I missed and found a website literally called âwhatdoesotpmeanâ .com. But it says âon the phoneâ haha,194,36,17:48:06
Ben Fickes,Ahh I see. Well Iâm very honored haha,39,8,17:42:15
Erica Yee,It's a fandom thing,19,4,17:41:58
Erica Yee,One true pairing,16,3,17:41:35

Ben Fickes,âOld Testament Partnersâ,28,3,17:32:40
Ben Fickes,What is OTP,11,3,17:32:14
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Sorry was explaining the plot of dear Evan Hansen to John haha,71,14,17:32:09
Erica Yee,Lmao Sophie just called us her OTP,34,7,17:06:35

Ben Fickes,How far into your drive are you?,32,7,17:05:13
Ben Fickes,Haha I guess so,15,4,17:05:05
Erica Yee,So guess this is my sign,24,6,17:04:52
Erica Yee,I actually mentioned her to my mom last night and said I should reach out to her,80,17,17:04:48
Erica Yee,I will,6,2,17:04:20
Ben Fickes,"Yep, weâre all meeting up on Saturday. And yeah, I can talk to her on Saturday but Iâm sure since she knows you better sheâd appreciate a message",151,28,16:56:28
Erica Yee,Oh man I should reach out to Abby and see how she's doing,57,13,16:55:57
Erica Yee,Oh really?! Yay,15,3,16:55:45
Ben Fickes,Oh did I not tell you? He and Abby are coming next weekend,58,13,16:54:39
Erica Yee,Sad I can't see him,19,5,16:54:25
Erica Yee,I think he's trying to visit Boston on August sometime actually,63,11,16:54:16
Erica Yee,Fun times,9,2,16:54:01
Ben Fickes,He also really wanted to âconvertâ Christians from other churches to ccfc haha,82,13,16:51:49
Erica Yee,Oh yeah haha. He always wants to make things competitive,56,10,16:50:53
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,16:50:17
Ben Fickes,Convert me to alethia? You sound like Ariel haha,48,9,16:48:43
Erica Yee,Lol jk,6,2,16:46:29
Erica Yee,Sophie's welcome wagon is part of my master plan to convert you,63,12,16:46:24
Ben Fickes,I like that system haha,23,5,16:45:56
Erica Yee,Oh nice,7,2,16:44:38
Erica Yee,Yeah. I don't even know what it's called and I kinda doubt we're ever gonna finish it lol. Julia's driving now so listening to kpop now,135,26,16:44:20
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs right! During the school year right? And what book is it? And dang well Iâm glad sheâs curious and asking questions. Sat next to her at church haha,163,30,16:34:30
Erica Yee,Then Sophie started texting me all these hard faith questions (like about the unforgivable sin..) so trying to answer those,123,20,16:17:34
Erica Yee,Day's just been driving. During my mom and my turns we started listening to a YA book that's cheesy but enjoyable haha,118,22,16:17:00
Erica Yee,Lol I need to update my resume. Especially since I'm thinking of applying to do web stuff for the Huntington news next year,123,23,16:15:52
Erica Yee,Oh nice! Glad it was a good visit,33,8,16:15:23
Ben Fickes,Howâs your day been?,22,4,16:09:49
Ben Fickes,Iâm trying to be mildly productive by working on my resume a little bit and sending a few emails. But thatâs it haha,120,23,16:09:45
Ben Fickes,"Alethia was really good! Sermon was on turning to substances for control and escape. After church Josh and I walked and talked for two hours which was really good. Then we played a little bit of video games, got lunch, and they left",232,43,16:09:20
Erica Yee,How was aletheia? And the rest of your day,42,9,15:54:47
Erica Yee,Thanks sam,10,2,15:54:37
Erica Yee,Lol I knew this would happen since I posted on my ig,52,12,15:54:09
Ben Fickes,"Okay hereâs the convo:
Sam: âare you dating someone?â
Me: *smiles* âuh yeahâ
Sam: âis it...â
Me: âyeah Iâm dating Ericaâ
Sam: âokay I saw pictures and thought you two were probably together. Thatâs really goodâ",236,36,14:53:57
Ben Fickes,"And Iâm glad you and your mom got to whisper talk so much haha! Sorry for the late reply, was hanging out with family. Theyâre leaving very soon, Iâll text you the Sam convo when they leave (but itâs not that hype worthy haha)",234,44,14:43:36
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much for the pic haha,34,8,14:42:26
Erica Yee,"My mom and I shared a bed and since we napped in the afternoon, we couldn't sleep. So after probably an hour or so we whispered for what felt like at least 2 more hours about life and relationships and feelings. It was really good but don't want to think about how much more sleep I lost lol",291,58,11:56:58
Erica Yee,"And the only correct response to that is ""With God, Sam. It's a relationship not a religion""",92,17,11:54:02
Erica Yee,LOL that sounds ambitious of me,31,6,11:53:05
Erica Yee,Yes the one I sent the snap of,30,8,11:52:49
Ben Fickes,Sam just asked me âare you in a relationship?â Will tell you full convo later haha,86,16,9:27:02
Ben Fickes,"Oh also I had a dream you were in last night. You were on a balcony and I was walking and we were shouting trying to communicate where we were going to church, and you were saying youâd bike to CCFC (âthereâs no service today!!!â I shouted up in the dream) and I was saying Iâd walk to alethia. Anyways thatâs all I can remember haha",345,66,8:29:23
Ben Fickes,Is that the one you sent the snap of?,37,9,8:06:02
Ben Fickes,HAHA I love the expression,26,5,8:05:06
Erica Yee,Me eating the chocolate siulongbao,34,5,0:45:37
Erica Yee,You gotta have friends with cars,32,6,0:10:35
Ben Fickes,"Jk, heâd like it but I understand not wanting to go out",57,12,23:30:55
Ben Fickes,See Josh should try stuff like this when heâs at college,58,11,23:30:38
Ben Fickes,Whoahhhh thatâs so crazy. Glad you got to see them,52,10,23:30:27
Erica Yee,But all the Asians in LA are here haha,38,9,23:29:40

Ben Fickes,Same ones you saw earlier?,26,5,23:27:26
Ben Fickes,HAHA wow LA isnât even a small place,38,8,23:27:20
Erica Yee,We ran into our relatives at this night market LOL,50,10,23:22:58
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad!,13,3,23:22:50
Ben Fickes,And the song is not waving through a window haha,48,10,22:53:47
Ben Fickes,Remind me to tell you about it sometime,39,8,22:53:36
Ben Fickes,But thereâs a song the show reminds me of,43,9,22:53:29
Ben Fickes,Have more thoughts but not really anything I can verbalize now,62,11,22:53:22
Ben Fickes,"Just finished the show, it was really good",42,8,22:53:03

Erica Yee,Also like for forever,21,4,20:07:27
Ben Fickes,Have also read the plot on Wikipedia haha. Canât remember (or maybe havenât listened to) you will be found,110,19,19:30:28
Erica Yee,Lol I think liking waving through a window is less basic (and a better song) than you will be found,99,20,19:29:48
Erica Yee,No but I've listened through the soundtrack and read the plot on Wikipedia,74,13,19:29:11
Ben Fickes,"Have you seen it? I like requiem and really like waving through a window (which josh tells me is basic haha). Have actually not listened to all the songs, just some of them",172,33,19:27:50
Erica Yee,I like a lot of the songs but especially requiem and only us,60,13,19:26:05

Ben Fickes,Have you done anything today? Besides land and nap haha,55,10,18:56:45
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,18:53:28
Ben Fickes,Which actually reminds me of a story from New York Iâll tell you later,72,14,18:50:59
Ben Fickes,Have never been before. Itâs an Italian place,47,8,18:50:46

Erica Yee,Aww haha,8,2,18:48:38
Erica Yee,I do but still getting we caffeine cuz it's going to be a long night,68,15,18:48:36
Ben Fickes,Weâre at dinner and my mom said âyou could take Erica here for a nice date!â Later she said âitâs a little loud. May not be the best for date night conversation.â So guess she is always on the lookout for places haha,228,43,18:43:15
Ben Fickes,Weâre about to go to the surprise,35,7,18:42:28
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Do you feel less tired?,34,7,18:42:15

Erica Yee,Nope we're all good,19,4,10:44:03
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I can imagine that haha. But she didnât change flights right?,73,13,10:38:29
Erica Yee,We were at the airport kiosk and Julia accidentally pressed the button to change flights instead of get boarding passes and I yelled NO really loudly and everyone looked at us,175,31,10:34:10
Erica Yee,Np lol,6,2,10:33:13
Ben Fickes,Thanks for not being jealous of my thank you note to your family ð,69,14,10:16:04
Ben Fickes,Haha actually though,20,3,10:15:33
Erica Yee,This is why we're good at codenames together haha,49,9,10:11:21
Erica Yee,Omg I totally meant it as former,32,7,10:10:45
Ben Fickes,Quick funny story - I showed my family your snap of the card (the one that said âwhy does Ben have more to say to my family than meâ). I interpreted it as âwhy does Ben have more to say to my family than I do.â But my mom and josh interpreted it as âwhy does Ben have more to say to my family than he does to me.â So (assuming you meant the former) I thought that was funny. But if you meant the latter then sorry haha,430,89,10:02:26
Erica Yee,ð®ð®,8,1,9:42:23
Ben Fickes,My only hint is that my mom is asking me to wear a button down,62,15,9:25:36
Ben Fickes,I will haha,11,3,9:25:25
Erica Yee,Lemme know what it is haha,26,6,9:23:36
Erica Yee,Oooh cool cool,14,3,9:23:30

Ben Fickes,And then my mom has âa surpriseâ for Josh and I tonight that she wonât reveal to us,89,18,9:22:08
Ben Fickes,"Seeing Spider-Man with Josh, Beth, and Rachel",45,7,9:21:50
Ben Fickes,"Was going to try to make a joke about not worrying, like sparrows, but have no idea how to pull it together haha",112,23,9:21:36
Erica Yee,What are you doing today?,25,5,9:18:20
Erica Yee,In bringing the sparrow but there's only like a 20% chance I'll read it lol,75,15,9:18:15

Erica Yee,Ooh I will,10,3,23:05:25
Ben Fickes,Unrelated but I summoned a guild boss in SEGA heroes. We can work together to fight it. You donât have to ofc but I would recommend fighting it once in the next 24 hours in order to get rewards (itâs in the guild tab),221,44,22:57:53
Ben Fickes,We left,7,2,22:57:08
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice! Iâm glad. And yep, she just didnât come to the board game night",76,15,22:57:06

Erica Yee,Omg this text from my mom,25,6,20:11:18
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! You told me about the homelessness project (or at least that you were on it),85,17,18:29:43
Erica Yee,But it's for part of the big homelessness project,49,9,18:23:50
Erica Yee,Oh idk if I told you,20,6,18:23:41

Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs the rotation program right?,39,6,17:03:16
Erica Yee,Oh just found out one of the new hires is a year long fellow,60,14,15:34:11
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,15:23:14
Ben Fickes,"Will tell you more when we talk, thereâs slightly more story",62,11,14:57:36
Ben Fickes,Tool for non programmers to edit saved,38,7,14:57:23
Erica Yee,"What is it, if you can say",26,7,14:41:44
Erica Yee,Oh dangg,8,2,14:41:35
Ben Fickes,I just got a âmajor projectâ for my last five weeks. It feels like a final boss or test of my internship haha,113,23,14:18:01
Ben Fickes,"Both are on MPQ. Ones a designer, the other is analytics",56,11,14:17:25
Erica Yee,What are their roles,20,4,13:54:26
Erica Yee,Oh no you didn't,16,4,13:54:23
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you we got two new people this week?,47,11,13:47:29
Ben Fickes,Oh nice (to both haha),22,5,13:47:17
Erica Yee,They hired 2 new people!!! Who start my last week lol,53,11,13:22:03
Erica Yee,We're hoping to have a jam sesh but we'll see hehe,50,11,13:14:44
Ben Fickes,Lemme know if you play any games haha,37,8,13:04:07
Ben Fickes,Oh have fun! And a safe flight tomorrow,39,8,13:03:49
Erica Yee,"Thanks :) and nah my friends might come over tonight, then Julia and I are flying down in the morning",101,20,12:29:34
Ben Fickes,"Yeah. Sorry that happened. But itâll be fine, Iâm sure. And itâs Friday! Are you going to LA right after work?",116,21,12:25:29
Erica Yee,So that helped,14,3,12:12:35
Erica Yee,"But it's ok. Had a good morning Devo that included Proverbs 4:25 ""Look straight ahead, and fix your eyes on what lies before you.""",130,24,12:12:31
Erica Yee,Whole*,6,1,12:11:48
Erica Yee,"Started out badly because when I drove myself to Chinatown (my parents are driving to LA rn), I took the wrong parking card and now I have to pay for a while day of lot parking...",179,36,12:11:10
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,12:05:44
Erica Yee,I'm shook lol,13,3,10:53:06
Ben Fickes,"I heard people talking about it but I donât know what the scene is. Might be watching it tomorrow, weâll see since I havenât gotten tickets yet",149,27,6:35:56
Erica Yee,The credits scenes though omgggg,32,5,1:09:38
Erica Yee,I liked the movie. Tom Holland is fun. And the effects and the shots were really dynamic,88,17,0:53:56
Erica Yee,Yeah I heard about that. But it's still hard to grasp how she could say things when he was so vulnerable,104,21,0:52:54
Ben Fickes,"Anyways a lot more to it, maybe we can talk over phone sometime or if not thatâs okay. Donât think I agree with him fully but I understand what heâs saying",161,31,22:59:07
Ben Fickes,Shems viewpoint is that her POV is skewed such that she actually believed she was helping him,93,17,22:58:34
Ben Fickes,So she also had very bad depression and more stuff,50,10,22:56:41
Ben Fickes,We just had a long talk,23,6,22:56:24
Ben Fickes,I know,6,2,22:56:19
Erica Yee,Whaa she said such bad stuff,28,6,22:10:55
Ben Fickes,And Marcus and Joycelyn came over halfway through haha,54,9,21:58:57
Ben Fickes,Documentary was good but it was part 1 of 2. Have not gotten to talk with my roommates a ton about it but Shem mentioned beforehand that he thought âmost people in her position would have done the same thingâ which I disagree with,234,44,21:57:07
Ben Fickes,(In reaction to you âmmmâ even though I know thatâs not what you meant),77,14,21:55:52
Erica Yee,Mmmm,4,1,21:22:13
Ben Fickes,"People at Pivotal got offers after co op so you might! And gotcha, yeah I guess the coding is very different from the writing",125,24,21:12:51
Erica Yee,"Also, attended an intern/new hire training on different aspects of reporting and ethics which was cool. But also can't really imagine going back to only writing now",164,27,21:04:24
Erica Yee,Lol thanks. It's so far in the future so I kinda doubt it but I think they'll at least mention the possibility,110,22,21:02:57
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Okay saying this in a text seems to emphasize how biased it is since I havenât seen you work (but I have seen your work!) but I would be shocked if they didnât give you a return offer,196,40,20:48:57
Erica Yee,Lol but good sign I think,25,6,20:47:32
Erica Yee,"Oh also apparently my big boss jokingly asked the other producers (who told me) ""what if Erica doesn't go back to school?""",122,22,20:47:26
Erica Yee,I'll try not to spoil it ð,29,7,20:43:11
Ben Fickes,Lemme know how Spider-Man is please,35,6,20:40:30
Ben Fickes,Will let you know how it is,27,7,20:40:20
Ben Fickes,Yeah I actually heard a little bit about it (which is rare for me haha),71,15,20:40:13
Erica Yee,No but her sentencing happened when I worked at Boston.com so I'm familiar with the case,88,16,20:38:03
Ben Fickes,Have you seen it?,17,4,20:37:37
Erica Yee,ð¢ Get ready for lots of on-screen texts,42,8,20:37:19
Ben Fickes,On Michelle carter,18,3,20:36:59
Ben Fickes,Played some Godzilla but just got back. Gonna watch a documentary with John and Thiago,86,15,20:36:52
Erica Yee,How's game night,16,3,20:35:57
Erica Yee,Yah having dinner at a nearby taco place first (the restaurant founded by the children of taco truck people who married),120,21,20:35:49
Erica Yee,Pulled pork bun,15,3,20:35:16
Ben Fickes,"What did you get to eat haha. Glad theyâre funny, thatâs a big plus! Are you going to the movie now?",104,21,20:33:34
Erica Yee,And my coworkers are so funny and I didn't know how to say goodbye so I just socialized for a while haha,104,22,20:33:12
Erica Yee,Ok it was a way bigger spread than I was expecting,50,11,20:32:49
Ben Fickes,Hope they do next months before you leave then,46,9,18:00:37
Erica Yee,Think it's once a month,23,5,17:05:23
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Are they doing it again next week,42,9,16:30:36
Erica Yee,Oh apparently thirsty Thursday is actually bbq and drinks on the rooftop patio! But still not going since we're seeing the movie,128,22,16:03:55
Erica Yee,Ooh,3,1,16:03:27
Ben Fickes,Thanks! One of my coworkers brought a Godzilla game Iâm gonna try I think,75,14,14:56:37
Erica Yee,Have fun at game night haha,27,6,14:40:11
Erica Yee,Yah def,7,2,14:39:53
Ben Fickes,I also think itâs really cool/remarkable you get to go with to all these things âas an internâ if that makes sense,120,22,13:35:58
Erica Yee,No worries I know you didn't mean it like that. But yah it's good camaraderie and all that jazz,95,19,13:11:04
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs cool. Yeah sorry didnât mean to sound like I was trash talking it, have never had drinks with coworkers but I know itâs a good social thing",155,29,12:58:39
Erica Yee,And it's totally ok if you go and don't drink,45,10,12:57:40
Erica Yee,Sorta but I think it's actually really good for bonding and relationship building,81,13,12:57:19
Ben Fickes,Dang seems like your coworkers like to go drinking a lot haha,61,12,12:53:50
Ben Fickes,Was gonna ask haha,18,4,12:53:32
Ben Fickes,Itâs the part of your work Iâm most envious of haha,55,11,12:53:26
Erica Yee,(that I'm not going to),23,5,12:53:25
Erica Yee,Actually not having it today tho cuz there's a thirsty Thursday happy hour,74,13,12:53:19
Erica Yee,You remember my schedule better than me,39,7,12:53:06
Erica Yee,OH haha,7,2,12:52:59
Ben Fickes,"Maybe they arenât all memes, my bad",37,7,12:51:34
Ben Fickes,You have videos Thursdays at work right?,40,7,12:51:23
Erica Yee,LOL welp,8,2,12:22:59
Erica Yee,Meme videos?,12,2,12:22:35
Ben Fickes,"Oh and quick story you may appreciate: there is a slight chance I may be learning web dev from one of my coworkers (Owen). He said âIf I teach you, youâll be learning 2000-2010 web development, not react or whatever the cool kids do these days. Because I frankly donât trust it.â",287,52,12:09:14
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, hope you have a good day too! Enjoy your meme videos at work haha",73,15,12:02:42
Erica Yee,Thanks. Hope you have a good day,32,7,11:34:49
Ben Fickes,"Oh did the time change your wrong. Hope it gets better over the course of the day. And Iâm good, gotta go until lunch",119,24,11:32:39
Erica Yee,How are you feeling?,20,4,11:28:47
Erica Yee,I'm tired and cramping a bit. But not too bad,45,10,11:28:44
Erica Yee,Actually still in the car rn lol,32,7,11:28:12

Erica Yee,Josh is going up right?,23,5,11:24:47
Erica Yee,..and don't think I'm free the rest of the week,47,10,11:23:30
Erica Yee,sorry we're gonna go watch Spiderman,36,6,11:22:36
Ben Fickes,"If you wanna talk at all tonight, I should be free after game night. But if youâre busy thatâs fine (nothing pressing on my mind), we can talk another time",159,30,7:04:04
Erica Yee,gnight,6,1,22:48:22
Erica Yee,idk lol,7,2,22:48:20
Ben Fickes,"Also Iâm going to bed, goodnight!",35,6,22:47:19
Ben Fickes,You?,4,1,22:47:11
Ben Fickes,Hmmm canât think of one definitively. But really like all the chocolate pies Iâve had and I like pumpkin and banana cream (separately haha),143,24,22:47:08
Erica Yee,do you have a favorite type of pie,34,8,22:39:51
Erica Yee,ooh nice,8,2,22:39:35
Ben Fickes,We didnât get them much but my dad gave up cakes for New Years one year and so we got him pie for his birthday and Fatherâs Day,131,28,22:36:41
Ben Fickes,They have pretty good pies,26,5,22:36:00
Ben Fickes,Itâs a place (think itâs a chain) but thereâs one really near my house in DE,82,16,22:35:53
Erica Yee,No,2,1,22:35:28
Ben Fickes,Have I told you about Perkins,29,6,22:35:21
Ben Fickes,I think today was my first time having it,41,9,22:35:16
Erica Yee,Idk if I've ever had coconut cream pie,38,8,22:32:40
Erica Yee,And haha nice,13,3,22:32:31
Erica Yee,Ohh ok,6,2,22:32:27
Ben Fickes,"Random work story, I had two slices of pie, one of which was coconut cream, and it made me think of you (though I guess you canât have the cream part now). But then I felt super tired the rest of the day haha",210,44,22:29:14
Ben Fickes,"Joycelyn did but Dan didnât, he starts next week",50,9,22:28:30
Erica Yee,Did Dan and Jocelyn play,24,5,22:19:21
Ben Fickes,"Barns replied to me right before dnd haha, I asked her what service she was going to",84,17,22:05:27
Ben Fickes,"I was at dnd yep! And hope you keep feeling better, and thatâs amazing on the mockup! Lemme know how it goes",110,22,22:05:09
Erica Yee,Story of my life,16,4,20:13:10
Erica Yee,Are you at dnd?,15,4,20:11:16
Erica Yee,"I got a headache cuz my period started (but took meds and it went away). But otherwise my day was really good actually. I made some stuff work and prettier.

Erica Yee,I think male protag is a firefighter? (Was half listening at that point because I was eavesdropping on Bart) and the author said she wrote 75% of it with her thumbs on a Google doc on her phone. Which is inspiring to me lol,223,44,20:53:55

Erica Yee,Please tell Josh happy birthday for us!,39,7,19:37:20
Erica Yee,"Wow. Thank you for that. And for sticking with me when I'm not being as encouraging and affirming as I should be.

Erica Yee,Glad you made it! I got home,28,7,15:03:57
Ben Fickes,"So I know youâre driving but I wanted to capture everything Iâm feeling and tell you about it. After this week and the talk we had in the car, I feel, in addition to being very happy, intense hope and excitement. And I know people usually talk about excitement in relationships in the sense of sexual excitement but, as we have talks like these and listen to each other and think out loud, itâs like I can see our relationship getting stronger as we talk, and I feel a sense of excitement because it makes me believe that, whatever happens, it wonât be able to beat us. And as someone who so often fears things in the future, itâs a miraculous gift to have the hope of someone else beside me in it. Thank you for who you are and all that you do, you truly are a blessing to me and I thank God for you",810,157,15:00:21
Ben Fickes,Wanted to let you know Iâm at my gate!,40,9,14:30:28

Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,20:17:19

Erica Yee,Lmao,4,1,19:48:37
Ben Fickes,Josh texted me to ask if Julia was older or younger than you haha,65,14,19:40:43

Ben Fickes,What would I do without you,27,6,12:11:09
Ben Fickes,Wow thank you for explaining that to me,39,8,12:11:02
Erica Yee,I think it's because they're taking an earlier flight,53,9,12:09:15
Ben Fickes,Idk why but itâs also crazy to me youâll see them before I do,65,14,12:01:52

Erica Yee,But hopefully it'll be a cool experience,40,7,11:25:20

Ben Fickes,"Glad you had a good talk, sorry youâre tired though. Hope you can get some time to rest before tonight (especially since youâre driving, donât want it to literally be a once in a lifetime trip haha). If you canât drive I can always take Bart though of course id love to see you sooner if you can",303,58,10:14:30
Erica Yee,"Stayed up talking and now leaving super early (even though I'm in the same city already) because I'm taking the bus with Leah so I don't miss it, but she has to get to work by 8 lol",181,38,9:42:00

Erica Yee,Lol you'll be fine,18,4,22:56:53
Erica Yee,Am at a Bible study,19,5,22:56:28
Ben Fickes,Iâm dreading the question about what I read. Because of course I love books and stories but not like Iâve seriously read in a while,135,25,22:15:09
Ben Fickes,And I am both excited and terrified,35,7,22:13:55
Ben Fickes,Wait are you going to a bible study or saying you hypothetically would?,71,13,22:13:44
Erica Yee,Also Leah is probably coming to meet you on Saturday ð,57,11,21:56:16
Erica Yee,I'm that person who goes to a Bible study slightly tipsy lol,60,12,21:22:32
Erica Yee,And medium key regretting it,28,5,21:21:31
Erica Yee,Downed a beer faster than I normally would at a bar with my coworkers since I'm heading to meet my friend rn,108,22,21:21:27
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,19:28:05

Erica Yee,One and 70 something,20,4,18:44:05
Ben Fickes,How many? And is there an ideal percent and/or âflavorâ,59,10,18:43:04
Erica Yee,Lol ok whatever you think is best,33,7,18:42:55
Erica Yee,Dark chocolate bar then?,24,4,18:42:15
Ben Fickes,Eh Iâll look into it,22,5,18:42:08
Ben Fickes,Oh but he said the menu mightâve changed,42,8,18:42:04
Ben Fickes,"And itâs near the north end, we walked there Monday and it was closed haha",76,15,18:41:53
Ben Fickes,If itâs something I canât get there Iâll ask my mom to bring it,69,14,18:41:30

2. Is there anything I can bring tomorrow for you or your family?",201,37,18:35:05
Ben Fickes,Oh that stinks for England. And thanks!,39,7,18:34:18
Erica Yee,Have fun at dnd,15,4,18:20:59
Erica Yee,But oh no maybe it doesn't work completely yet,46,9,17:58:22
Erica Yee,Np,2,1,17:58:09
Erica Yee,For offsides,12,2,17:58:02
Erica Yee,It was 2-2 at one point before the England goal got revoked,59,12,17:57:57
Erica Yee,1-Feb,3,1,17:57:46
Ben Fickes,"Also loved the fake fire snap, thanks for sending it haha",57,11,17:56:08
Ben Fickes,Ooh what was the score?,23,5,17:55:54
Erica Yee,Oops accident,13,2,17:50:34
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,17:50:26
Erica Yee,Haha I never realized that,26,5,17:50:24
Erica Yee,"Nvmd can't send it, but she mimed drinking tea with her pinky up",64,13,17:50:19
Erica Yee,And one of our strikers celebrated her goal (on her birthday too) with this,75,14,17:49:36
Erica Yee,And it's close to independence day,34,6,17:49:18
Erica Yee,USA best England,16,3,17:49:11
Ben Fickes,I think thatâs hilarious haha,31,5,17:46:07
Ben Fickes,"Also, Mom was talking and I realized âMr. Yeeâ sounds like âmystery.â",77,12,17:46:00
Ben Fickes,Josh sent me this:,18,4,17:45:54
Ben Fickes,"Way to go! So are you done with python for now? Also, what was your time to tea party snap about (besides World Cup)",116,24,17:45:13
Erica Yee,Learned a lot though so yay,27,6,13:40:48
Erica Yee,Finally finished the python script that's been killing me lol,61,10,13:40:41
Erica Yee,"Not so far, I just can't read news",34,8,13:40:30
Ben Fickes,Dang does that affect your ability to work,42,8,13:38:37
Erica Yee,Wow I thought I was the only one who's chronicle subscription wasn't work but apparently everyone's isn't lol rip,113,19,13:13:54
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,13:13:35
Ben Fickes,Josh made his own Rolf meme after seeing yours,46,9,12:23:30
Erica Yee,Haha yeah,9,2,12:19:33
Ben Fickes,Haha thatâs amazing. Forgot itâs 3 hours earlier there though so not as legendary as I first thought,104,18,12:18:34
Erica Yee,People often roll in late but not everybody on the same day lol,63,13,12:14:40
Erica Yee,Literally no one from the digital team (~10) is here yet,56,11,12:13:49
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,12:13:32
Ben Fickes,Jk hope itâs good,19,4,12:06:13
Ben Fickes,Wow whatâs that,17,3,12:06:08
Erica Yee,And maybe but probably should have a fully invested conversation haha,69,11,12:05:07
Erica Yee,Same,4,1,12:04:50
Ben Fickes,"And gotcha, maybe theyâll like the World Cup too and you can find a place to watch it",87,18,12:01:25
Ben Fickes,"Same (on wanting it to be over), very hard to focus because Iâm mentally checked out haha",91,17,12:01:06
Erica Yee,Getting lunch with new co-worker today but the US world cup semifinals is at noon ahh,85,16,11:34:02
Erica Yee,I like work but honestly want this short week to be over already,64,13,11:33:21
Erica Yee,And looool,10,2,11:33:04
Erica Yee,Sounds good,11,2,11:32:55
Ben Fickes,How are you doing,17,4,11:32:00
Ben Fickes,And unrelated but my coworker thought Iâve been here for three weeks haha,75,13,11:31:56
Ben Fickes,Josh said he laughed out loud at the memes,42,9,11:31:28
Ben Fickes,"Would still like to talk about it sometime though I think, just doesnât have to be anytime soon",97,18,11:31:04
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,10:32:33
Ben Fickes,"Okay Iâm feeling better this morning. And oh my goodness haha ð thank you for sharing these, Iâm gonna show them to Josh",127,23,7:33:00
Erica Yee,I don't understand must of them but the good ones I do,54,12,0:20:42
Erica Yee,Omg the Sega heroes discord has a memes channel now,51,10,0:19:55
Erica Yee,Ah ok. Thanks for letting me know. Praying for rest for you,59,12,0:00:55
Ben Fickes,"Alright so have some stuff on my mind as I lay in bed tonight Iâd love to talk with you about sometime, no idea when because I have dnd tomorrow and then Iâm in CA with you and idk how much time weâll have to talk. But anyways wanted to let you know and hopefully me saying this will help me get it off my mind and fall asleep",332,69,23:52:45
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,22:53:24
Ben Fickes,"Alright Iâm gonna go to bed now, see you soon!",48,10,22:53:05
Erica Yee,Yeah what a gift,16,4,22:50:01
Ben Fickes,I mean what you said but also that her nephew could write about her,67,14,22:48:53
Ben Fickes,Oh dang thatâs amazing,24,4,22:48:36
Erica Yee,Written by her nephew,21,4,22:48:20
Ben Fickes,What,4,1,22:47:48
Erica Yee,Found it,8,2,22:47:30
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, I appreciate it",23,4,22:43:07
Erica Yee,That's so cool,14,3,22:41:57
Ben Fickes,"Yeah mostly, especially for servants sword and reviving water",61,9,22:36:55
Erica Yee,You do tho right?,17,4,22:34:51
Ben Fickes,Just curious,12,2,22:32:19
Erica Yee,Nah I don't think so,20,5,22:32:02
Ben Fickes,Thatâs super amazing! Do you ever have ideas just from your own head,70,13,22:31:12
Erica Yee,Idk,3,1,22:31:00
Erica Yee,And there's no evidence that she corresponded with other authors of her time at all. So all the genius is literally just from her,129,24,22:30:38
Erica Yee,Something fascinating about Jane Austen is she apparently wrote almost exclusively out her own head. Mostly because she didn't get out much. But people related to her also said there were characters in her circles that would've been easy to caricature but she clearly didn't,274,45,22:29:58
Ben Fickes,So do you picture him as a protagonist or side character?,57,11,22:29:33
Erica Yee,And talks kind of shy/hesitantly. But he has such great ideas (he's a designer) and follows up with conversations in a way that's rare so I appreciate,150,27,22:28:02
Erica Yee,He pops up out of nowhere when he has questions which scares me when I have headphones on lol,93,19,22:26:49
Ben Fickes,"No worries, would love to hear if you can describe but no worries if you canât. Ttyl",86,17,21:59:06
Erica Yee,Dinner sorry ttyl,17,3,21:58:45
Erica Yee,Idk exactly how to describe but he's kinda awkward haha,55,10,21:58:38
Erica Yee,Not related to the book but there's this guy I worked with a few times at work that I want to write as a character,114,25,21:58:16
Ben Fickes,If you have any specific ones or scenes,39,8,21:53:39
Ben Fickes,What are some of your ideas,27,6,21:53:32
Ben Fickes,Okay I gotcha,13,3,21:53:25
Erica Yee,Idk how to explain it lol. I just know when I read it i feel it,63,16,21:52:53
Ben Fickes,How do they do that,19,5,21:51:21
Ben Fickes,Oh huh that is super intriguing,31,6,21:51:16
Erica Yee,Also this book is a good example of writing attraction/sexual tension without any actual touching LOL,101,16,21:50:34
Ben Fickes,I wanna hear your ideas haha,28,6,21:50:26
Erica Yee,Yah and their faith features prominently,40,6,21:49:54
Ben Fickes,That they both are Christian?,29,5,21:44:48
Ben Fickes,What would make it Christian,28,5,21:44:34
Ben Fickes,For what little itâs worth Iâd read it haha,47,9,21:44:24
Erica Yee,If it's possible to write a good Christian pride & prejudice LOL,64,12,21:43:56
Ben Fickes,Did you get new ideas from this book specifically,49,9,21:42:48
Erica Yee,"Hmm it gives me ideas, which I guess is related",47,10,21:42:09
Erica Yee,It was. Insight into Muslim community,37,6,21:41:59
Ben Fickes,Does reading good books make you want to write them,51,10,21:37:56
Ben Fickes,"It sounds very interesting from what youâve told me, which I guess isnât much rn haha",89,16,21:37:46
Erica Yee,My mom might read it haha,25,6,21:36:47
Erica Yee,Either,6,1,21:35:06
Ben Fickes,In person or on the phone haha,30,7,21:33:15
Erica Yee,I'll tell you about it next time we talk,40,9,21:32:57
Erica Yee,Soio good (though have a few issues with the writing style),59,11,21:32:45
Ben Fickes,Oh I meant ever finding my bad,30,7,21:31:09
Erica Yee,Is it prevent from never or prevent from finding,48,9,21:30:39
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! How was it?,20,5,21:25:54
Ben Fickes,"âOur headphones may prevent you from never finding love, but at least they stay in!â <laugh track>",102,17,21:25:47
Erica Yee,I am in a romance mood because I already finished the book HAHA what is wrong with me,85,18,21:24:16
Erica Yee,Oh but then you won't fall in love,34,8,21:23:36
Erica Yee,What about a movie that at the end is actually an ad for another headphones company who says their headphones stay in,117,22,21:23:13
Erica Yee,Didn't see the author message till now HAHA yes,47,9,21:22:20
Erica Yee,Sorry was driving,17,3,21:22:07

Ben Fickes,Of course thank you haha,24,5,20:47:56
Erica Yee,Thanks for your content,23,4,20:47:31
Ben Fickes,And Apple can sponsor us,24,5,20:47:27
Ben Fickes,"We have to become famous authors so that we can co-author an amazing, trash final novel thatâs a compilation of airpod romances",129,22,20:47:22
Ben Fickes,Yes please haha,15,3,20:46:51
Ben Fickes,Ah I understand now,19,4,20:46:48
Erica Yee,I'm gonna start an airpod idea doc,34,7,20:45:45
Erica Yee,You being an angle would spice it up,36,8,20:44:44
Ben Fickes,But wait why would spicing it up make me not an angle,53,12,20:40:10
Ben Fickes,"I very much appreciate that Iâm learning your lingo for this haha. I remember you said that (about your high school story, you like when they start out not liking each other)",176,32,20:39:15
Erica Yee,I don't even like love triangles usually,40,7,20:38:16
Erica Yee,But I think I made it up,24,7,20:38:03
Erica Yee,That's what I call part of a love triangle,42,9,20:37:57
Ben Fickes,Whatâs an angle haha,22,4,20:37:33
Erica Yee,Gotta spice it up if you don't want to be an angle,50,12,20:37:12
Ben Fickes,ððð I love it,22,4,20:37:07
Erica Yee,"""here's what I found for 'YOU DROPPED YOUR PHONE'""",50,9,20:35:59
Ben Fickes,Are you embellishing this story in your mind,44,8,20:35:31
Ben Fickes,Hmm I donât know for sure but probably,40,8,20:35:24
Erica Yee,That's connected to airpods,27,4,20:35:06
Erica Yee,Can you hey Siri a phone,24,6,20:34:57
Ben Fickes,They can find me and invite me to their wedding,47,10,20:33:59
Ben Fickes,I would prefer relationship creds,33,5,20:33:47
Ben Fickes,Wow Iâm concerned that my gf is so quick to suggest this,58,12,20:33:39
Ben Fickes,"At first I thought you meant in the story and I was like âwow, I really tried, Ericaâ",89,18,20:33:23
Erica Yee,Wow this is good. You could part of the love triangle,53,11,20:33:19

Ben Fickes,But anyways vaguely reminded me of our story ideas and I guess? could be their meet cute,88,17,20:30:49
Ben Fickes,I was walking off of the T and I saw this girl running after a guy saying âWait! Excuse me!â But he was listening to his AirPods and didnât hear her. So I waved my hand in front of him and pointed to him. And she had his phone and said âyou dropped your phone!â and gave it back to him and that was it,311,65,20:30:24
Ben Fickes,Sorry got distracted typing it now haha,39,7,20:29:43

Ben Fickes,And gotcha. Maybe next time Iâll ask then,43,8,20:15:27
Ben Fickes,"No I know what you meant haha. And yeah it was an hour there and who knows how long we walked for, almost another hour",118,25,20:15:17
Erica Yee,Oh yeah he tends to bring his disease up (I can never remember the name) and then not want to talk about it,107,23,20:14:45
Erica Yee,Isn't that like at least an hour from your work ð®,52,11,20:14:06
Erica Yee,Lol I meant I should not choose opportunities with the end goal of minimizing human interaction,95,16,20:12:32
Ben Fickes,He asked very out of the blue âwhere do you see yourself in 5-10 years?â And we talked a bit about that. He mentioned something about a genetic disease which sounded concerning but didnât elaborate and I didnât press,224,39,19:51:13
Ben Fickes,It was good though,18,4,19:49:31
Ben Fickes,So I walked from my work to Chinatown to meet with Victor. We walked around Chinatown. Then he said he didnât wanna eat anywhere there. So we walked to the north end and ate at a Thai restaurant there because he was afraid the pasta would be expensive,253,48,19:49:19
Ben Fickes,"Have fun though! And that sounds good. Lemme know which ones you do, maybe Iâll tag along (unless there are any you wanna do on your own)",139,27,19:48:20
Erica Yee,Good for you haha (no sarcasm). I think imma try to volunteer for more meaningful things to me than just trying to maximize hours (and minimize human interaction),162,28,19:26:45
Erica Yee,Yeah for cousin's grad party. Also in August literally just for magic castle because my parents are so extra,108,19,19:26:05
Ben Fickes,Btw saw your snap (and the email) on CEP - congrats to us! Think Iâm still gonna try to volunteer though,106,21,17:58:54
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! I didnât even know you were going to LA though. Have fun and Iâd love to hear about it after,105,22,17:23:07
Erica Yee,(the weekend after I go to LA lol. July is so busy),51,12,14:44:01
Erica Yee,"Our weekend Yosemite trip is officially! Going with Calvin, Tiffany, and two of his friends from college. Weekend of July 19",124,21,14:43:48
Ben Fickes,I should be tired but feel fine haha. Hope you get better rest tonight,70,14,12:49:00
Erica Yee,Ooh ok thanks,13,3,12:34:03
Erica Yee,A bit tired but ok. You?,24,6,12:33:57
Ben Fickes,Also itâs alberts birthday and people are wishing him happy birthday in the group chat. Just to let you know haha,115,21,12:33:40
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling today?,26,5,12:28:17
Ben Fickes,"I love it so much haha, thanks for sharing",42,9,12:28:07
Erica Yee,"Uh sure haha, thanks",20,4,12:27:03
Erica Yee,"Ok well when I say interestingggg I'm actually stressing the first syllable. But ""iiiiiinteresting"" is weirder to type",118,18,12:26:49
Ben Fickes,Do you think we should get victor a card-card with his gift card? I can try to get one later and bring it to CA,111,25,12:07:46
Ben Fickes,So when you message âomggggâ I imagine your voice talking in a certain way. But I canât imagine it for interestingggg because the g sounds different. So Iâm curious if you have a pronunciation of it haha,211,37,12:07:13
Erica Yee,Interestingggg thanks,21,2,10:53:24
Ben Fickes,My mom adds âmaybe Norwegianâ,33,5,8:20:27
Ben Fickes,"So if you need one place, Germany haha",38,8,6:44:06
Ben Fickes,"I can ask my mom, sheâll probably know more",45,9,6:43:40
Ben Fickes,"In our family tree, my parents count someone from Germany as 100% German, someone not from Germany as 0%, and anyoneâs children the average of the parentsâ percentage. So using that metric I was told my parents both were âroughly 50%â German (meaning I was too), though at some point in my life my dad said my mom miscounted and shes less than that amount. And I have no idea what the rest is haha. Germany is the only place Iâve heard that my ancestors immigrated from. My grandpa (exactly one time) said something about âthe Fickes family has been great mathematicians all the way since we were in Englandâ but honestly I have no idea if anything he says is true haha. My dad says our last name is Dutch but something he said once made me unsure if it was Dutch or Pennsylvania-Dutch (which is just German haha)",827,150,6:43:16
Ben Fickes,Okay so depends on exactly what you mean but here is as complete an answer as I can give of my ancestry:,104,22,6:35:57
Ben Fickes,"Would love to hear about the book, it sounds interesting to me",62,12,6:35:06
Ben Fickes,Wow thank you for all of this,29,7,6:34:47
Erica Yee,"My dad found it! I remember my mom saying the picture had to be ""anatomically correct""",86,16,1:40:13
Erica Yee,I'm supposed to ask you what's your ancestry (sorry I'm sure you told me but I forgot) also your mom's,102,20,1:26:20
Erica Yee,Omg this book is so good I'm obsessed,37,8,23:47:32
Erica Yee,Food,4,1,22:49:37
Erica Yee,Cover,5,1,22:49:10
Ben Fickes,Aw Iâd love to!,17,4,22:29:23
Erica Yee,"But ask Victor to show you the photo of the fish he caught, I love it he looks so happy",87,20,22:28:59
Erica Yee,Don't think so,14,3,22:28:25
Erica Yee,It was a talk on blockchain technologies and we're nerdy,56,10,22:28:21
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, is the person sheâs marrying also NU grad?",52,9,22:27:50
Ben Fickes,Why was Pat there haha,22,5,22:27:37
Erica Yee,She graduated last year I think. Used to go to agape some,57,12,22:27:34
Erica Yee,For this person that Pat and I awkwardly met at a libertarian club meeting (why was I there),92,18,22:27:23
Ben Fickes,"I love it! And no he didnât, whose wedding?",45,9,22:27:03
Erica Yee,Oh nice. Did he tell you he just went to a wedding,50,12,22:26:49
Erica Yee,The Boston subreddit,20,3,22:26:35
Ben Fickes,Oh btw Iâm meeting victor tomorrow (probably). Have not got his gift card yet,79,14,22:23:46
Ben Fickes,ððð where did you see that?,36,6,22:22:51
Erica Yee,Downtown crossing CVS trying to catch a bird,44,8,22:21:48
Erica Yee,HAHA,4,1,22:21:39
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâll call now,20,4,19:50:01
Ben Fickes,Thatâs amazing! I read your message and thought âwhy is there a newspaper ad for my name?â,96,17,19:49:56
Erica Yee,And ok I'm ready haha,21,5,19:49:07
Erica Yee,Newspaper ad for your name printed on both sides you only see the full picture in light,87,17,19:48:48
Ben Fickes,"Yeah sure, whenever is good for you!",36,7,19:41:24
Erica Yee,"Or rather, in 10 mins",21,5,19:41:11
Erica Yee,I can talk now if you want,26,7,19:40:51
Ben Fickes,Okay thatâs what I thought,28,5,19:19:40

Ben Fickes,HAHA ð well glad they both like each other haha. My flight just landed,73,14,18:07:10
Erica Yee,They talked for 50 mins...,26,5,17:49:43
Erica Yee,"I'm home now, and my mom says she doesn't know why yours is calling haha",72,15,16:52:13
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,16:51:56
Ben Fickes,"Sorry no need to reply but they just said âweâre running the numbers on the new route, seeing if we have enough fuel. Hopefully we do.â I hope I make it to Boston haha",173,34,16:45:42
Erica Yee,Thanks ttyl,11,2,16:33:53
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Well donât wanna take away time from your friends, Iâll ask you about it when we talk later",103,19,16:33:06
Erica Yee,I am with them but am in the car,32,9,16:32:39
Erica Yee,Yeah pasta,10,2,16:32:31

Ben Fickes,What food did you make? Pasta right?,36,7,16:29:13
Erica Yee,Oh what ok,10,3,16:28:39
Ben Fickes,My mom is calling your mom in half an hour apparently haha,58,12,16:24:20

Ben Fickes,How are you feeling now? Very excited to hear about it!,55,11,16:18:21
Erica Yee,He did hold the cheese on my dishes though,42,9,16:12:59
Erica Yee,Though I ate a LOT of stuff I wasn't supposed to since everything was shared..,78,15,16:12:37
Erica Yee,Ok the class was actually pretty fun,36,7,16:12:19
Ben Fickes,Awesome :),10,2,20:48:55

Erica Yee,And yeah the plan is to get dessert,35,8,20:35:11
Erica Yee,Omg lol please don't,20,4,20:34:57
Ben Fickes,"Random convo from my mom earlier:
Mom: are you meeting up with Ericaâs friends on Saturday?
Me: not sure but I think so
Mom: you should wear something nicer than just a t shirt. You want to make a good impression on them",222,43,20:32:08
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Lemme know what you do,30,6,20:31:16
Erica Yee,Want to but don't feel like asking now so we'll see,51,11,20:30:29
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I love the arc of these messages. Are you gonna audit it so you think?,80,17,19:39:49
Erica Yee,False alarm,11,2,18:28:05
Erica Yee,Read a message wrong,20,4,18:28:03
Erica Yee,Wait nvmd I take that all back lol,34,8,18:27:49
Erica Yee,Rip,3,1,18:27:33
Erica Yee,So I guess it's good that I'm not taking the grad class. Thought I was thinking of trying to audit,98,20,18:27:32
Erica Yee,Omg IV lg is Thursdays,22,5,18:27:13
Erica Yee,Appropriate use of ð¤¢,23,4,16:22:42
Ben Fickes,Concerning,10,1,16:04:44
Erica Yee,My alter ego,12,3,13:45:54
Ben Fickes,DopeEr(ic)a,11,1,13:43:46
Erica Yee,"From some random magazine my dad found in a free pile called ""DopeEra""",70,13,13:22:19
Ben Fickes,Oh and who was the eyee from your snap,38,9,13:13:08
Erica Yee,ð¬,4,1,13:07:13
Ben Fickes,Glad I have good (enough) teeth,31,6,12:36:36
Ben Fickes,No I never had them thankfully,30,6,12:36:13
Erica Yee,Did you have braces,19,4,12:29:57
Ben Fickes,Oh dang Iâm really sorry she has to go through that,53,11,12:27:56
Erica Yee,Getting her braces tightened so probably not lol,48,8,12:23:02
Ben Fickes,"Sorry about your sister, hope sheâs doing better today",56,9,12:18:02
Ben Fickes,Jk haha,7,2,12:17:49
Ben Fickes,Hey thatâs Mr. Fickes to you,30,6,12:17:46
Erica Yee,"And LOL thanks Josh, I appreciate it",36,7,12:00:22
Erica Yee,Oh yeah. Glad you found it interesting,38,7,12:00:05
Erica Yee,"Thanks but I stopped asking her because she kept saying we always try to guilt her into stuff she doesn't want to do (which I don't see, so can't explain more lol)",163,32,11:57:20
Erica Yee,I honestly don't have that many thoughts haha.. was reading more to finish than savor but ok,92,17,11:55:00
Ben Fickes,"I asked Josh if he added you to SEGA heroes and he said no. He started opening the app and said really quietly, âIâm sorry, Miss Yeeâ",139,27,7:15:23
Ben Fickes,"Thanks for sharing the article! Everything in the beginning (not that the end didnât) fascinated me, I didnât know about all the stuff the womenâs team was involved with. I think that would be a good article in general but I think itâs especially awesome that itâs addressing things from a Christian standpoint",320,53,7:08:10
Ben Fickes,"Randomly thought of this last night - if you need another bargaining chip for Julia to take your spot in the cooking class, you can tell her Iâll play some game when I visit",175,34,7:03:58
Ben Fickes,"When we talk lemme know what your thoughts on the book are! And thanks for the share, Iâll check it out",105,21,7:03:10
Erica Yee,ooh i like this https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/june-web-only/let-womens-world-cup-get-political.html,111,5,1:23:14
Erica Yee,Finished the book omg,21,4,0:57:34
Ben Fickes,"Alright Iâm home! Going to bed, hope you sleep well and wake up rested",72,14,0:26:36
Erica Yee,Yay glad you made it,20,5,0:02:01
Ben Fickes,Ofc! And haha ð glad you can educate them. Okay Iâm literally at one percent but I just arrived at my train stop! Will text you when I get home,148,30,23:58:04
Erica Yee,"One couple in my parents' small group told us they were going to France, and when I mentioned the world cup they had no idea haha",129,26,23:01:00
Erica Yee,Thanks for sacrificing power to talk to me,42,8,22:57:41
Erica Yee,Ah okay. Can't do tomorrow morning but maybe later in the day,61,12,22:53:52
Ben Fickes,"But before I forget, wanted to let you know that on Sunday my flight is roughly 4-6 eastern, so I probably wonât be able to talk during that window. But should be free otherwise or tomorrow morning if youâre still free this weekend",235,43,22:14:03
Ben Fickes,Actually though my phones at 9% so I should probably save the power until I get home,84,17,22:13:07
Ben Fickes,I will haha,11,3,22:12:43
Erica Yee,Use it wisely lol,17,4,21:57:27
Erica Yee,Oh sad,6,2,21:55:48
Ben Fickes,I left phone and pc chargers in Boston on accident. Can use my mom or joshs phone charger when I get home but Iâm outta luck on pc,132,28,21:54:57
Ben Fickes,Glad to hear it! And yep. Supposed to get back around 2 hours from now ð¬,75,16,21:54:21
Erica Yee,Are you still on the train? Don't remember when you said you were leaving,73,14,21:49:58
Erica Yee,Nah thankfully feeling fine in that department,46,7,21:48:11
Ben Fickes,Headache or no?,15,3,21:37:10
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well even though itâs due if you need to rest thatâs important too,78,14,21:37:05
Ben Fickes,No I donât mind in the slightest I just always wanna help,59,12,21:36:49
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Just tired and trying to finish Rachel held Evan's book before it's due tmr,83,16,21:36:46
Erica Yee,"It's ok, sorry for complaining so much especially when I put myself in this situation",85,15,21:36:06
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling now btw?,28,6,21:31:33
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry not trying to micromanage. Lemme know how it turns out,65,12,21:31:23
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm working on it haha,27,6,21:31:07
Ben Fickes,Idk how close of friends they are but they might understand and could maybe have a friend of theirs who could go as a replacement if Julia doesnât go,151,29,21:30:51
Erica Yee,"One of them, but was waiting for Julia to say yes",49,11,21:30:40
Ben Fickes,Have you told your friends?,27,5,21:30:06
Erica Yee,"Yeah I'm paying for her, idk why she won't take it..",52,11,21:29:59
Erica Yee,But I feel bad if I cancel since the gifts covers 2.5 people,60,13,21:29:44
Ben Fickes,And thatâs why youâre trying to bribe your sister,53,9,21:29:33
Ben Fickes,Oh oh I see,11,4,21:29:25
Erica Yee,More like I can't just say no. Have to find a replacement or try to cancel,74,16,21:29:15
Erica Yee,Oh that's not what I meant,26,6,21:28:54
Ben Fickes,You could ask to transfer it to a different name if that doesnât work?,72,14,21:28:51
Ben Fickes,Do they check id? Guess you probably have no way of knowing,59,12,21:28:35
Erica Yee,I made the reservation ð¬ but hopefully can cancel one,56,10,21:27:43
Ben Fickes,Well if itâs really taxing for you you can probably tell them no now and theyâll understand. If itâs just an annoying level well maybe itâll be good,156,28,21:19:40
Erica Yee,Ugh I should've just said no to my friends in the first place,61,13,21:18:58
Erica Yee,Any game,8,2,21:18:35
Ben Fickes,Ooh what game,13,3,21:15:18
Erica Yee,Trying to bribe my sister to go with a family game,50,11,21:14:45
Ben Fickes,Please survive your allergies,29,4,21:01:48
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs right,17,3,21:01:41
Ben Fickes,Aw thanks. If you donât clean it itâll still be cleaner than my apartment haha,82,15,21:01:36
Erica Yee,And then I have that cooking class on Sunday that I really don't want to do,75,16,21:01:18
Erica Yee,Hmm we're cleaning the condo tomorrow,37,6,21:01:03
Ben Fickes,Are you doing anything this weekend,35,6,20:41:17
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,20:41:07
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,20:40:51
Ben Fickes,The other Erika? (Or I guess not âthe otherâ since your name is spelled different),86,15,20:40:06
Erica Yee,But can't say too much from brief first impression,50,9,20:39:35
Erica Yee,Very awkwardly met the new candidate too,40,7,20:39:16
Erica Yee,"It's just for the wide templates, but yeah it's cool to add something to the template that affects stories going forward and in the past",136,25,20:38:55
Erica Yee,Lol thanks,10,2,20:38:31
Ben Fickes,Maybe Iâm overreacting haha but I think stuff that improves the process for everyone is super cool,100,17,20:38:19
Ben Fickes,Erica thatâs amazing!!! Thatâs something everyone else can use forever now,78,11,20:37:45
Erica Yee,"""by hand"" with code lol",23,5,20:37:09
Erica Yee,That was JavaScript tho ^,25,5,20:37:01
Erica Yee,I was happy I figured out this script this morning that automatically replaces all images in stories with higher res ones on bigger screen sizes. Everyone appreciated it since we used to have to do each photo by hand,216,39,20:36:53
Erica Yee,Ok it actually didn't break the website haha. Just the way we get data (which is not automatically piped into the website),122,22,20:35:28
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,20:34:54
Ben Fickes,Sorry for all the questions haha,32,6,20:34:50
Erica Yee,Probably front end but I'm glad I'm getting to learn more python,64,12,20:34:47
Ben Fickes,Oh man thatâs so sad haha. So youâre fixing it for new website or starting over?,84,16,20:34:43
Erica Yee,"Or like, the data pipeline",26,5,20:34:25
Erica Yee,Nah this was a new task I just got cuz the fire department changed their website which broke our fire tracker,109,21,20:34:07
Ben Fickes,Do you like back end or front end better?,41,9,20:33:55
Erica Yee,But doing this back-end thing is such a pivot from web dev for top 100.,71,15,20:33:37
Ben Fickes,Oh I remember you telling me about the fire one I think. Unless Iâm confusing it with something else haha,107,20,20:33:31
Erica Yee,LOL nah that thing is done,26,6,20:33:03
Erica Yee,The script is supposed to scrape this csv from the California fire website and send any updates to a slack channel,114,21,20:32:42
Ben Fickes,Oh Whoah thatâs amazing. And gotcha. Is this the console one?,63,11,20:32:31
Erica Yee,It was good. Stayed a bit late because I was trying to hammer out this python script. Didn't completely finish it but hopefully close,133,24,20:32:03
Erica Yee,Apparently the paintings are all ones that Randall Park's mom actually did,74,12,20:31:09
Erica Yee,Oh,2,1,20:30:43
Ben Fickes,How was work,12,3,20:30:41
Ben Fickes,Anyways Iâll have more thoughts when we talk Iâm sure,57,10,20:30:37
Ben Fickes,Her painting of the bird in the nest. She starts with the nest but then the bird flies away,91,19,20:30:25
Erica Yee,But yay glad you liked it,25,6,20:30:16

Erica Yee,What did she even say that about,32,7,20:29:41
Ben Fickes,"Seriously liked it, thought Marcus (and his dad) were very funny. Definitely a few parts that were a little racy for my tastes but thatâs pretty standard haha",160,28,19:29:07
Ben Fickes,Finished the movie. Will have more thoughts later Iâm sure but my number one take away is that if I can punch Keanu Reeves youâll be helplessly in love with me forever,171,32,19:28:53
Ben Fickes,"Sorry know youâre at work but Iâm starting always be my maybe and when Marcusâs mom says âstart with the thing that can fly away,â Iâm calling that they use that as a metaphor later. Anyways wanted to log my prediction haha",235,42,17:49:23
Ben Fickes,On my way home to DE now,24,7,17:43:30
Erica Yee,Loool,5,1,17:23:44

Erica Yee,Omggg,5,1,21:19:59
Ben Fickes,"So as it would turn out I by chance discovered today that a new feature I implemented can lock you out of the game (in rare instances). So at end of day I was scrambling for a fix and after fixing it my coworker said âeh, letâs do it tomorrow, they have to approve the patch anywaysâ",289,57,20:11:02
Erica Yee,Lol,3,1,17:08:11

Ben Fickes,Haha nice. Iâm really looking forward to it! And oh dang. At least you donât have to sit in the big bossâs office. Are you moving to this desk when he leaves?,164,32,12:08:53
Erica Yee,(This is the supervisor who's leaving next week..),50,8,12:02:53
Erica Yee,I usually sit at whatever desk is empty. But today there are none except the big boss who has his own office. So I'm sitting at my supervisor's desk and he's sitting in the big boss' office ð¬,194,38,12:00:25
Erica Yee,"Apparently my relatives know some ""secret"" place in the hills lol",65,11,11:29:03

Erica Yee,"Oh no worries, I can look it up now",35,9,21:22:59

Erica Yee,No idea haven't listened/watched since I was on the way home,60,11,21:20:13
Ben Fickes,What would you say? Curious on your thoughts haha,49,9,21:19:30
Erica Yee,Lol I'm in the channel so I could actually message there and it would show up ðð,86,17,21:18:10
Ben Fickes,Iâm gonna find a way to spam the feedback survey with âErica Yeeâs personal interestsâ,94,15,21:17:23
Erica Yee,"Though we have the other way too for ""what do you want us to write about"" feedback surveys",90,18,21:16:30
Erica Yee,"Oh no, the opposite",19,4,21:15:47
Ben Fickes,Oh wow! So when people comment on stuff it comes in as a slack message?,71,15,21:15:26
Erica Yee,One of my bosses developed this super cool thing that enables live chats on the chronicle website piped in through SLACK MESSAGES!!!,132,22,21:13:59
Erica Yee,Lol think of it more as speed dating,36,8,21:12:42
Erica Yee,Thanks I will,13,3,21:12:20
Ben Fickes,We are actually watching the debate haha,40,7,21:08:54
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs great! Lemme know when itâs up! Way to go on all the work youâve done on this,93,19,21:08:46
Erica Yee,Top 100 might actually go live tonight as scheduled which would be amazing,74,13,20:30:35
Erica Yee,My day was fixing dozens of small bugs,38,8,20:30:17
Erica Yee,Aww,3,1,20:30:05
Ben Fickes,Work was very exhausting today. Accidentally found a huge bug and took forever to deal with. How was your day?,110,20,17:53:53
Ben Fickes,Iâm in Boston if they ever wanna drop by,42,9,17:40:29
Erica Yee,"No way, they gotta work if they want to see you",47,11,16:39:19
Ben Fickes,It doesnât rhyme but itâs good enough for a slogan,54,10,16:35:23
Ben Fickes,Our slogan can be âBring Ben to Themâ,41,8,16:34:54
Ben Fickes,If they canât make it you can drive us to their houses,56,12,16:34:40
Erica Yee,It's gonna happen.. hopefully ð¬,34,5,13:41:24

Erica Yee,You'll be great,15,3,12:27:11
Erica Yee,You'll be fine,14,3,12:27:09
Erica Yee,(also my family is not thaaat materialistic I'm mostly kidding),63,10,12:27:06
Ben Fickes,Maybe you should ride one on rollercoaster tracks,49,8,12:26:47
Erica Yee,But I'm not really into rollercoasters haha,43,7,12:26:22
Ben Fickes,Jk I have never ridden either,29,6,12:25:13
Ben Fickes,I can imagine you riding and getting addicted to the adrenaline rush and riding for the rest of your life,105,20,12:25:05
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð âI went into computer science just so that I would be financially secure for Ericaâ,97,17,12:24:35
Erica Yee,But so dangerous,16,3,12:24:29
Erica Yee,I want to ride a motorcycle for like 2 seconds just to see what it's like,73,16,12:24:25
Erica Yee,Wow,3,1,12:24:12
Erica Yee,"""computer science"" => financial stability so just keep that as your story",73,12,12:23:52
Ben Fickes,Hope you have a good day at work!,33,8,12:23:23

Ben Fickes,Iâve actually been posing this whole time,43,7,12:22:56
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,12:16:30
Erica Yee,No idea..you go to college so think you're fine lol,51,10,12:16:28
Ben Fickes,And I couldnât contact them (the line I found was disconnected) so I contacted the help line on their credit card and they cancelled it,137,25,12:08:53
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Any tips or pointers you have for when I meet your extended family haha,80,16,12:08:18
Erica Yee,And loool I'm impressed,23,4,11:00:58
Erica Yee,"Ah good for you, hope it gets back to them",42,10,11:00:44
Erica Yee,The ones who hosted the graduation/birthday parties last weekend. And my grandparents would come too probably,109,16,11:00:18
Erica Yee,Uh I didn't send anything but it's gone?,40,8,10:58:21
Erica Yee,"OHH ok I was like, I don't see an hourglass in the snap..",57,13,10:58:09
Ben Fickes,And I made a pbj with only a chopstick because it was the only clean utensil we have,84,18,8:25:22
Ben Fickes,"To update you on my morning, I found a credit card on my run Iâm going to try to get back to its owner",104,24,8:25:00

Ben Fickes,Hourglass is when weâre about to lose our streak,50,9,6:31:59
Erica Yee,Also my relatives high key want to meet you (they're sending desperate emails after my mom dropped you guys were visiting..) so we might try to do dinner after the baseball game on the 4th,188,35,23:01:13
Erica Yee,And I didn't understand your hourglass snap (if you still remember in the morning),82,14,22:59:47
Erica Yee,Good job,8,2,22:59:26
Erica Yee,Ok I look forward to reading/listening,38,6,22:59:25
Ben Fickes,Also because I replied to your email I remembered to sign up for summit haha,76,15,22:31:54
Ben Fickes,"Sent my music email response, fewer (and arguably less deep) songs, but heavy on text haha. Please take your time responding and Iâm really sorry I mentioned it so much last time",180,32,22:22:19
Ben Fickes,Iâm gonna listen to your songs now,36,7,20:56:58

Ben Fickes,How are you doing congestion and foot wise?,43,8,20:52:52
Ben Fickes,"Sounds right, and if not you have me fully convinced haha",57,11,20:52:24
Erica Yee,(if that's the right word from what I learned in fundies lmao),62,12,20:51:49
Erica Yee,Uhhh basically abstracting something,36,4,20:51:49
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice! What was your suggestion, if you can explain",53,10,20:46:16
Erica Yee,"I made a suggestion about the implementation of a key part and they said go for it, which was cool",98,20,20:14:14
Erica Yee,But top 100 is in pretty good shape now,39,9,20:13:52
Erica Yee,It was pretty good. The other lead developer came back from Iceland and got lots of last minute projects thrown at him,118,22,20:12:47
Erica Yee,Oh yikes,8,2,20:12:05
Ben Fickes,How was work?,13,3,20:08:10

Erica Yee,Play on,7,2,18:24:37
Ben Fickes,Not cancelled sadly,19,3,17:30:40
Erica Yee,Oooh,4,1,15:51:27
Ben Fickes,"Chance rain might cancel soccer nights, so I might get to either watch Always Be My Maybe or listen to your songs",113,22,12:33:58

Ben Fickes,"He played Minecraft with kids a lot haha, I have a story for you for when we talk. And gotcha, hope itâs better today",119,24,6:32:12

Erica Yee,"No worries, how was his work",28,6,22:33:01
Ben Fickes,NBA story sounds right up your alley! And are you feeling okay?,63,12,21:30:54
Ben Fickes,Sorry was talking with Josh. He had his first day of work today,63,13,21:30:38
Erica Yee,I'm congested and probably sound terrible so my boss sent me home a bit early,77,15,20:35:04
Erica Yee,"It's really cool tho, 10th anniversary of Steph Curry's draft",61,10,20:34:21
Erica Yee,"I didn't touch top 100 at all even though it's coming out Thursday and definitely not done, cuz I worked on this story coming out tomorrow for which they gave us the audio yesterday ð¬",186,35,20:34:03

Ben Fickes,How was work,12,3,20:30:38
Ben Fickes,And got to see pastor Larry judging his son haha,48,10,20:30:34
Ben Fickes,Oh I was referee for the game btw,33,8,20:30:23
Ben Fickes,Then I feel like it would be really upsetting that they lost to two PKs. Which is exactly what you just said my bad haha,120,25,20:30:09
Erica Yee,Nah it was in regular play,26,6,20:27:53
Ben Fickes,Was Spainâs a PK? And wow Iâm becoming quite the global citizen with all the teams I can commiserate with,109,20,20:26:54
Erica Yee,"US baaaarrreeeelllyyyy beat them 2-1, with both goals PKs..",59,9,20:24:38
Erica Yee,You can commiserate with Spain this time,40,7,20:24:27
Erica Yee,Oh wow that is a relief,23,6,20:24:20
Ben Fickes,Yes! We lost our scrimmage to the Netherlands 2-1. But no one had a meltdown or was even upset and that is such a blessing haha,127,26,20:21:34
Erica Yee,England??,9,1,20:18:47
Ben Fickes,Just finished soccer nights. Super tiring haha. I have pastor Larryâs kid haha,80,13,20:17:54

Ben Fickes,Iâll explain more when we talk haha,37,7,23:05:34
Ben Fickes,The list of stuff for us to talk about haha. In general it made me think a lot about our minds and some about faith. So after I went to read the Bible and opened up to the story of Legion and the demoniac,204,44,23:05:08
Erica Yee,Didn't you just watch it,24,5,23:04:21
Erica Yee,What do you mean to your list,29,7,23:04:13
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I added it to my list and have many thoughts for next time we talk,79,17,23:03:57

Ben Fickes,Are you saying like enough he could ask someone out to dinner,61,12,21:19:01
Ben Fickes,Well I guess if thereâs two of us getting the gift we should probably,71,14,21:18:49
Erica Yee,Do we get him enough to go with someone else haha,49,11,21:18:22
Ben Fickes,Alright sounds good haha,24,4,21:18:04
Erica Yee,Ohh we can split if you want,28,7,21:17:43
Ben Fickes,So do you want me to get the gift card on your behalf? Or we can split it as a gift from both of us? Not sure if thatâs weird or not haha,139,33,21:16:41
Erica Yee,Dumpling palace ð but yeah that one sounds good,50,9,21:15:58
Ben Fickes,"He was also willing to go to Chinatown, idk if anywhere there has gift cards",76,15,21:14:58
Ben Fickes,"Meaning in general good idea for gift card, doesnât have to be there",70,13,21:14:41
Ben Fickes,Hmmm well we went to the dumpling house/palace (by where I live) for the board game night and he seemed to like it. He might go if he had a gift card so good call haha,167,36,21:14:25
Erica Yee,Where's somewhere that he likes above Wendy's price point,57,9,21:13:39
Erica Yee,But idk if he likes that place and I do haha,44,11,21:13:25
Erica Yee,"Actually, I did get a pho basil gift card from some school thing I won. Maybe I'll have you bring it back for him",113,24,21:13:00
Erica Yee,I complimented him and was left on read ð,44,9,21:12:09
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you he got a haircut,31,8,21:11:11
Ben Fickes,Of course! Lemme know whatever you need me to do,48,10,21:11:05
Erica Yee,I'm thinking of getting a restaurant gift card for Victor for his birthday. Do you think you could help pick it up and give it please haha,138,27,21:10:40
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,21:06:03
Erica Yee,Just a small part of top 100 restaurants project. Doesn't matter since it's not live yet,88,16,21:05:25
Ben Fickes,Oh no what,10,3,21:04:25
Erica Yee,Oh well will fix tomorrow morning,33,6,21:02:31
Erica Yee,I just realized I pushed something that doesn't work,52,9,21:02:26
Erica Yee,Haha thanks,11,2,21:02:10
Ben Fickes,You can still come if you want Iâm sure ð,46,10,21:01:37
Ben Fickes,Yep,3,1,21:01:28
Erica Yee,Is wambledon Michael's thing,28,4,21:00:48
Erica Yee,Sure Sunday should be good,26,5,21:00:39
Ben Fickes,Would you be free at all to talk this weekend? I have Daraâs birthday party Friday and Wambledon on Saturday but I should be free all of Sunday,145,28,20:43:03
Ben Fickes,Ooh way to go!,14,4,20:42:15
Erica Yee,But they liked it,17,4,20:27:22
Erica Yee,And that editor is known for being harsh about these things,59,11,20:27:19
Erica Yee,We showed what we've done on the top 100 to the food team and were afraid they'd hate it or ask for some crazy hard feature,123,26,20:26:54
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! What made it possibly contentious,42,7,17:04:39
Erica Yee,Meeting that had the potential to be very contentious actually was fine ð,76,13,16:51:14
Erica Yee,Removable stall graffiti,24,3,16:10:32
Erica Yee,Oh interesting haha,19,3,16:10:21
Ben Fickes,Itâs a bunch of letters youâd put on a refrigerator but theyâre on the outside of a stall. People make words. Iâll try to stealth take a pic sometime,157,29,15:08:22
Erica Yee,You did not,11,3,13:36:09
Ben Fickes,Yeah same. Plus working from home requires setup and Iâm lazy haha,68,12,12:53:09
Ben Fickes,Very random but did I tell you about the magnetic letters in the bathroom?,74,14,12:52:54
Erica Yee,My supervisor mentioned offhand once that I could work from home if I wanted to but I really don't. I like coming to the office and having that separation,154,29,12:52:49
Erica Yee,Samee,5,1,12:51:42
Ben Fickes,Yeah I sometimes get emails from people sent at 8 or later and Iâm glad Iâm just an intern who can leave at 6 every day haha,128,27,12:31:52
Ben Fickes,Dang,4,1,12:31:26
Erica Yee,When I see on GitHub that my supervisor worked on our project throughout last night ð¶ð¶,92,16,12:18:44
Erica Yee,Thanks haha,11,2,12:09:33
Ben Fickes,*sell,5,1,12:06:01
Ben Fickes,"Donât seek yourself short, youâre good at programming. But hopefully you get to talk to her some!",101,17,12:02:13
Erica Yee,Wow just saw that the new business reporting intern studies polisci and cs. she very likely knows way more programming than me LOL. Really want to talk to her,158,29,11:59:46
Erica Yee,I like how everyone's face is cut off a little differently,58,11,11:03:39
Erica Yee,And aw nice haha,16,4,11:03:24
Erica Yee,No idea,7,2,11:03:21
Ben Fickes,Michaels first selfie ever,26,4,7:58:51
Ben Fickes,Pic from last night,19,4,7:58:45
Ben Fickes,"Dang thatâs crazy, thanks for sharing. Why do you think they have so many international students?",99,16,6:36:41
Erica Yee,Nothing really new but that stat ð®ð®,41,7,23:11:37
Erica Yee,"""Today the school enrolls more international vocational students than any other school in the country, by far, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data""",165,24,23:11:31
Erica Yee,https://calmatters.org/articles/bethel-church-redding-california-modern-christian-culture/,90,1,23:11:20
Erica Yee,Haha no prob,12,3,22:58:12
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâll look tomorrow sorry,31,5,22:57:47
Ben Fickes,Wait I messed up itâs not an email,36,8,22:57:39
Ben Fickes,No rush of course but I will forget again if I donât send it now haha,71,16,22:56:15
Ben Fickes,Ah before I forget entirely Iâm gonna try to find joshs email,63,12,22:56:02
Erica Yee,Gnight :),9,2,22:55:30
Ben Fickes,Okay haha. Sorry Iâm gonna go to bed but hope you have a good evening,71,15,22:55:04
Erica Yee,"I use the word ""weird"" probably too liberally so not really",59,11,22:51:01
Ben Fickes,If not thatâs absolutely okay haha,36,6,22:50:38
Ben Fickes,Do you have thoughts,20,4,22:50:11
Erica Yee,Lol ok,6,2,22:49:22
Ben Fickes,And many lines have been drawn between âitâs weirdâ and âtheyâre weirdâ,83,12,22:47:37
Ben Fickes,It has evolved rapidly. And honestly I donât think I can capture it all. But is it okay to say âthatâs weirdâ basically. So yeah,136,25,22:47:07
Erica Yee,Like whether it's ok to call them weird?,40,8,22:45:24
Ben Fickes,So Shem and John are now having a debate over whether or not itâs weird (or okay to call weird) people who are in relationships with anime characters (because John found a waifuism subreddit),193,34,22:41:56
Ben Fickes,Basically nothing happened haha. Except Josh and RenÃ©e characters threatened each otherâs lives for a very heated moment and I tried to keep the peace,153,25,22:39:35
Erica Yee,And aww how was it,18,5,22:27:06
Erica Yee,Not going,9,2,22:27:02
Ben Fickes,Also just had the last dnd session where weâll all be together,64,12,22:22:25
Ben Fickes,Youâre not going right? Or did you change your mind haha,58,11,22:21:54
Ben Fickes,Ah I see,8,3,22:21:44
Erica Yee,Ooh good job,12,3,22:07:18
Erica Yee,That's just what we call the JavaScript/css stuff we do to tweak the built-in templates,87,15,22:07:08
Ben Fickes,Yes but I have not officially signed up yet haha,48,10,21:57:46
Ben Fickes,But now I have analytics before I can program new characters,60,11,21:57:29
Ben Fickes,I finished the mega super feature haha,38,7,21:57:13
Ben Fickes,Ooh what kind of hackery?,25,5,21:57:02
Erica Yee,Are you going to summit lol,27,6,20:15:34
Erica Yee,How was yours?,14,3,20:08:56
Erica Yee,It was fine. A project we thought wouldn't take that long became way more complicated lol. But learned a lot of hackery from it,127,24,20:08:50
Ben Fickes,How was/is your day going? No rush to reply,43,9,17:32:11
Erica Yee,Funn,4,1,15:30:57
Ben Fickes,Thatâs it haha. Hope it wasnât TMI,38,7,14:51:10
Ben Fickes,Had to use a plunger to unclog the toilet someone else used at work,67,14,14:50:58
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope work is good,25,5,12:25:59
Erica Yee,Hurts some but alright,22,4,12:09:32
Ben Fickes,How is your foot?,17,4,12:02:24
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,12:02:20
Erica Yee,It's ok,7,2,11:35:04
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,11:34:55
Ben Fickes,"Will properly reply to your email via email later after I listen to the songs, but wanted to say that youâre absolutely right on the lyrics for the first one - I woke up in the middle of the night and thought âdid I get the lyrics wrong when I sent the email?â I tried to convince myself I did but I never checked haha",324,65,7:58:15
Ben Fickes,Hope you have a good day today! :),34,8,6:59:00
Ben Fickes,"Okay, Iâm glad, and thank you so much for listening to it! It really means the world",86,17,6:58:52
Erica Yee,I'm gonna listen to it now,26,6,22:39:59
Erica Yee,Thanks for telling me. You didn't make me feel guilty about it (I see it everyday when I check my email anyway haha ð¬),121,24,22:39:54
Ben Fickes,Goodnight for real and hope you sleep well when you go to bed!,62,13,22:26:14
Ben Fickes,"Was praying before bed and just wanted to apologize for bringing up the music email. I know you care about it and I hope I didnât make you feel stressed or guilty by bringing it up, and I just wanted to say Iâm sorry for bringing it up when it doesnât help anything. Maybe this seems like a lot over nothing but it was on my mind and I think telling you is the right thing to do",384,78,22:26:02
Erica Yee,Sleep well!,11,2,22:11:24
Erica Yee,Don't want to,13,3,22:11:15
Ben Fickes,"Also Iâm gonna go to bed, night!",34,7,22:10:59
Ben Fickes,Are you wearing the boot tomorrow,33,6,22:10:37
Erica Yee,Ooh interesting,15,2,22:05:02
Erica Yee,Author was on a podcast I listened to,37,8,22:04:46
Ben Fickes,Oh also very random but I talked to one of my coworkers about church yesterday. Will tell you over the phone about it sometime,126,24,21:12:28
Ben Fickes,"I think she is but she might have a role thatâs for both teams (I donât know what she does, except itâs not game design or programming because she doesnât sit in our area). I asked her what school she went to and she says sheâs not in school. So Iâm wondering if itâs just a job theyâre calling an internship so they can pay her less? Idk",354,68,21:10:24
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð what made you look up the textbook? And oh my goodness Iâm sorry you had to stand and that someone stepped on your foot, I hope itâs doing alright",160,31,21:08:44
Erica Yee,And then someone stepped on my foot ð,40,8,20:26:00
Erica Yee,"Whatever, doesn't matter what strangers think of me lol",55,9,20:25:39
Erica Yee,WOW I never sit down on bart while commuting since I don't need to. Today I decide to take an empty seat for once because of my foot. This older woman asks me for me seat because she has a bad back so I can't refuse...,218,46,20:25:03
Erica Yee,Lol I looked up this theology textbook and it's randomly available at Target (though sold out). Idk why I find this so funny but wanted to share,144,27,20:20:24
Erica Yee,Nope are they on your team?,27,6,20:19:28
Erica Yee,Ooh cool,8,2,20:19:19
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you thereâs a second intern now?,45,9,20:18:16
Ben Fickes,"Hope your foot is better. But thatâs good haha! Mine was good, was told to submit my long-worked on code because it âmight not be brokenâ (which I think it is but oh well). And I did some character stuff too and found a bug which is nice",243,48,20:18:07
Erica Yee,How was yours,13,3,20:14:21
Erica Yee,I actually figured out something in react before Lucio haha,59,10,20:14:20
Erica Yee,Productive at work. Foot probably worsened by broken shoe,57,9,20:13:44
Ben Fickes,Iâm playing dnd so will not be able to reply but how was your day?,68,15,20:13:11
Erica Yee,Lmaoo,5,1,20:09:49
Ben Fickes,I didnât really get into FB cuz I knew it would suck my time away. Good thing. Now I have all that time for SEGA Heroes.,122,26,18:42:56
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! To both haha. My mom sent me this today (out of the blue):,67,15,18:42:42
Erica Yee,Getting there,13,2,18:37:56
Erica Yee,I'm at level 12,15,4,18:37:52

Ben Fickes,Did I tell you my mom got SEGA heroes?,38,9,18:02:26
Ben Fickes,Thanks for the clarification haha. Actually got a lot done today strangely enough haha,86,14,18:01:33
Erica Yee,Tonight,7,1,17:10:27
Erica Yee,Hope you can rest ton,21,5,17:10:25
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,17:10:16
Erica Yee,Eh it's fine. Boot just squeaks when I walk which is annoying,61,12,17:10:14
Ben Fickes,I have never been this close to falling asleep at work,54,11,16:52:45
Ben Fickes,Dang. How is your foot feeling now btw? Any worse after losing the boot?,72,14,16:52:20
Erica Yee,Top**,5,1,14:50:13
Erica Yee,Too*,4,1,14:50:11
Erica Yee,Oh And the boot still has the too part so uh,44,11,14:50:06
Erica Yee,Thanka,6,1,14:49:48
Erica Yee,We'll see haha,14,3,14:49:46
Ben Fickes,"Oh no, so does one foot just have a sock? And wow that would scare me but also I think youâll do great ð",109,24,14:33:46
Erica Yee,Also my supervisor isn't here this morning (he's out shooting photos for another project) so I'm just kinda making design decisions ð¬,136,22,13:24:25
Erica Yee,Time to have a real limp,24,6,13:24:04
Erica Yee,Oops it fell off now,20,5,13:24:00
Erica Yee,The cast boot my mom made me where just broke (like the sole is almost falling off ) UGH knew I should've brought my other shoe,127,26,13:14:22
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,13:13:56
Ben Fickes,I will send you joshs email when I get a chance,47,11,12:56:06
Ben Fickes,"No itâs good! I appreciate it greatly, really, and I donât wanna make you feel pressure, I know you have a ton of stuff going on and donât wanna stress you out",165,32,12:55:53
Erica Yee,I know I've been saying it but I will get to your music email when I can dedicate a good chunk of time and emotional capacity,125,26,12:54:32
Erica Yee,Sorry sorry,11,2,12:54:03
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I owe you that email haha, Iâll send it sometime but donât want to overwhelm you with many pending emails haha",119,22,12:47:20
Erica Yee,Oh yeah i remember you said he had some games on itch.io that you would show me sometime,88,18,12:37:10
Erica Yee,Oh wow!,7,2,12:36:45
Ben Fickes,Josh said he found a playthrough of one of his games online! Have not watched it but here it is: https://youtu.be/TCC3_TAmux0,125,21,12:25:49
Ben Fickes,Oh nice haha,12,3,12:25:08
Erica Yee,Pop band that's siblings,24,4,12:06:29
Erica Yee,Pretty sure it's the lead singer of echosmith,45,8,12:06:09
Erica Yee,Oh lol,6,2,12:05:46
Ben Fickes,I didnât recognize who it was and until this moment I thought it was some female Christian singer,99,18,12:03:12
Erica Yee,As first I thought it was for a movie or something but guess not?,65,14,11:18:35
Erica Yee,"Seemed like a normal fk&c song. If I wasn't looking, would've just thought it was some female Christian singer featured",119,20,11:18:26
Ben Fickes,Dang sorry to hear that. What were your thoughts on it?,55,11,11:15:30
Erica Yee,Ohh lol it was intriguing,25,5,11:03:20
Erica Yee,Only a little bruised so probably not broken,44,8,11:02:52
Erica Yee,Ugh wearing this cast shoe,26,5,11:02:42
Ben Fickes,Also I listened to the FK&C remix you snapped this morning - thanks for the indirect recommendation haha,104,18,10:20:00
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð well let me know how it feels today,45,10,6:31:58
Erica Yee,Lol so,6,2,23:10:08
Erica Yee,"Mom: the question is do you need to get am x-ray
Me: no
Mom: that's what I said when I broke my foot!
Me: but I can walk
Mom: THAT'S WHAT I SAID",144,33,23:10:06
Erica Yee,Not as of now,13,4,23:08:14
Ben Fickes,Are you going to the doctor? I know your mom is one though haha,63,14,23:00:47
Erica Yee,oops,4,1,22:52:37
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Erica,20,4,22:44:27
Erica Yee,Maybe both ð¤·,15,3,22:37:08
Ben Fickes,I will haha,11,3,21:20:59
Erica Yee,Stay tuned,10,2,21:13:58
Erica Yee,Oh wait maybe not,17,4,21:13:55
Erica Yee,Nvmd apparently I don't know anatomy and it is my ankle lmao,60,12,21:13:06
Ben Fickes,Sorry that happened,19,3,20:50:33
Erica Yee,Different,9,1,20:48:35
Ben Fickes,Was it the one who cooked or a different one?,45,10,20:47:31
Ben Fickes,Oh noooo Iâm so sorry,23,5,20:47:18
Erica Yee,One of the staff she just hired rescinded her acceptance last night ugj,71,13,20:46:36
Erica Yee,Welp my mom was too tired to freak out. She just gave a long sigh,65,15,20:46:14
Erica Yee,May the odds be ever in your favor,34,8,20:45:57
Ben Fickes,And whoah that's exciting! Lemme know what it is haha,53,10,20:41:34
Ben Fickes,"So I thought it was a race condition because it occasionally fails to track a login but rarely. But I was told by the smartest engineer here that it is not the case and I dug more and I realized, like he said, a lot more would break if so. So I put in break points but none have been triggered because the error never occurred again. So I'm just waiting for a lucky bootup",372,75,20:41:22
Erica Yee,Not gonna check till tomorrow haha,34,6,20:40:55
Erica Yee,Just got a work notification (I'm ooo now) that I got put as a project lead for something uhh,93,19,20:40:37
Ben Fickes,Dang. Not that it helps but I hope you feel better. And hope your mom is alright haha,85,18,20:39:16
Erica Yee,How's the big feature you're working on,39,7,20:38:41
Erica Yee,Telling my mom in t-2 minutes so readying for freak out,55,11,20:38:33
Erica Yee,Uhh limping sorta heavily,25,4,20:38:23
Ben Fickes,How is your foot,16,4,20:38:02
Erica Yee,Lol ok np,9,3,20:37:50
Ben Fickes,"So uh kinda weird to say this but I promised I wouldn't tell you when Josh's birthday is until it's passed. Sorry I promised him, I will tell you later as well as why haha",171,35,20:35:24
Ben Fickes,Dang that's amazing! Also cool that your coworker's name is Lucio haha,70,12,20:34:34
Erica Yee,But I finally got it (it's literally toggling read more/read less lol),70,12,20:33:29
Erica Yee,"Work was good. Spent all afternoon implementing this small feature that was very confusing because the whole project is in react, which neither Lucio or I really know (Evan the react guy is on vacay)",199,35,20:33:03
Erica Yee,When's his bday,15,3,20:31:57
Erica Yee,Nice,4,1,20:31:55
Ben Fickes,How was work and how is your foot?,34,8,20:25:52
Ben Fickes,"So I just wanted feedback that wasn't ""why are there weird lines""",65,12,20:25:42
Ben Fickes,I'm photoshopping something for Josh's bday and I had to remove a watermark haha,80,14,20:25:26
Ben Fickes,Awesome that's all I need to hear,33,7,20:25:10
Erica Yee,Petals?,7,1,20:23:21
Ben Fickes,I know itâs a weird question but I will explain when you answer,65,13,20:20:34
Ben Fickes,Can you tell me what you think of this image,44,10,20:20:14
Ben Fickes,I like it. Iâm imagining a Capulet/Montague situation where thereâs rival houses controlling each food truck,112,16,20:19:09
Erica Yee,And the article didn't say so I'm gonna assume they met when their parents sent them to spy on the rival food trucks (Occam's razor),132,25,20:12:21
Erica Yee,You're welcome,14,2,20:10:42
Ben Fickes,How did they meet,17,4,18:40:31
Ben Fickes,Looking back I really appreciate the number of exclamation points you gave MARRIED,82,13,18:40:19
Erica Yee,This could be the happiest Oakland book ever (most books set here are depressing),81,14,18:25:58
Erica Yee,To both,7,2,18:25:31
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,18:25:29
Ben Fickes,Jk haha that really is cool! I await your novel haha,52,11,17:58:38
Ben Fickes,And wow thatâs crazy! Canât believe taco trucks are getting married,71,11,17:58:23
Ben Fickes,I hope you donât follow in your moms footsteps (no pun intended),66,12,17:58:09
Erica Yee,I smell book/movie plot,23,4,16:40:25
Erica Yee,"Omg. We passed by this taco restaurant yesterday that I never seen before, but remembered seeing it on the forthcoming top 100 list. Just looked it up and it was founded by children of two of the most popular taco trucks in Oakland who MARRIED!!!!!!!",250,45,16:40:18
Erica Yee,This week is basically all working on the the top 100 restaurants project,73,13,16:12:34
Erica Yee,My mom has actually broken (not even sprained) her foot 3 times yikes,69,13,16:08:44

Ben Fickes,Flashback to when you twisted it on the ice haha,48,10,15:52:02
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Iâm so sorry to hear that. Hope it feels better and you can rest it,84,18,15:51:49
Erica Yee,Oh well,7,2,14:36:46
Erica Yee,I tripped and fell on the street on the way to work and my foot hurts,69,16,14:36:45

Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,14:31:28
Erica Yee,Omg nooo,8,2,12:05:35
Ben Fickes,Remember the huge feature? Itâs breaking again today. And I was told that I might have to change all of it because someone changed their mind...,146,26,12:02:50
Erica Yee,Indeed haha,11,2,11:04:29
Ben Fickes,I was not awake but time with my family was good! Iâll see them in two weeks again haha. And wow we read Acts 2 in church yesterday (but I guess it is around Pentecost time so now that I think about it itâs not that surprising),231,47,6:33:23
Erica Yee,Interesting whenever you have time https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html,122,6,1:12:41

Erica Yee,Dinner is definitely not going to be ready by 530 because we're not even home yet lol,85,17,19:53:55
Erica Yee,Wow it took us almost 2 hours to walk around the lake,53,12,19:53:36

Ben Fickes,Was seeing if that worked but alas,34,7,19:21:21

Ben Fickes,I was also incredibly impressed haha,36,6,19:21:02
Erica Yee,"Ok looking at my words of affirmation as you so graciously put it, I don't even know how to superscripts. I'm impressed",119,22,19:09:01
Erica Yee,The auntie that I talked to last night who knows her texted my mom I think when she realized her mistake haha,109,22,19:07:41
Erica Yee,I never talked to her,21,5,19:07:07
Ben Fickes,And thatâs also hilarious ð who put you two in contact?,60,11,18:15:54
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð love the code, am appreciative of the words of affirmation ð",73,13,18:15:38

Erica Yee,Oh and my grandparents are coming over for dinner which I'm supposed to cook so we'll see how that goes,103,20,17:42:52
Erica Yee,It was the first gif when I opened the keyboard so I accidentally pressed it,76,15,17:40:13
Ben Fickes,How did the aliens get there haha,33,7,17:38:16
Ben Fickes,Maybe your dad is a robot charging himself,42,8,17:38:07
Erica Yee,Ignore the aliens pls,21,4,17:36:49
Erica Yee,Or maybe he just likes to feel the power of the electricity flowing through him,79,15,17:36:01
Erica Yee,WOW my dad just went to charge the bolt even though I offered. Guess I am not trusted,85,18,17:35:43
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,17:26:55
Ben Fickes,"No, she said âif it looks irresistible Iâll playâ and did not. She did fall asleep though haha",100,18,17:26:25
Ben Fickes,I know it took us like an hour to set up haha,45,12,17:26:03
Erica Yee,Did your mom not want to play haha,34,8,17:25:03
Erica Yee,Good job!,9,2,17:24:53
Erica Yee,Oh wow so many pieces,21,5,17:24:38
Ben Fickes,I saved the snap haha,21,5,17:23:29
Ben Fickes,"Ah Iâm really sorry. Itâs called eldritch horror, I borrowed it from work a couple weeks ago. Very long but a lot of fun. One of Joshs characters died in the last turn which is sad haha but we still won",206,41,17:23:17
Erica Yee,What game is it?,16,4,17:21:32
Erica Yee,I don't think i got a snap ð®ð®,35,8,17:21:29
Erica Yee,Various little things that she took very negatively.,52,8,17:21:16
Ben Fickes,Weâre each pretending to be two people because itâs cooperative and up to 8 people haha,91,16,17:17:51
Ben Fickes,"Oh no did something happen? And yep, Josh and I are about to finish the game I snapped you, itâs been like 3 hours haha",121,25,17:17:12
Erica Yee,Is your family still in Boston?,31,6,17:05:50
Erica Yee,My dad wants us to have a family walk around the lake but Julia is in a super bad mood so probably not gonna go well,116,26,17:05:38
Ben Fickes,Are you doing anything else for Fatherâs Day?,47,8,16:53:57
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha wow that is quite the arc. At least you did try haha,72,16,16:53:48
Erica Yee,I thought I'd charge the bolt as a small Father's day gift (there's a free station 10 min walk from our house). But when I got there and parked I didn't realize you needed a card/account which was too much work so just drove back. Got home and Julia told me the card is actually in the car. So I went back to try to charge it again but then the space was full so I had to come back again again ð­ð­ oh well I tried,418,87,15:26:45
Erica Yee,"And I did remember what you were referring to earlier! (How do you remember my dreams better than me lol). Yes it was a Japanese soccer player, but he was a high schooler (and that's how i think of him) so it didn't register cuz I was thinking of professional players haha",272,52,15:22:51
Erica Yee,LOL wow you have so much detail,31,7,15:15:10
Ben Fickes,"The other is much less exciting, there were aliens attacking (or not attacking but causing collateral damage?) to just Demiurge. I and a whole bunch of other people started running toward demiurge to help. Then I said âdo you think we need weapons or anything?â And someone else said, âno, thereâs no time for that.â And there was a spaceship (controlled by humans) attacking a city but the city had a forcefield. And thatâs all I can remember from that one haha",474,82,12:12:36
Ben Fickes,"Okay so my dream (there were either two dreams or two unrelated pieces):
1. I was playing a video game in the dream with a bunch of IV people. In the game we were in a garden and there were a bunch of robot dog enemies we were fighting (they looked like Jimmy Neutronâs robot dog with a siren on its head). We found a treasure chest and examined it and got a message that said âdo you want to fix the module with scrap parts?â We said yes. Then we moved on and found a Shy Guy who we talked to. He said the robots were âonly designed to bark once, not over and over. Theyâre for defense, not attack!â And asked us to repair the module. We did already so we talked to him again. He said âEven though youâve fixed the module, the robot dogs are still malfunctioning. The only way you can fix it is to be extremely rude to it. Here is a list, from most to least, of words it finds insulting.â Then there were twelve pages of words that started off being normal negatively connoted adjectives but soon were random nouns and eventually were whole paragraphs of text and things like âccccccccccccâ. I tried to write them all down but other people skipped through the list so I only wrote down three words. Then we went back to the module and examined it and it made us choose from a list of four words over and over with the words being different each time. And I either woke up or left the people playing the game in my dream",1442,276,12:10:44
Ben Fickes,Ttyl!,5,1,11:47:57
Erica Yee,Wait I gotta drive tttl,23,5,11:47:44
Ben Fickes,Wasnât it a soccer player from or in Japan? Sorry if Iâm misremembering,75,13,11:47:12
Ben Fickes,Wait am I misremembering? Isnât that the one you had the romance plot idea based on?,86,16,11:46:56
Erica Yee,?? Don't remember,17,3,11:46:35
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð thatâs quite the dream. It could be combined with the plot of your other dream about the Japanese soccer player haha,128,23,11:46:09
Erica Yee,"I dreamt I was on the US women's soccer team and we were playing Japan in the world cup. One of the Japanese players got injured and I somehow became friends with her. But at the same time, the US team was also spies because the world cup took place in some middle eastern country. For some reason we had to go undercover as flight attendants after the game (even though our faces are well known??). I was struggling to hand out drinks and then another attendant got suspicious of us and then I woke up lol",506,97,11:30:17
Erica Yee,"Not the family news, I'll tell you next time we talk",52,11,11:29:15
Erica Yee,Jade Zhang I think,18,4,11:29:03
Ben Fickes,"Also, did you say you had a dream to tell about? I had a pretty funny one last night but I donât think I have time now to tell it before church",145,32,8:19:29
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Whatâs her name? And was that a the family news or did you have other family news?,93,19,8:18:58
Erica Yee,One of my parents' old friends knows a girl who's going to be a freshman at northeastern in the fall and gave her my number. Violin and physics lol. She sings too so imma try to recruit her for IV worship,204,41,2:22:54
Erica Yee,Finally home (11:20pm). Not excessively late,44,6,2:21:22
Erica Yee,Hi to her and Josh too! Gnight,30,7,0:18:00
Erica Yee,I enhanced her and then I was like where'd she go I wanna use her,65,15,0:17:53
Ben Fickes,"And Iâm going to bed now haha, goodnight!",43,8,0:16:09
Ben Fickes,My mom saw I was messaging you and said to tell you hi,54,13,0:15:57
Ben Fickes,Fwiw though I really like gum and sheâs on my arena team,58,12,0:15:46
Ben Fickes,No problem haha,15,3,0:15:29
Erica Yee,Ohhh ok thanks haha,19,4,0:15:12
Ben Fickes,Youâll probably unlock it soon if you got gum,47,9,0:14:40
Ben Fickes,Oh itâs the purple energy version of campaign haha,52,9,0:14:30
Ben Fickes,Very sad because there are basically no good green campaign heroes,66,11,0:14:18
Erica Yee,What is beyondering,19,3,0:14:17
Ben Fickes,So Gum is beyondering but not campaign,38,7,0:14:05
Ben Fickes,And only certain ones tagged âbeyonderingâ in beyondering,61,8,0:13:57
Ben Fickes,You can only use certain heroes tagged âcampaignâ in campaign,65,10,0:13:38
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs super annoying,26,4,0:13:24
Erica Yee,Like gum,8,2,0:07:17
Erica Yee,Why can't I use some heroes in campaign,39,8,0:07:13
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. And nice glad you can chill together haha,49,9,22:58:07
Erica Yee,It's been alright though. Talked to a bunch of people and now my dad and I are chilling in a corner lol,103,22,22:29:00
Erica Yee,We didn't even have time to have our family party in between the two big ones because we had to redecorate and set up,117,24,22:26:32
Erica Yee,Can't tonight but maybe sometime the next few days,50,9,22:25:52
Ben Fickes,And know youâre busy but howâs your day been so far?,56,11,21:48:49
Ben Fickes,Like as if you were watching it together? Thatâs a good idea haha. Are you going to?,86,17,21:48:39
Erica Yee,Katie asked if I wanted to watch a movie tonight at the same time and text during LOL,85,18,21:41:18

Ben Fickes,Sorry just needed to rant haha,30,6,15:11:22
Ben Fickes,My familyâs been waiting at pas Thai cafe for the past hour,61,12,15:11:16
Ben Fickes,"Iâve spent the past hour and a half on the t, the green line is having crazy issues. So now Iâm taking red to orange to mass ave ugh",136,29,15:10:56

Ben Fickes,Sure! No pressure though if you end up being not free,53,11,21:01:23
Erica Yee,Just got home from work and gotta help prep for small group dinner but should be free around 8 my time?,103,21,21:00:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah he only had one drink he said,34,8,20:22:43
Erica Yee,Not sure whether it's a sign of returning to his escape-to-europe ways or a healthy and mature ability to do things in moderation or neither,140,25,20:19:34
Erica Yee,Oh that's good,14,3,20:18:15
Ben Fickes,By the pru haha. We were gonna cook and then went to chipotle instead haha. And yeah he talked about it a lot but to me he seemed pretty fine honestly,150,31,20:17:14
Erica Yee,"He messaged me ""I'm going to break my alcohol fast"" earlier which I didn't see till now but guess it was before your meetup",123,24,20:14:35
Erica Yee,Where even is the closest Chipotle lol,38,7,20:14:11
Ben Fickes,"Meeting with Victor was good. We talked a bit, he seemed pretty happy. He officially filled out the paperwork to graduate? Anyways couple other things but Iâll tell you when we talk",183,32,20:01:00
Ben Fickes,So confused again,17,3,18:25:22
Ben Fickes,Wow thatâs awesome! Glad you get to see that stuff. And glad you get a slow bit after how busy it sounds like things have been,128,26,17:39:28

Erica Yee,Listening to an aletheia podcast about dealing with mental health issues in the church. Reminding me of Victor,110,18,12:46:42
Erica Yee,Np,2,1,12:44:03
Ben Fickes,Put your name on every story,28,6,12:40:49
Ben Fickes,And wow itâs your company now haha,36,7,12:40:34
Ben Fickes,"So on the Bible thing, I have thoughts vaguely floating in my head but canât verbalize them now",97,18,12:40:27
Erica Yee,So I'm the only one here uh oh,30,8,12:35:51
Erica Yee,Omg one supervisor is on vacay and the other is working from home but might have to go to the doctor because of an allergic reaction,132,26,12:35:40
Erica Yee,Sometimes I feel like it's disingenuous to pray when I'm not feeling clear minded even though I know in my head that God wants any and all versions of me,153,30,12:15:20
Erica Yee,Ah yeah I've been missing that too,34,7,12:14:12
Ben Fickes,Iâve been getting back on journaling but not having enough Bible time,71,12,12:06:06
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,12:05:30
Erica Yee,Not really. Haven't been praying as much which I need to do,59,12,12:05:17
Ben Fickes,My friend from high school is gonna be in Boston tomorrow so Iâm gonna get lunch with him. And my mom and Josh are gonna come up tomorrow too,143,29,12:03:18
Ben Fickes,"I gotcha. Anything on your mind? And dang thatâs bad (the injury). Wow enjoy the rain, weâve been having a lot haha",119,22,12:02:40
Erica Yee,It's sprinkling here lol,24,4,11:46:47

Erica Yee,I cannot get a good night's sleep ugh. Still new job + work stress + not exercising as much I guess,99,21,11:19:03

Erica Yee,So now apparently I'm planning something,40,6,20:48:40
Erica Yee,My mom says we should do something for Father's day since we didn't try very hard for his birthday,98,19,20:48:29
Ben Fickes,If Sunday doesnât work I can try for Friday after Victor and I are done since I can stay up later,99,21,20:43:55
Ben Fickes,Oooh thatâs right,19,3,20:43:36
Erica Yee,Oh ok so Sunday is our only hope,32,8,20:43:26
Erica Yee,Since it's the party trifecta,29,5,20:43:19
Erica Yee,I can definitely not do Saturday,32,6,20:43:15
Ben Fickes,Iâm gonna be hanging out with Victor tomorrow evening so ideally not then probably,84,14,20:37:40
Ben Fickes,Oh I forgot Fatherâs Day - no problem if you canât. I might be able to do Saturday too,90,19,20:37:24
Erica Yee,"Oh but either way it's gonna be late for you after I eat dinner Friday, so Sunday would probably be better anyway",113,22,20:34:26
Erica Yee,Also may be free Friday night? Trying to get an intern dinner together but idk if that's gonna happen,101,19,20:34:02
Erica Yee,Should be free,14,3,20:33:42
Erica Yee,Hmm lemme ask my mom soon if we're doing anything Sunday,56,11,20:33:32
Ben Fickes,Oh you can tell me later but do you know when you wanna game? And would you by any chance be free Sunday night to talk?,119,26,20:31:09
Ben Fickes,No problem haha,15,3,20:30:47
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,20:30:22
Erica Yee,Oh maybe I should pay attention ok,34,7,20:30:19
Ben Fickes,So how many turns itâll be before they attack next,52,10,20:30:13
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs the countdown for their attacks,43,7,20:30:04
Erica Yee,Why do they change,18,4,20:29:48
Erica Yee,What do the numbers next to enemy health bars mean,50,10,20:29:45
Erica Yee,Ah you got it haha,18,5,20:29:29
Ben Fickes,And you never know haha,23,5,20:29:28
Ben Fickes,Good but the thing Iâm working on gets more and more complicated haha. I feel like my manager still thinks easy stuff is tough for me but oh well,147,29,20:28:18
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs the worst. And nice! You deserve it, I know how hard youâre working",81,15,20:25:11
Erica Yee,How was your day,16,4,20:22:42
Erica Yee,Now time to watch the warriors lose in their last game in Oakland,65,13,20:22:39
Erica Yee,There's a kudos slack channel and I got a shout-out for working on the project so yay,85,17,20:22:05
Erica Yee,"Yah I guess, idk",16,4,20:21:30
Erica Yee,Supervisor and I were kind of scrambling bc the other dev went on vacation starting today but he made the components we had to tweak,132,25,20:20:56
Ben Fickes,What happened with the story? And tired from lack of sleep?,59,11,20:20:07
Erica Yee,Whole morning was troubleshooting the retail vacancies story that went out,74,11,20:19:39
Erica Yee,Not really because of work but doesn't help haha,48,9,20:19:14
Erica Yee,I'm so tired,12,3,20:18:57
Ben Fickes,"Not to distract you from that amazing game youâre playing, but how was work?",78,14,20:18:33
Ben Fickes,Haha ð you would also be a real commuter if you read,55,12,20:18:19
Erica Yee,I'm too braindead to read on the ride home today so playing your game and I feel like a real commuter haha,106,22,20:17:08
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,12:28:09
Ben Fickes,"And honestly Iâm not good enough to know which characters are actually good (plus thereâs a lot I donât have). But Iâll tell you about it when we talk, it was actually significantly affecting the profit of certain sales, and so even though the nerf was phrased as if it were from gameplay interest (and to an extent, it is) it was primarily for financial reasons",370,66,12:26:44
Ben Fickes,Haha Iâd be happy to if it doesnât mess up the schedule,59,12,12:25:05
Erica Yee,Did you think they needed nerfing?,34,6,12:18:34
Erica Yee,Oh yikes,8,2,12:18:28
Erica Yee,My mom told her she could you meet you when you visit....not sure how that'll fit in but ok,91,19,12:18:01
Ben Fickes,"Sorry for all these messages at once but there was a big nerf yesterday/today and people online who were affected are pretty upset. Two characters, Big the Cat and Joe Musashi, were the two main hits. My manager was very upset because he uses Big. The engineering manager of MPQ cane over to our side of the office, said âMy husband is mad you killed his cat,â and then walked back to his side without saying anything else haha",431,79,12:09:22

Erica Yee,Oh dang Erica,13,3,11:11:54
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm so after Israel you mentioned something about our long distance being different than you expected but you hadnât really had time to think about it because you were rushing around a lot. Anyways just curious if you had more thoughts, itâs fine if you donât",266,46,11:05:11
Erica Yee,"And I don't get your second question, what do you mean?",55,11,10:52:42
Erica Yee,Oh yeah,7,2,10:52:23
Ben Fickes,"A couple things:
1. I remembered the thing I forgot to tell you about - the abortion convo John, Shem, and I had
2. Very random thought, but do you have any thoughts about our time long distance so far? Was gonna ask you when we talk next (I forgot last time) so we can always talk then but figured Iâd ask now so you have time to think if you would like it",359,74,7:55:08
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,22:19:31
Erica Yee,(to both xD),12,3,22:16:46

Ben Fickes,Heading back from Dannyâs. He leaves for CA Saturday!,55,9,21:49:58

Erica Yee,And good thing you're now proficient at zapping bugs,52,9,21:20:01
Erica Yee,..if those make sense lol,25,5,21:18:12
Erica Yee,Second was the style sheet for this tool I'm improving would not update on my local server and I finally figured out after much frustration that it was getting cached (only a problem when served with python not node which is why I was confused),244,45,21:18:04
Erica Yee,"First was I'm working on a mini fire tracker widget that pulls in data from a Google sheets. Some fires are marked as ""major"" but they won't necessarily be on top of the list. So I added some (pretty fficient, I think) logic to the widget to display 4 fires, prioritizing major fires if applicable no matter where they are on the sheets",336,63,21:16:42
Erica Yee,Ohh gotcha,10,2,21:14:41
Ben Fickes,I did a ton of stuff for my big issue so I feel proud but may have discovered a latent bug haha,95,22,20:54:34
Ben Fickes,And thatâs awesome! Congrats! I know theyâre probably specific but what are they?,85,13,20:54:14
Ben Fickes,Long story but basically this other guy was really enthusiastic about what was going on and I didnât want to let him down by leaving haha,139,26,20:53:56
Erica Yee,Just wanted to share that I figured out the two problems I was stuck on yesterday and I feel so proud haha,106,22,20:27:15

Ben Fickes,Just getting out of work now,28,6,18:59:26
Erica Yee,Lololol,7,1,12:17:14

Ben Fickes,I think we might be cooking,27,6,12:03:17

Erica Yee,Ohh ok,6,2,11:33:36
Ben Fickes,I hope heâs not actually skipping going to dc but thatâs out of my hands,76,15,11:32:34

Ben Fickes,Mostly about the BCEC lack of response,38,7,21:25:14
Ben Fickes,Sorry know youâre watching the game but wanted to share,57,10,21:24:56
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:24:41

Erica Yee,Did you guys figure it out?,27,6,20:58:34
Erica Yee,Aw yay! I'm glad,16,4,20:58:14
Ben Fickes,Long story but at work I worked on something really hard and got stuck and asked for help. My manager sometimes mentions things that I think are implying I should ask for help less (but I donât a ton and most times itâs stuff about the projects I have no way of knowing). Anyways today I was extra ready and he recognizes my struggle as an actual one haha,359,69,20:55:52
Erica Yee,Ooh interesting,15,2,20:53:21

Erica Yee,Oh did I? Sorry mb,18,5,20:41:52
Ben Fickes,I remember you telling me about that on the phone. I think prioritizing people over the game makes you a good person not a bad fan haha,135,27,20:41:31
Erica Yee,"I'm honestly ok if this is the end of this dynasty, especially since they're moving to SF lol. Probably makes me a bad fan, but it was so fun and a joyful unifier when they first started winning again in 2015 that I want other fan bases to experience that too. Like this would be the raptors' first championship ever",316,60,20:39:58
Erica Yee,Oh yeah the rail system,23,5,20:38:18

Ben Fickes,Wow thanks for reading,22,4,6:43:27
Ben Fickes,"So my family went to Pennsylvania and for some reason they were staying at a lake house but I was staying at a hotel. Then there was a âdanceâ for all the children staying at the hotel that I got a ride to. And I invited you but you couldnât come (being in California haha). But it was outside and there were fireworks and the only thing I remember from that part was some guy started playing the violin as the fireworks started and everyone went crazy at the coincidence. Then at the end I offered several people a ride to the hotel. But alas, I remembered at the end I had gotten a ride there and had no car. So I called my parents (they were both in the dream) and asked for them to bring the car. And I was very embarrassed at offering a ride without a car but eventually they brought it. Afterwards, my mom saw how embarrassed I was and called you and said, âErica, Ben is sad. You need to come over here.â So you suddenly appeared (of course) but your hand was in a cast because it was burned and you had severe sunburn haha. Anyways I was trying to hold your hand but couldnât because of the cast (why did I try if you very clearly had a cast? I donât know) so I held your wrist instead haha. Then my family and you were at a movie theater and there was popcorn labeled âfemaleâ that you and my mom got and âmaleâ that Josh and I got. And thatâs the end haha",1389,271,6:43:17
Ben Fickes,I had a dream last night you were in. Itâs a lot to type out but Iâm gonna forget if I donât type it out now so here goes,127,29,6:32:52

Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Wow good for you those do sound like big issues haha,61,13,20:46:17
Erica Yee,"It's a timeline. Two of the images were the same and the other one is harder to explain but basically the reporter wrote ""1990s"" but the generator can only parse specific dates or months so it messed up the order",212,40,20:43:27
Ben Fickes,Oh congrats!!! This might be too nosy haha but what were the errors,67,13,20:41:45
Erica Yee,Ok so I feel better now about my name being on that project because I caught 2 pretty bad errors just now and we fixed them before it publishes Monday 4am haha,159,32,20:28:54
Ben Fickes,Dang that sounds really amazing. Itâs cool youâll be making something so widely used,88,14,18:27:17

Erica Yee,I shared a video I've been using as a placeholder for a project because it's an animated llama or snake or something singing haha,129,24,20:50:47

Ben Fickes,"On the Pivotal stuff, dang. They talked a lot about kubernetes while I was there and I know they were trying to figure out a way to deal with it. But dang I guess they got hit pretty bad",186,39,12:06:22

Erica Yee,"I wonder what he thinks of bcec since he wasn't around a lot of Asians growing up, let alone Asian Christians",109,21,10:53:23
Erica Yee,"He later said he was ""sorta"" exaggerating but obviously he's thinking about it",78,13,10:52:50
Ben Fickes,My original thoughts were that this combined with BCEC might lead to him switching churches which maybe could help. But now idk Iâm sorry and this seems much worse,165,29,8:09:26
Ben Fickes,So was about to tell you my Victor thoughts but I re read the message and I guess I missed the âso I can quit Christianityâ part,132,27,8:08:41
Ben Fickes,I havenât either haha I was pretty quiet during the lunch discussion ð,75,13,6:33:08
Erica Yee,I've never heard of that lol but ð,37,8,22:58:39
Ben Fickes,Like âwhat sounds better? Ben and Erica or Erica and Ben?â But with every couple of every person at lunch,109,20,22:54:27
Erica Yee,You too,7,2,22:48:01
Erica Yee,And nice!!,10,2,22:47:59
Erica Yee,What do you mean orders,23,5,22:47:34
Ben Fickes,"Anyways I hope you get good sleep tonight, enjoy the game, and have a good day tomorrow",87,17,22:46:40
Ben Fickes,"Oh two stories from today before bed:
1. A few of my coworkers know about you because they were talking about how orders in couple names sound haha
2. My manager was explaining something me and Tim said âwe should hire Ben after he graduates.â So I guess hopefully they like me haha",286,53,22:46:22
Erica Yee,Yep ð¬,8,2,22:34:50
Ben Fickes,Oh dang thatâs still a super small team though,48,9,22:28:37
Erica Yee,By the end of the summer two more full-time are joining tho (so the team is doubling and there's literally no more desks lol),125,24,22:27:11
Erica Yee,"2 other full-time people, and one's going to Iceland for 2 weeks after tomorrow",79,14,22:26:30
Ben Fickes,Yeah I get that. How bigs your team again?,42,9,22:23:30
Erica Yee,Mostly cuz the work is so hard haha. Also there's always gonna be stuff to do,77,16,22:21:26
Erica Yee,I actually feel like the workdays go by faster than my previous internships,75,13,22:20:15
Erica Yee,Yeah thanks,11,2,22:19:40
Ben Fickes,Ah. Well of course Iâm biased but Iâm sure you just need to give yourself time,82,16,22:18:35
Erica Yee,Cuz they programmed a lot of tools that help make our workflow efficient,72,13,22:13:25
Ben Fickes,What are you able to compare yourself to with them three days in?,65,13,22:06:30
Erica Yee,It's hard not to compare myself to previous interns cuz they had way more previous development experience,105,17,22:02:46
Erica Yee,I'm really not xD but learning a ton,36,8,22:02:00
Ben Fickes,And thanks :),13,3,21:53:22
Ben Fickes,Nah Iâm sure youâre doing great,35,6,21:53:18
Erica Yee,And yay,7,2,21:53:05
Erica Yee,Good job getting it done!,25,5,21:52:42
Erica Yee,I don't know what I'm doing lol,31,7,21:52:28
Ben Fickes,My day was good. Had something I forgot about Monday (oops) but got it done real fast which was good. Dnd has been fun haha,123,25,21:39:01
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang Iâm sorry to hear that. Anything on your mind? And glad it went well, what made it challenging?",105,20,21:38:20
Erica Yee,How was your day,16,4,21:14:15
Erica Yee,Work was very challenging but slightly productive so yay,56,9,21:14:07
Erica Yee,Very tired. Didn't sleep well last night. Think I might fall asleep during the game lol,87,16,21:13:46
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. How are you doing today?,37,7,21:09:21
Erica Yee,Wow I'm impressed,17,3,20:20:17
Ben Fickes,Josh sent me this,17,4,18:41:08
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,14:31:19
Ben Fickes,Going to a sit down Korean place with a few coworkers for lunch,63,13,12:11:14
Ben Fickes,"Haha if I could thereâs stuff I would snap you haha. And yep, SFO!",68,14,12:05:36
Erica Yee,SFO?,4,1,11:39:20
Erica Yee,And ok,6,2,11:39:11
Erica Yee,"And no worries, I hope you don't feel the need to snap just because I do (no one told me a phone policy so ð¤·) ((Julia won't even ask for the WiFi password at her work because she said there's a strict phone policy so rip our data plan lol))",243,50,11:38:57
Erica Yee,Ooh yay! I'm excited to read it,31,7,11:37:01
Ben Fickes,Think my flight on Sunday is at 12:16,37,8,9:06:52
Ben Fickes,Had a couple thoughts on Victor while running. No time to share now but this is a reminder for me for later haha,112,23,8:20:44
Ben Fickes,"I remember two random things I forgot to tell you:
1. I âfinishedâ reviving water a couple days ago! Wanna rewrite a little bit of it before I send it to you because there are a couple super rough parts
2. I have not sent you snaps from work (with a couple exceptions) because I think technically Iâm not allowed to take pictures of anything in the office according to my NDA",381,72,6:35:57
Ben Fickes,Whoah thank you for sharing all that about the concert! That is cool and I love the pic. And yeah sigh is right about Victor...,127,25,6:33:31
Erica Yee,Sigg,4,1,0:09:20
Erica Yee,Also forgot to tell you coolest thing about the concert: you know how at Christian concerts they always do a message to ask people to sponsor compassion or world vision kids? Apparently the bassist last night is from Korea and her father was sponsored by someone through compassion!!! So cool,292,50,0:02:28
Erica Yee,Oh Victor also said he was glad he went so yay,46,11,23:37:03
Erica Yee,Cool pic from the concert I don't think I snapped,49,10,23:33:58
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing,15,3,22:01:07
Erica Yee,ð ok can I call,18,5,22:00:53
Ben Fickes,Your bladder truly is your weakness,35,6,21:58:16
Erica Yee,Peeing then ready,17,3,21:57:36
Ben Fickes,Yeah take your time!,20,4,21:47:34
Erica Yee,Sorry 10 mins?,14,3,21:46:21
Ben Fickes,Talk to you soon! Take your time though please,46,9,21:11:30
Erica Yee,"Ok time to eat fast, talk to you soon",37,9,21:11:15
Ben Fickes,"Ah I gotcha. Well I really appreciate it, thank you Erica :) really really this means a lot. Thank you",102,20,21:10:22
Erica Yee,"No, but I had to get home before I knew which is why I couldn't ask earlier",75,17,21:09:40
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure! Iâm not interrupting your evening though right?,64,10,21:07:57
Erica Yee,Ok can you do 945 your time tn?,31,8,21:07:25
Ben Fickes,But please donât let this create pressure on you,50,9,20:58:30
Ben Fickes,"I know it is. But my thoughts are that if I stay up, say, an hour later to talk to you and sleep in an extra hour, then Iâm not losing sleep (itâs really losing run time, which is okay as long as itâs not all the time). I just like talking to you haha",257,55,20:58:19
Erica Yee,I was soo exhausted today after the Hillsong concert even though we left early lol. Not that you're me but I think sleep is important,133,25,20:57:07
Erica Yee,noo I don't want you to stay up,31,8,20:55:28
Erica Yee,Yes ik I'm sorry ð¢,21,5,20:55:18
Ben Fickes,Hmmm well if it helps at all I can probably stay up later and do a short run the next day (just not every night) if that makes a difference,139,30,20:55:11
Ben Fickes,"I have dnd but if you wanna talk I can (I told my mom and Josh), unless youâre not free. And hmmm that stinks haha",116,25,20:53:07
Erica Yee,I want to figure out a regular time but by the time I eat dinner on weekdays and shower it's usually too late ahh,113,24,20:48:39
Erica Yee,D&d lol,7,2,20:47:41
Erica Yee,Do you have and today,21,5,20:47:40
Erica Yee,Ohhh,4,1,20:47:39
Ben Fickes,But if you canât thatâs fine,32,6,20:43:59
Ben Fickes,I can do other times regularly,30,6,20:43:55
Ben Fickes,Oh for plan regularly I meant only for Tuesdayâs sorry haha,61,11,20:43:49
Ben Fickes,Okay so usually 10:30-11. I would be willing to stay up later though if necessary haha,86,16,20:43:30
Erica Yee,What time do you usually sleep,30,6,20:43:02
Erica Yee,But ðð,12,2,20:42:55
Erica Yee,"I was asking for calling, because I realize I also cannot plan regularly haha",77,14,20:42:41
Ben Fickes,If you werenât asking for calling sorry haha but thatâs my schedule,71,12,20:37:51
Ben Fickes,"Oh gotcha haha. I have dnd Wednesdayâs, Thursdayâs I have game night (but if youâre asking for calling, Iâm usually home between 8 and 9 if I go). I have dnd with family Tuesdays. I would say for that Iâm flexible on a week to week basis but would not want to plan regularly then if that makes sense",309,59,20:37:40
Erica Yee,"Remind me of your weekly schedule again? d&d with your family when? D&d with friends on wed, work game night Thurs, ??",118,22,20:35:49
Erica Yee,But they didn't take the photos yet so not soon I don't think lol,65,14,20:35:06
Erica Yee,Idk actually,12,2,20:34:58
Ben Fickes,I gotcha. Well please let me know how your thoughts are developing haha (though Iâm sure Iâll ask haha). When is this project due (if you have a deadline),158,29,20:29:07
Erica Yee,And it's not mutually exclusive at all newsrooms,48,8,20:26:51
Erica Yee,"You're not wrong cuz I don't know yet haha. That's why I wanted to do this internship, to see",93,19,20:26:31
Ben Fickes,Whoah that is so cool! And gotcha. Thatâs more what youâre into right? Or am I wrong haha,93,18,20:25:32
Erica Yee,"And we don't do any of the reporting or taking pictures, just putting it all together on the web",96,19,20:24:31
Erica Yee,Yep I made the grid today via iterating through json data that the system pipes from a Google sheets (SO COOL),110,21,20:23:52
Ben Fickes,Whoah I canât wait to see it when itâs done. Have you started the programming? And are you going to go to the neighborhood for research? Or will it just be looking stuff up?,177,34,20:22:04
Erica Yee,And I'm making this opening graphic of photos of the storefronts fading in and out in a grid,92,18,20:20:33
Erica Yee,Story about epidemic of retail vacancies in an SF neighborhood,62,10,20:20:02
Ben Fickes,I know youâre still typing but that is amazing!!! Whatâs the project?,73,12,20:17:14
Erica Yee,Also had lunch with the marketing intern which was fun,54,10,20:17:04
Erica Yee,Way earlier than I thought this would happen lol,48,9,20:16:48
Erica Yee,I got assigned today a real project that's all mine ð®,56,11,20:16:39
Erica Yee,Ooh yeah thanks for sharing,27,5,20:15:01
Ben Fickes,Just wanted to share - I think this is probably a good sign,59,13,18:50:29
Erica Yee,Nah you're not disrupting. And thanks you too,45,8,10:56:03
Ben Fickes,And I hope you have another great day at work!,46,10,7:49:35
Ben Fickes,"Thanks Erica. I feel bad for wanting to talk so badly because I know you have a ton of stuff going on, and I definitely donât want to disrupt it. But I appreciate it",167,34,6:57:26
Erica Yee,Thanks for communicating. Sorry I've been so unresponsive today and yesterday. But I will def let you know when the soonest I can talk because I do want to prioritize our relationship and listening to you,204,36,23:14:50
Ben Fickes,"Okay so this is gonna seem really out of the blue, but yesterday I talked with Jason about something and it actually really bothered me and has been on my mind since then. I really wanted to be able to talk with you about it but I didnât want to interrupt your day and I know you had a lot going on, and since I already asked to talk I didnât want to worry you or bother you now. But I talked to John about it tonight and he reminded me about the importance of communication in a relationship. So, I am communicating it haha. Itâs not anything urgent, and I donât want it to interrupt anything going on for you so please please please donât let it do that, but yeah just wanted to tell you I have something on my mind for whenever you have the time. Anyways, glad your first day was good and I hope the concert is amazing! Hope you sleep well and have another great day tomorrow :)",891,174,22:56:16
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang guess it really is crowded there. No worries haha, no rush at all. I'm just excited to hear about it haha",113,23,20:41:32
Erica Yee,And now taking another train,28,5,20:41:00
Erica Yee,Sorry I couldn't text on bart (train) bc it was so packed literally my body from shoulders down were pressed against others lol,127,23,20:40:56
Ben Fickes,I know I can hear about it another time but Iâm very curious haha,67,14,20:32:36
Ben Fickes,Oh have fun! And Iâm glad it was good! How are the people (or your first impressions of them)? Any significant stories?,121,22,20:32:23
Erica Yee,"But first day was good! I almost derailed everything by requesting a PC when the hr person asked me last week, because the team only knows how to set up the dev environment on Macs lol",184,36,20:31:42
Erica Yee,Suddenly going to Hillsong concert tonight cuz our friend got us free suite tickets to Oracle (where the warriors play),119,20,20:30:44
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,10:33:23
Ben Fickes,"And if youâre not nervous at all, well, congrats and still hope it goes well haha",83,16,7:56:31
Ben Fickes,"I have no idea how youâre feeling about starting work, but, if youâre nervous, these are verses that help me that I hope help you:
âBut now, this is what the Lord saysâ he who created you, Jacob, he who formed you, Israel: âDo not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.â
â­â­Isaiahâ¬ â­43:1-2â¬",560,104,7:56:06
Ben Fickes,No problemo :),14,3,22:31:06
Erica Yee,"Thank you, I really appreciate it",33,6,22:30:19
Ben Fickes,"Just in case my sleeping morning self does not remember, I hope you have an amazing first day of work tomorrow! I will be praying for you, and I would really really love to hear about it whenever you have a chance to let me know how it was/is going :)",251,51,22:26:28
Erica Yee,Aw nice :),10,3,20:18:13
Ben Fickes,Our pastor today talked about journalism briefly and it made me think of you haha,81,15,19:34:04
Ben Fickes,Okay haha I look forward to it,30,7,19:33:47
Erica Yee,Yes I have two specific pieces of evidence I can share haha,59,12,19:30:21
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well of course I have questions why but I will wait haha,67,14,19:23:17
Erica Yee,Tl;dr It was nice seeing my old teachers but I didn't really like the church,76,15,19:21:01
Erica Yee,"Ok thanks, I'll let you know!",29,6,19:18:55
Ben Fickes,"But also please please no pressure, I know work is first priority and I donât wanna stress you out",100,19,18:23:01
Ben Fickes,No worries! I know you start working tomorrow but if at some point in the evening you have time and would like to talk just let me know ð,140,29,18:19:55
Erica Yee,Still out lol,13,3,18:01:31
Erica Yee,Sorry don't think I'll have time to talk today,46,9,18:01:25
Erica Yee,Ok np,5,2,15:54:39
Ben Fickes,If thatâs good with you,25,5,13:15:40
Ben Fickes,"HAHA wow sorry to hear that. At least youâre early haha. Okay no worries, Iâm meeting with Jason at some undetermined time today and thatâs all I have. So I guess if you happen to be free lemme know and if Iâm free we can talk, if not we can wait for another time",271,54,13:15:31
Erica Yee,LOL THERE'S NO SUNDAY SCHOOL TODAY WE'RE SO EARLY,49,9,13:00:06
Erica Yee,So I might have a few hours in between or not.. I really don't want you to plan time and then I can't make it tho ..so idk sorry haha,133,30,12:31:34
Erica Yee,Then going to the gym around 4 before the warriors game,55,11,12:30:53
Erica Yee,So the church service we're going to is at 11 (well we're going to Sunday school too before it bc my friends are overchievers lol). Then I'm guessing we're gonna get lunch. But the church is kinda far from my home and I'm dependent on my friend who's driving me,261,50,12:30:23
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,12:28:00
Ben Fickes,"If youâre free to talk today (and no worries if youâre not), do you know when youâd be free?",98,19,12:26:52
Ben Fickes,I got to talk to Ty some at a picnic at church. He brought up that if I ever want to heâd be down to start a company with Michael and me haha,143,33,12:26:30
Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬ good night!,20,3,0:23:05
Ben Fickes,"Overheard:
John: âdo you wanna go to church together tomorrowâ
Shem: âthat sounds pretty gayâ
J: âdonât worry weâll be five feet apart at all timesâ
S: âI think youâre lying. I donât trust youâ

So clearly this conversation about abortion is long gone. Anyways goodnight, hopefully Iâll talk to you tomorrow but no worries if not",355,57,0:20:26
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,0:08:21
Ben Fickes,But we still had a good discussion I will tell you about,56,12,23:57:58
Ben Fickes,Our abortion discussion devolved into betting on how many eggs a woman has in her body so Iâm gonna shower now,112,21,23:57:47
Ben Fickes,Dang video games in real life,29,6,23:57:20
Erica Yee,Here's the pic of me firing away into an old surfboard,54,11,23:47:26
Erica Yee,Would like to hear about it later,33,7,23:47:21
Erica Yee,!! Wow,6,2,23:46:20
Ben Fickes,ð®ð®ð®,12,1,23:42:49
Ben Fickes,Also having a deep convo with John and Shem about abortion,58,11,23:42:35
Erica Yee,Think I'll need some more practice first heh,44,8,23:42:25
Ben Fickes,Shems going to bcec too. And oh my goodness thatâs so cool! Reminds me to never cross you ð¬ haha,101,20,23:39:52
Erica Yee,"My uncle made all those weapons, including repurposing a kitchen knife for the spear lol",88,15,23:36:24
Erica Yee,Does shem?,10,2,23:35:17
Ben Fickes,"Nah I offered, heâs going to bcec",35,7,23:33:34

Ben Fickes,And I heard from barbs today! She wanted a recipe from thanksgiving haha,72,13,23:31:08
Ben Fickes,I convinced John to commit to church tomorrow which is nice haha,64,12,23:30:52
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Lemme know how the church is please! And Iâm glad you get time with them too ð,92,19,23:30:38
Erica Yee,"It's been good. I was really tired after so much socializing earlier and the Mormon temple tour took so much waiting, but I'm glad I'm out with my friends",154,29,23:29:43
Erica Yee,Yeah they met at school and he's interning nearby for the summer,64,12,23:28:43
Erica Yee,And we're all gonna visit a church tomorrow! Where some hs teachers go including our beloved music teacher,106,18,23:28:02

Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâve been replaced. Jk haha is he friends with your friends? And how has your evening been?,99,19,23:27:19

Erica Yee,Kk I will,9,3,23:26:24
Ben Fickes,Just searched overbearing out of curiosity,42,6,23:26:19
Ben Fickes,If you donât mind being overbearing on my behalf haha,55,10,23:25:38
Ben Fickes,Hmmm maybe just next time you message him (like in a day or two) you can casually ask how it went,97,21,23:25:21
Erica Yee,Do you think I can ask him how it went or would that be overbearing,67,15,23:24:53
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,23:24:37
Ben Fickes,"I did have a lot of fun! It would seem my worries of things going badly were unfounded and in my own head (wow, who wouldâve thought?). I actually think (maybe this is just wishful) that it was especially good for Victor. He stayed even after Rayshawn and Mike left which I hope meant he was enjoying himself. I have a couple funny stories haha",346,65,23:24:15
Ben Fickes,Sorry wanted to use the suggested auto reply haha,49,9,23:22:50
Ben Fickes,Yes,3,1,23:22:40
Erica Yee,Did you have fun?,17,4,23:22:27
Erica Yee,Aww I'm glad it went well,25,6,23:22:23

Erica Yee,Oh hi,5,2,23:21:39
Erica Yee,Are people still there?,23,4,23:21:37
Ben Fickes,"Know youâre busy so no rush to reply but wanted to let you know that game night was really good. Rayshawn and Mike left early and I can explain a little more, Iâm a little worried Rayshawn didnât feel comfortable around people. But overall it was really good",264,48,23:21:33
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! I hope you have fun :),31,8,21:42:30
Erica Yee,I'm spontaneously having dinner with hs friends and one of their friends from college,85,14,21:31:06
Erica Yee,Yay!!,5,1,21:30:47
Ben Fickes,Itâs going really well so far I think! Just wanted to share haha,66,13,21:29:12

Erica Yee,I think they'll appreciate it. You're a good host,49,9,18:11:43
Ben Fickes,Honestly a little stressed and Iâll be glad when itâs done if it goes well haha. Just hope itâs fun for everyone,118,22,18:09:00

Ben Fickes,"No worries, no oneâs here yet haha. Itâs Victor, Roger, Mike, Rayshawn, Matt, and Beth. I told John and Shem theyâre invited but idk if theyâll hang out or just stay in the room",185,34,18:01:05
Erica Yee,(and np if you have to go),26,7,17:58:39

Ben Fickes,Also I love your nu sci email title haha ð knowing you makes it extra funny haha,83,17,17:52:38
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Youâll have to tell me about it,42,9,17:52:17
Erica Yee,and wow nice!!,14,3,17:48:59
Erica Yee,call was fine. heard a lot about his work. he was on the orange line most of it though so bad reception lol,107,23,17:48:55
Erica Yee,book was good. really different from the author's debut novel which i love but with the same amazing writing style. and then at the end there's a bonus epilogue to her previous book which was a nice surprise haha,212,39,17:48:39
Ben Fickes,Also I just finished the last fight scene of reviving water! So close to the end,80,16,17:38:42
Ben Fickes,HAHA how was it? The book and call,34,8,17:38:21
Erica Yee,and now he wants to call someone else before going to yours,59,12,17:38:17
Erica Yee,but it was fine,15,4,17:38:06
Erica Yee,i postponed victor's call slightly because i was on the last chapter of my book LOL,83,16,17:38:05
Ben Fickes,And how annoying it was,23,5,17:37:56
Ben Fickes,Haha my great uncle told me about that boss,43,9,17:37:52
Erica Yee,in ac odyssey there was a giant wild boar boss fight that i tried so many times. it farts poison gas everytime you dodge which is v annoying. finally beat it after i got super good armor and weapons lol,202,40,17:37:29
Erica Yee,ohh interesting,15,2,17:36:44
Ben Fickes,I know that too haha. Very random and idk why Iâm thinking of this but in one of the dark souls thereâs a miniboss thatâs an armored wild pig,147,29,16:42:09
Erica Yee,"But you know I like pigs in any form, alive or on a plate",57,14,16:41:14
Erica Yee,Well I guess I do because wild pigs are hella scary,51,11,16:40:54
Erica Yee,Oh I don't care,15,4,16:40:40
Ben Fickes,"Iâm sorry, I know how you feel about pigs haha",48,10,16:39:14
Erica Yee,"But going for wild pigs this summer, for which you need guns",60,12,16:26:08
Erica Yee,Turkeys usually,15,2,16:25:26
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. What do they hunt?,27,6,16:22:54
Erica Yee,They actually hunt with those bow and arrows,44,8,16:22:35
Erica Yee,Haha there's pics of me on my dad's camera,42,9,16:22:22
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Lemme know what the temple is like please. Also thanks for the archery snap haha,89,17,16:15:04
Erica Yee,Gonna vidchat Victor when I get home then we're touring the Mormon temple,73,13,16:14:34
Erica Yee,Just had brunch with uncle's family in SF,41,8,16:13:39
Ben Fickes,"I see. Thanks for your input haha, very interesting. What are you up to today?",78,15,16:06:19
Erica Yee,Haha yay ok,11,3,16:05:46
Erica Yee,Not sure if there's gonna be weapons but kinda doubt it,55,11,16:05:23
Erica Yee,"Very cartoony in a cute way and very ""clean."" Like if I fell of a cliff instead of showing death it just blacks out abruptly before you reach the ground. And the third person pov camera is glitchy. Felt like half the time the bushes or whatever covered the screen",263,50,16:05:14
Ben Fickes,Whatâs the gameplay like? And I know!!! I will explain more over phone but letâs just say Iâm sure they really like you and your family if theyâre willing to come to CA haha,181,34,15:49:42
Erica Yee,I heard your mom and brother are coming!,40,8,15:45:52
Erica Yee,"It was cuz I started playing Rime, the free epic game two games ago. But I didn't really like it because after AC im used to being able to climb everything and this game felt really restrictive. Also there was no plot lol (at least so far)",239,47,15:43:13
Erica Yee,And I only had time to play borderlands for like 5 mins haha. It was good tho,77,17,15:41:19
Erica Yee,Childhood best friends reunite as adults and she's a celebrity chef,67,11,15:39:34
Ben Fickes,Whatâs the general plot of it again? I know you told me before sorry haha,75,15,14:54:56
Erica Yee,"Also interesting cuz the leads play the same character personalities they usually do (her in her standup, him in FOB and Ant-Man). But I guess they wanted to play those archetypes since they wrote the script lol",211,37,12:42:04
Erica Yee,But I thought it could've explored more about food and cultural appropriation (female protag's a celebrity chef) since they mentioned it a few times,148,24,12:40:23
Erica Yee,Movie was pretty good. Really funny,35,6,12:39:01
Ben Fickes,How was the movie? And borderlands haha,39,7,9:57:00
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,0:13:09
Ben Fickes,I saw one session of a few episodes a week or two ago,53,13,0:03:39
Erica Yee,Had you seen other episodes?,28,5,23:52:04
Erica Yee,Sadd,4,1,23:51:34
Ben Fickes,Just wanted to rant haha,24,5,23:44:24
Ben Fickes,Watched the fate/zero anime ending. Very dark and everyone dies. Pretty disappointed honestly haha,98,14,23:44:18
Erica Yee,i will :),9,3,18:05:02
Ben Fickes,Oh wow that is amazing! And gotcha. Lemme know how it is haha,61,13,17:55:48
Erica Yee,and nah it's the rom com written and starring randall park and ali wong,71,14,17:55:09
Erica Yee,short term missions sorry,25,4,17:54:53
Erica Yee,"currently working through this amazing tutorial that i think is similar to what i'm doing in my internship. or at least the process is similar, since it was created by journalists",179,31,17:54:50
Ben Fickes,"Whatâs STM? And is it the one you were telling me about, the politics and romance one?",88,17,17:54:22
Erica Yee,gonna watch a new netflix movie with my family afterward,56,10,17:53:57
Erica Yee,fundraiser dinner at church for teens' STM,42,7,17:53:44

Erica Yee,Have fun,8,2,17:35:03
Erica Yee,Oh right right,14,3,17:35:01
Ben Fickes,"Okay, no worries either way. And Iâm going to hang out with Michael RenÃ©e and Vivian and maybe watch anime with them later tonight",133,24,17:32:57
Erica Yee,Whoa just saw pics of the finished isec bridge,46,9,17:29:01
Erica Yee,"I forgot, did you say you're doing something tonight?",53,9,17:26:02
Erica Yee,Maybe Sunday afternoon but I'll let you know,44,8,17:25:10
Ben Fickes,"Not that youâre obligated to either of course haha, no worries if youâre busy",81,14,17:15:31
Ben Fickes,"I know victor just asked you haha but if you want to talk at all this weekend before you start work Iâm down. Would definitely be down to talk during the week if thatâs fine with you, but wanted to offer the weekend if thatâs better for you",246,48,17:15:14
Ben Fickes,Alright gotcha haha,19,3,17:14:13
Erica Yee,And yay!,8,2,17:12:30
Erica Yee,I guess haha but weekends are different,39,7,17:12:21
Ben Fickes,Why is today your last day of nothingness? Isnât Sunday?,58,10,17:07:53
Ben Fickes,Also worked through lunch so I get to leave work early today!,61,12,17:07:36
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! He gave me an incredibly cryptic reply,47,9,17:06:43
Erica Yee,Seems like he's planning to go,30,6,16:47:43
Erica Yee,My last day of nothingness haha,31,6,16:37:56
Ben Fickes,Yeah haha. Thanks for putting up with that call quality. And dang hope you get some rest early tonight and can get through the day,130,25,16:20:28
Erica Yee,Oh is that what you were trying to say on the vid chat?,55,13,13:31:37
Erica Yee,That headache messed up my sleep schedule but oh well gotta sleep super early the next few nights,97,18,13:31:25
Ben Fickes,Also I just listened to the voicemail I thought was from your family and itâs actually a spam call haha,105,20,8:35:38
Ben Fickes,"When you wake up, how are you doing today?",42,9,7:33:57
Ben Fickes,"No worries, I always appreciate prayer haha",43,7,7:33:49
Erica Yee,Oops sorry,10,2,22:09:57
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,22:09:54
Erica Yee,"Thanks, hope you sleep well",27,5,22:09:54
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm going to bed but hope you enjoy watching the warriors haha,69,13,22:08:47
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,22:08:33
Erica Yee,Have fun!,9,2,22:05:11
Erica Yee,Didn't even know there was a Godzilla movie lol,47,9,22:05:08
Erica Yee,Oh no,5,2,22:04:57
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you I'm seeing Godzilla with John and Renee on Saturday?,67,13,21:57:59
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha haha,14,3,21:57:38
Erica Yee,Oh it's hard to explain but you would immediately hear it (you definitely don't need to listen for it lol). It's like background vocals but you're shouting,155,27,21:57:03
Ben Fickes,(I haven't listened to her songs beyond the ones you sent),58,11,21:50:06
Ben Fickes,I do know anthem lights! I'll check it out sometime. And what shouty thing do you mean haha,91,18,21:49:55
Erica Yee,Have you heard of anthem lights? They also covered it and I like that version haha,82,16,21:49:31
Erica Yee,Every song on that album she does that shouty thing that I don't really like,76,15,21:49:17
Ben Fickes,"I have never listened to the original, only the cover haha",58,11,21:48:23
Ben Fickes,Yep haha,8,2,21:48:09
Erica Yee,Was it out of the woods?,24,6,21:47:14
Erica Yee,Yessss,6,1,21:47:07
Ben Fickes,Iâm the only one home (John and Shem are climbing) so naturally Iâve been listening to music and singing loudly. And one of the songs I listened to was the FK&C Taylor Swift cover haha. So I guess youâre influencing me slowly haha,236,43,21:41:32
Ben Fickes,"HAHA ð oh my goodness this is so funny. Iâm very thankful for your insights into middle school Erica haha, I feel like I have a somewhat detailed picture",158,29,21:40:13
Erica Yee,I could've sworn I wrote a full version somewhere but idk where it is,69,14,21:38:45
Erica Yee,She wrote the front and I retaliated on the back,48,10,21:38:06
Erica Yee,My friend found this from middle school haha,44,8,21:37:58
Erica Yee,I'll try :P,11,3,21:00:33
Ben Fickes,Please try to have a sequel dream soon ð,43,9,20:52:45
Ben Fickes,Whoah this sounds super interesting. Thanks for sharing,55,8,20:52:33
Erica Yee,And then I either woke up or I can't remember what happened after that haha,75,15,20:38:55
Erica Yee,They were hostile and uncooperative (but also who wouldn't be when these kids suddenly invade your space),105,17,20:38:42
Erica Yee,But there were actually scientists still alive in there somehow. And then I went all journalist on them,103,18,20:36:52
Erica Yee,"Eventually the tunnel led to this secret lab (definitely not in the book) from before whatever post apocalyptic event that happened, and we were ready to defend ourselves from whatever was left in the lab",204,35,20:35:23
Erica Yee,We were with other friend allies too but can't remember who,59,11,20:33:47
Erica Yee,There was this huge battle (idk who was fighting tho) but we slipped through it trying to escape and found this place to dig a tunnel,133,26,20:33:27
Erica Yee,You were there actually,23,4,20:31:40
Ben Fickes,"Also if you have time, what was your dream last night about, if you remember?",77,15,20:30:08
Ben Fickes,Np :),5,2,20:29:51
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,20:29:21
Erica Yee,Oh! Ok,6,2,20:29:17
Ben Fickes,She didnât tell me to say that haha,37,8,20:15:52
Ben Fickes,Also itâs her birthday today I think,38,7,20:15:44
Ben Fickes,She said to tell you she was grateful,37,8,20:15:36
Erica Yee,No what did she say,19,5,20:11:17
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you I told chichi you read her book?,47,11,20:09:50
Ben Fickes,thanks haha,11,2,19:26:42
Erica Yee,that is pretty funny x),23,5,19:21:19
Ben Fickes,And I think that's Josh's most watched video haha. He made it for a Spanish project,83,16,19:17:46
Ben Fickes,"He says, ""Somebody fix this!"" when there's bad weather which I think is funny. He also betrays your party (spoiler) and is the final boss",137,25,19:17:30
Erica Yee,though i think the woman who made them is from el salvador,58,12,19:17:24
Erica Yee,also the first video on his channel is what i had for lunch on sunday,69,15,19:16:53
Erica Yee,ohhh haha,9,2,19:16:46
Ben Fickes,He's from Xenoblade Chronicles X. He yells exasperated voice lines at your party when he's in it,96,17,19:16:39
Erica Yee,who?,4,1,19:16:38
Ben Fickes,Oops haha,9,2,19:16:02
Ben Fickes,He,2,1,19:15:58
Ben Fickes,Oh Lao?,7,2,19:15:55
Erica Yee,who's the game character,24,4,19:15:43
Erica Yee,lmao sempett,12,2,19:15:34
Erica Yee,i was using speakers too,24,5,19:15:30
Erica Yee,omg the ending,14,3,19:15:27
Ben Fickes,Np lemme know what you think haha,33,7,19:13:20
Ben Fickes,Oh I see,8,3,19:13:12
Erica Yee,and thanks!,11,2,19:12:56
Erica Yee,i think it's more of a priority thing because of the higher market share,72,14,19:12:51
Ben Fickes,Oh really? I'm not certain but I thought iOS was slower because of approval. Don't really know though,101,18,19:11:29
Ben Fickes,https://youtu.be/sZ1aYeeNJsk,28,1,19:11:11
Erica Yee,(i feel like android is usually slower for US-based apps),57,10,19:10:53
Erica Yee,and yay appreciated,19,3,19:10:41
Ben Fickes,But it's the same content,25,5,19:10:33
Ben Fickes,We send out the updates to both on the same day. Think it takes a little longer to go through on iOS,100,22,19:10:26
Erica Yee,LOL (Y) (Y),11,3,19:10:23
Ben Fickes,Roughly,7,1,19:10:02
Ben Fickes,"I added a great feature that's a banner that announces that, in fact, the most expensive pile of gems is the best value",119,23,19:09:59
Erica Yee,do you guys update ios and android at the same time?,52,11,19:09:50
Erica Yee,oh whoa,7,2,19:09:44
Ben Fickes,It's 75K gems of course,23,5,19:09:30
Ben Fickes,"Second number is changelist (like commit sha, but for perforce instead of git)",78,13,19:09:20
Erica Yee,what's the iap that cost $200,29,6,19:09:14
Ben Fickes,First number is release number,30,5,19:09:02
Ben Fickes,Wait that's what we use internally too!,39,7,19:08:56
Ben Fickes,Okay and now I have the go ahead from Josh to share. Roughly half is inside jokes haha,86,18,19:08:49
Erica Yee,That version number,19,3,19:08:33
Erica Yee,Wrong screenshot lol,20,3,19:08:16
Ben Fickes,Don't think we use that (internally) at Demiurge though for some reason,71,12,19:06:19
Erica Yee,ðð ok i'm good now,24,5,19:04:21
Ben Fickes,"Sorry I didn't share then, guess I wanted you to have reason to get to know me better ;)",88,19,19:02:17
Ben Fickes,Haha I got the full explanation at Pivotal and it helped a lot,62,13,19:01:59
Erica Yee,everything makes sense now lol,30,5,19:01:40
Erica Yee,"Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.",249,34,19:01:35
Erica Yee,you probably know this already but i just learned this and it's so helpful,74,14,19:01:27
Ben Fickes,Oh haha thanks,14,3,18:59:46
Erica Yee,free open source software,25,4,18:59:37
Ben Fickes,"But that's a good explanation, thanks",37,6,18:58:30
Ben Fickes,what is FOSS haha,17,4,18:58:23
Erica Yee,"both are FOSS but atom is maintained by github. it's more ""hackable,"" but i don't really watn to take the effort to customize what i need, whereas vs code has basically everything i need installed by default. i think it also uses less memory than atom in general",262,48,18:57:57
Ben Fickes,I've never used atom before how is it?,38,8,18:55:53
Erica Yee,oohok,5,1,18:55:20
Erica Yee,oh and i switched code editors from atom to vs code. weird because microsoft technically owns both now lol,106,19,18:55:19
Ben Fickes,Josh sent me an amazing birthday video I just watched. If heâs okay with me sharing it Iâm going to send it to you haha,123,25,18:55:01
Ben Fickes,Haha that is life changing. Hope the tutorials are not too mentally draining,76,13,18:54:39
Erica Yee,finally increased the font size in powershell which is lifechanging lol,71,11,18:49:57
Erica Yee,i've been doing some react/node tutorials,41,6,18:49:39
Erica Yee,whoa so cool!,13,3,18:49:20
Ben Fickes,Also some of my changes from the first two weeks are in Sega Heroes now!,72,15,18:41:58
Ben Fickes,How's your day been so far?,27,6,18:41:22
Ben Fickes,Dang double impressive,22,3,18:41:16
Erica Yee,yah she was one of the founding doctors of the clinic,53,11,18:39:33
Ben Fickes,And wow! And theyâre still working at 78? Thatâs impressive,63,10,18:33:37
Ben Fickes,Haha if this is a hangover then a full drink will kill me,57,13,18:33:10
Erica Yee,"speaking of booze, my mom's coworkers are bring ""happy hour"" to celebrate one doctor who's turning 78 ( :O :O) and calling it ""liver rounds"" haha",145,26,18:04:40
Erica Yee,going to grandparents' to watch later,37,6,17:48:52
Erica Yee,and yep it is,13,4,17:48:46
Erica Yee,wow that hangover is lasting awhile,35,6,17:48:42
Ben Fickes,NBA is today right?,19,4,17:44:15
Ben Fickes,Decided not to stay because I need an early night haha. And leaving now because I worked through part of lunch,110,21,17:44:14
Erica Yee,ohh gotcha,10,2,17:41:29
Ben Fickes,People are going to Roxyâs barcade around 7:30 or 8. I am 21 but definitely do not feel like going to that haha,113,23,17:32:01
Ben Fickes,Idk. I feel pretty tired. But if I go home I have to cook haha,62,15,17:31:21
Erica Yee,are you staying for the game night?,35,7,17:20:27
Erica Yee,and omg haha,12,3,17:19:47
Erica Yee,"i'm ok now, just tired",22,5,17:19:45
Ben Fickes,Had cake again at work today haha,33,7,17:16:33
Ben Fickes,"And haha ð man my house in Fremont was supposed to be a surprise, I was only going to tell you when I finished selling it",124,26,17:16:23
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang, Iâm sorry about your headache. How are you feeling now?",66,12,17:15:56
Erica Yee,Also also also this spam call mentioned you ð,48,9,13:18:32
Erica Yee,Also also I woke up in the middle of the night with a bad headache ð¢ before and after had this very intense dream about being in a post-apocalyptic world that was pretty different than the book I read,203,39,13:18:12
Erica Yee,Also our moms have been texting a lot apparently?,49,9,13:16:47
Erica Yee,Lmaoo,5,1,13:16:34
Ben Fickes,Think my mom is low key trying to see if Iâm hungover,55,12,8:22:29
Ben Fickes,I think so haha. Think itâs âbig chinâ with âstrongâ above it ð,76,13,7:01:46
Erica Yee,"Does that say ""big chin"" lol",28,6,23:06:25
Erica Yee,She sent me hers and Vanessa's,30,6,23:05:57
Erica Yee,Oh nice,7,2,23:05:52
Ben Fickes,"Before I sleep, this is RenÃ©es drawing of my character",55,10,23:05:30
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:35:10
Ben Fickes,It was RenÃ©e/Shem but I will tell you more later haha,54,11,22:16:34
Erica Yee,"oh ok good cuz i was like ""what would i have said...renee messaged me last night"" lol",85,17,20:17:32
Ben Fickes,Consider it a cliffhanger,25,4,20:15:59
Ben Fickes,You werenât the hint but I had a hint you would be calling haha,65,14,20:15:52
Erica Yee,Me??,4,1,20:08:04
Ben Fickes,Also will tell you when we talk next but something gave me a hint this might happen haha,88,18,20:06:31
Ben Fickes,Never tried vodka but the cider isnât bad. I feel it a little bit now haha. Thanks :),87,18,20:05:40
Erica Yee,Also I'm glad they brought cider haha I really like it because it tastes better. Renee was talking about bringing vodka (which I also like but in a different way lol),166,31,20:04:19
Erica Yee,Yw! Have fun,12,3,20:03:32
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much for calling! Sorry the reception was so bad but I really appreciate it :),91,18,20:01:50
Erica Yee,aw that's sweet,15,3,19:13:05
Ben Fickes,Gotta go to d and d soon but wanted to share that one of my coworkers went out and bought me a slice of cake and brought it to my desk. Which was super nice,156,35,18:51:57
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well thanks again for sharing. Sorry I just got off the phone with my mom and Josh,90,18,18:51:25
Erica Yee,"first started following him when he used to be part of a popular youtube boyband, but then he went solo. and actually competed on the voice china at one point lol",162,31,18:05:38
Erica Yee,but i subscribe to the guy's channel so would've seen it eventually anyway,74,13,18:04:55
Erica Yee,julia sent it to me,19,5,18:04:47
Ben Fickes,Haha ð glad you can predict me haha. One question unrelated to the others Iâm sure Iâll think of: how did you come across the video?,139,26,18:03:55
Erica Yee,you can ask questions and i will try to answer them xD,54,12,13:09:09
Erica Yee,thanks for listening! i knew you would want to talk about it haha,65,13,13:08:48

Erica Yee,Nah the all-staff meeting was cancelled because so she had the option to choose clinic time or admin time (she chose the latter and used it as sleep time),154,29,12:39:28
Erica Yee,Not going out anywhere I think but planning on refactoring my quote generator project to use react,98,17,12:38:34
Ben Fickes,Haha was she just running late?,31,6,12:38:08

Erica Yee,My mom really wants to go to this and she wants to know if you guys would be down,81,19,1:45:05
Erica Yee,Oh also I forgot to tell you that I listened to a podcast the other day featuring Rachel held Evans from before inspired was published and it was sad listening to it,165,32,1:08:28

Erica Yee,"i read the stars line as just ""reach for the stars"" in the inspirational-sense",78,14,22:38:07
Ben Fickes,I saw that! I wasnât sure if it was three eyes or two and a nose haha,71,17,22:37:06
Erica Yee,her specialty is the three-eyed smiley face,43,7,22:36:43
Ben Fickes,Your sister wrote many smiles and exclamation points haha,57,9,22:35:28
Ben Fickes,Yeah wow good memory,20,4,22:34:51
Erica Yee,"doesn't it say ""look to the stars"" or something?",48,9,22:34:24
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I can imagine your mom saying that. And why did you stare at that sentence so long haha,97,20,22:33:32
Erica Yee,i stared at the stars sentence for so long and astrology never even crossed my mind so i didn't even understand her note before she explained it lol,148,28,22:32:27
Erica Yee,"""he's not gonna even see it if he opens the envelope from the top but i can't let him thing i'm encouraging astrology!""",119,23,22:31:55
Ben Fickes,Your whole family wrote very kind words. Please tell them I say thanks :),73,14,22:31:48
Erica Yee,i did not read it but she did show me the astrological note,59,13,22:31:25
Ben Fickes,Wait you didnât know? She sent it in a red envelope,53,11,22:30:54
Erica Yee,my mom sent you money?!,23,5,22:30:34
Ben Fickes,Did you read what your parents wrote? Your mom said Iâm a âgood influenceâ for you ð,93,17,22:28:26
Ben Fickes,Also I love the ânot in the astrological senseâ haha,56,10,22:28:02
Ben Fickes,I love it! Also your family is amazing and Iâm so glad for their card! And my grandma (whoâs passed away) used to send me money equal to my age. So that was very cool to see the present from your mom!,204,42,22:26:38
Erica Yee,I was sad I forgot to use the Harry Potter stamps for my Israel postcards but the US flag ones were more ironic anyway,118,24,22:24:28
Erica Yee,Also I chose the hagrid stamp!,30,6,22:23:49
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,22:23:41

Erica Yee,"it's cool cuz they have some professionals but also recruit local kids for the musicals, so we've seen some people we knew haha",127,23,22:02:04
Erica Yee,"have i told you about this outdoor theater called ""woodminster"" in oakland? grew up going to summer musicals there, and they're showing newsies right when you're here!",167,27,22:01:33

Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs awesome haha,24,4,20:35:32
Erica Yee,it was good. after dimsum my friends and i didn't have anywhere to go since so many places were closed so we just sat in a car in the strip mall parking lot and hung out for a few hours lol,189,41,20:32:44
Ben Fickes,Oh how was your day/evening?,28,5,20:28:18
Erica Yee,just got back home btw,22,5,20:22:39
Ben Fickes,"No problem, thank you for all of your help",42,9,20:20:51
Erica Yee,Thanks for doing this and thinking about this stuff,51,9,19:53:29
Erica Yee,Don't think he has beef with Michael,36,7,19:52:25
Ben Fickes,Do you think I can invite Michael too or will he have an issue with that,72,16,19:50:01
Ben Fickes,I see. Iâll invite him then,29,6,19:49:48
Erica Yee,"Like I'm guessing if you invite him to a group thing, his first reaction would probably be to hide back inside himself. But I think he needs to socialize better in groups. My theory is that it's a part of why he's  averse to fellowships and church stuff",253,48,19:39:02
Ben Fickes,Hmmm donât know exactly what you mean by the last message?,60,11,18:26:12
Erica Yee,It's sorta a question of what he has a mental/emotional negative impression vs. what is good for him (according to me),118,21,18:25:28
Erica Yee,I think he hasn't hung out with group of guys his age in a while too..,70,16,18:24:33
Erica Yee,That's probably better then ð,32,5,18:24:12
Ben Fickes,Uh probably not entirely,24,4,18:23:56
Erica Yee,IV people?,10,2,18:23:03
Erica Yee,Idk actually lol,16,3,18:22:54
Ben Fickes,Real quick random question - if I invited Victor to hang out with me and others do you think thatâd be okay or a bad idea?,124,26,18:20:07
Ben Fickes,"No problem haha, thanks for talking even the little bit :)",58,11,17:48:44

Erica Yee,Omg yes gamifying church I like it,34,7,15:23:44
Erica Yee,Also the worship leader and his wife were both leading but the fellow church attendee tasked with watching their kids could not keep them corralled so the mom gave up and just left her post to take keep them away from the cords and stuff lol (our church is very casual),269,51,15:23:22
Erica Yee,"Bunch of new ones including one I really like called ""the kingdom is yours"" that kinda has a Beatitudes structure. Not sure who it's by but want to look it up later",164,32,15:21:20
Ben Fickes,"Church was good. Very lightly attended haha. Pastor is introducing a new system to try to incentivize attendance haha. Every Sunday you show up, you get one vote for a hymn. At the end of the summer theyâre doing a service with the top few hymns ð",252,47,15:17:14
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs great! What songs did you sing?,43,8,15:15:30
Erica Yee,How was yours?,14,3,15:13:38
Erica Yee,It was good. Probably not supposed to have favorites but my favorite worship leader led today,93,16,15:13:33
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,15:13:09
Ben Fickes,How was church itself?,22,4,15:10:32
Ben Fickes,But seriously thanks for sharing haha,37,6,15:10:21
Ben Fickes,Wow I thought Pastor Adam would be against polygamy ð,56,10,15:10:04
Erica Yee,At church met this new couple who had gone to aletheia in Boston until they moved here in February. Pastor Adam married them haha,129,24,15:09:17

Ben Fickes,Very random but I remembered our Galatians study and we should continue that sometime if youâre down,102,17,20:55:14
Ben Fickes,Why are they so awkward together?,33,6,20:33:28
Ben Fickes,Haha ð oh so they havenât seen each other but you know theyâre both there?,81,15,20:33:19
Erica Yee,I hope they run in to each other because my sister and Calvin are so awkward together,85,17,20:32:49
Erica Yee,"My mom and sister, and Calvin, are all at the same Costco. And they're both leaving there to our house since Calvin is picking me up ð",137,27,20:32:25
Ben Fickes,Yes please haha,15,3,20:31:47

Erica Yee,Well technically this is the first time we ever owned it since we inherited it haha,83,16,20:28:44
Ben Fickes,I still donât know though,27,5,20:09:55
Ben Fickes,Wait do you guys still own the condo? And if itâs hassle for three of us to come itâs really okay,101,21,20:09:48
Erica Yee,My parents said you guys can stay in the condo if it's the three of you,71,16,20:09:08
Ben Fickes,"Josh and my mom might be able to come too, still waiting to see though",70,15,19:56:22
Ben Fickes,Haha I appreciate that I will be grilled at a barbecue ð but seriously if they end up doing that I am sure it would be great to meet them haha,145,31,19:56:05
Erica Yee,My cousin's gf (whom he started dating in December so we haven't met) would also probably be there if this did happen,117,22,19:38:13
Erica Yee,"My mom told everyone that you're coming in July, and then they started talking about having a barbeque and ""grilling"" you lol",125,22,19:37:49
Ben Fickes,Of course,9,2,18:30:19
Erica Yee,The one loss I will remember as long as I live,46,11,18:29:51
Ben Fickes,I'm sure you'll regret this for the rest of your days,53,11,18:28:39
Erica Yee,Oh well haha,12,3,18:28:10
Erica Yee,There are a few ways but it never worked out for me,51,12,18:28:06
Ben Fickes,"Whoah that's wild, I really like that idea. And haha sad, is it possible to get bunnies or are you just stuck if you don't get them",131,27,18:26:41
Erica Yee,"You need bunnies to get carrots, but I never got any carrots because I never drew any bunny cards ð­ lol",106,21,18:26:06
Erica Yee,"The objective is to get as many carrot cards as possible, then at the end the winning carrot is decided randomly",112,21,18:25:39
Ben Fickes,Oh I get what you meant with that comment but I was very confused at first haha,79,17,18:25:23
Erica Yee,Plus human and dog feet,23,5,18:24:48
Ben Fickes,I haven't heard of it - is it like a traditional 52 card deck card game or one with its own cards? If that makes sense,118,26,18:24:03
Erica Yee,Have you heard of it? Card game,31,7,18:23:19
Erica Yee,We played killer bunnies,24,4,18:23:14
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,18:23:09
Ben Fickes,I was surpised you had family in NY haha. And the one that just got married in the spring? Glad you're having such a great time :),130,27,17:25:05
Erica Yee,My cousin and her husband surprise came from socal too,54,10,17:24:18
Erica Yee,My*,3,1,17:24:03
Erica Yee,It's good. Laugh so much with NY family,39,8,17:23:19
Erica Yee,The recipe (from my mom from high school) called for graham crackers but they wanted Oreos,90,16,17:23:08
Ben Fickes,How's your day been so far?,27,6,17:15:16
Ben Fickes,Ooh thank you for the pic! Do not think I have ever seen strawberries and oreos combined into one cake before,109,21,17:15:09
Erica Yee,So good (I ate the Oreo crust and strawberries),47,9,17:14:33
Erica Yee,I didn't snap so here's the cake,32,7,17:13:41
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,15:27:22
Ben Fickes,Read the article on Latin - actually very intriguing because my class was very focused on grammar and not speaking (since it is a dead language). Donât know if I agree with speaking helping to learn grammar but not like I can know,232,43,14:45:54
Erica Yee,No rush,7,2,13:45:22
Ben Fickes,And Iâll check out the pics in a little bit!,46,10,13:34:49
Ben Fickes,Sorry donât have fully formed thoughts and weâre going to lunch now but might actually send you a song related to signs from God haha,137,25,13:34:42
Ben Fickes,Whoah thank you for sharing that Erica. Makes me think more about Gods signs and ways He speaks to us and what it means to test God or not,138,29,13:33:56
Erica Yee,just thought that was interesting and never noticed it vbefore,62,10,13:28:38
Erica Yee,"Gideon is affirmed by (unknowing?) other men which leads him to worship, even after God had clearly given him his own private miraculous signs",142,24,13:28:31
Erica Yee,"13 Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. âI had a dream,â he was saying. âA round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.â

14 His friend responded, âThis can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.â

15 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, âGet up! The Lord has given the Midianite camp into your hands.â Judges 7:13-15",643,114,13:27:53
Erica Yee,i'm reading judges and this really struck me. comes right before Gideon's successful attack:,92,14,13:27:28
Erica Yee,these pictures are so cute haha https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/23/students-learn-speak-latin-dead-language/npU5YsHGXdD3OLAiaBpUhL/story.html,151,7,13:11:08
Erica Yee,Glad you like it :),19,5,12:56:04
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð really thank you, that was really special :)",54,10,12:28:26
Erica Yee,Lol I found probably the last gluestick in the house and worked it to death,75,15,12:22:07
Erica Yee,You're welcome!,15,2,12:21:40
Ben Fickes,I just opened your present - thank you so much for the very thoughtful gifts. I love the card and I can tell you put a lot of effort into it haha,145,32,9:58:25
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,0:03:57
Ben Fickes,You convinced me haha,21,4,0:00:53
Erica Yee,Lol please don't,16,3,23:55:41
Ben Fickes,Or I could bring it to d and d on my birthday ð,50,13,23:51:00
Ben Fickes,Eh Iâll open it tomorrow haha,31,6,23:50:28
Erica Yee,You can wait till your actually birthday or not haha,52,10,23:30:09
Erica Yee,LMAO,4,1,23:29:55
Ben Fickes,"Thank you, Iâm excited to open it ð",40,8,23:29:26
Ben Fickes,"My mom said she got a package from you, but it got stuck in our mailbox and she had to use a crowbar to get it out ð",119,28,23:29:09
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,23:28:43
Erica Yee,Aww hope you get to rest,24,6,23:28:09
Ben Fickes,Have a couple thoughts but will wait until I read more,54,11,23:28:05
Ben Fickes,I read a little bit of it but then felt very tired and just did nothing haha,76,17,23:27:28
Erica Yee,Did you read chichi's book,26,5,23:25:11
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,23:25:08
Ben Fickes,Just landed in Philly,21,4,23:09:35
Ben Fickes,Will do :),10,3,21:19:35
Erica Yee,Lemme know when you land,24,5,21:13:45
Ben Fickes,"Well I am honored, unless you lose your eyesight haha. I gotta go now but talk to you later!",92,19,21:13:03
Erica Yee,I'm probably straining them unnecessarily by using my phone already but oh well worth (hopefully),97,15,21:07:41
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,21:07:20
Ben Fickes,Haha that is funny. Iâm assuming itâs part of the dilation right?,69,12,21:06:43
Erica Yee,Accidentally sent it to Victor too instead of closer female friends ð,72,12,21:06:25
Erica Yee,It's kinda disturbing but it was too funny not to send,54,11,21:06:06
Erica Yee,Also don't be scared of my snap please,38,8,21:05:54
Erica Yee,I'll try a spoonful of yours haha,33,7,21:05:46
Ben Fickes,Thatâs actually heartbreaking you wonât get to try one now,62,10,21:05:17
Erica Yee,Should've drank a Boston burger shake in front of you when I had the chance,75,15,21:04:11
Ben Fickes,The term last hurrah for that is so sad haha,44,10,20:56:42
Erica Yee,:O i'm glad,11,3,20:50:47
Erica Yee,it's cheesecake but i may be allowed to try a bit as a last hurrah,66,15,20:50:18
Ben Fickes,"Random but Iâm normally tsa prechecked, but I didnât have it today for some reason and didnât notice til I got to security. Was scared I was gonna miss my flight but theyâre very efficient tonight and got me through really fast haha",240,43,20:47:59
Ben Fickes,"Ooh let me know how the cake is haha. I have no plans haha, besides probably a dnd session with Josh and my mom",111,24,20:47:09
Erica Yee,What about you?,15,3,20:35:18
Erica Yee,"Yeah and our cousin is coming over tonight too, but I think he and julia are baking a cake for tomorrow",103,21,20:35:14
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Sounds like you have a lot of socializing this weekend haha but I hope itâs really good!,99,19,20:25:26
Erica Yee,Family party tomorrow and  helping my dad setup for church. Then grabbing dinner with Calvin cuz he's coming home for the weekend. Think I'm going to get dimsum with him and Tiffany on Monday too,195,35,20:20:59
Ben Fickes,Are you doing anything this weekend?,36,6,20:18:12
Ben Fickes,Thanks ð,11,2,20:17:50
Erica Yee,ohh I saw that on Reddit haha. And that's cool :),49,11,20:16:05
Ben Fickes,Second is that I got to talk to my project manager (though that might not be her official title?) on the way to lunch and she actually shared a lot about herself which was nice since I donât get to hear much about my other coworkersâ personal lives,252,48,20:14:40
Ben Fickes,The first is that apparently the sonic movie is now being pushed back to Valentineâs Day of next year. And my coworkers are trash talking it haha,147,27,20:13:07
Ben Fickes,"Oh I have a couple of very random, small work stories",53,11,20:12:34
Ben Fickes,The ones that stay I guess,26,6,20:11:25
Ben Fickes,Oh wow you really know them then haha,37,8,20:11:17
Erica Yee,"Yeah they've been coming over since I was in high school, but some people have joined and left since then",105,20,20:10:59
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. I was gonna ask if you know them pretty well but guess I have your answer already haha,94,19,20:10:15
Erica Yee,Except last week of the month I think,37,8,20:10:04
Erica Yee,Yeah it's usually every Friday,30,5,20:09:54
Erica Yee,But my favorite people to talk to aren't coming :( oh well guess I gotta learn how to make conversation with others,115,22,20:09:47
Ben Fickes,"I forget, do they usually come over?",36,7,20:09:42
Erica Yee,My parents' small group is coming over for the first time since I've been back tonight,86,16,20:09:22
Erica Yee,Omg sad,7,2,20:08:44
Ben Fickes,I downloaded Chichiâs book to read on the flight,50,9,20:06:36
Ben Fickes,Now Iâm on the blue line shuttle but thereâs really bad traffic (go figure),79,14,20:06:25
Ben Fickes,I am! Logan express 7:40 was cancelled and I got there just past 7:20 so rather than wait super long I took the t,113,24,20:06:07
Erica Yee,Are you going home now?,23,5,20:03:45
Erica Yee,Nah it's seriously fine. The traffic is better then anyway,58,10,20:03:33
Ben Fickes,Itâs the 1:10 am one ð¬ I really can Lyft if thatâs better for you,72,15,20:02:08
Ben Fickes,Wow youâre so cool,20,4,20:01:50
Erica Yee,It's ok I was wearing sunglasses indoors lol,44,8,20:01:44
Erica Yee,ðð funny,14,2,20:01:33
Erica Yee,And yay! When does it get in,28,7,20:01:14
Ben Fickes,Sorry about the sunlight pain,29,5,20:01:11
Ben Fickes,"If you can see distance, how many fingers am I holding up?",58,12,20:00:54
Erica Yee,Couldn't drive though because they dilated so much that sunlight hurt,69,11,20:00:48
Erica Yee,Thanks xD I can see distance but not close up,45,10,20:00:30
Erica Yee,It's probably just a normal thing and the other doctor misdiagnosed it,70,12,19:59:55
Ben Fickes,"Iâm so glad youâre alright :) did they know what was up? And okay haha I can romantically lead you around while you canât see haha. Speaking of, I bought my ticket!",170,32,19:55:07
Erica Yee,I do have to go back on July 5 just for a checkup though. So I think I'm gonna ask for the day off and say I have a doctor's appointment in which I will get my eyes dilated so can't work the rest of the day (which is true lol). And then we can do whatever,255,57,19:53:43
Erica Yee,Sorry I couldn't read or text for a few hours after my eyes got dilated. Doctor said I'm fine tho!,98,20,19:52:41
Erica Yee,Ooh got it,10,3,19:52:20
Ben Fickes,"And how was the eye doctor, if youâve been yet?",49,10,17:37:39
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,17:37:27
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah I actually play it haha. Much better than marvel one in my opinion haha. Also I need to know stuff about the gameplay for everything I do haha,150,30,17:37:24
Erica Yee,play*,5,1,12:47:03
Erica Yee,So do you okay the game during lunch or outside of work now lol,63,14,12:36:13
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,12:35:58
Ben Fickes,And found out we get free in game currency at the end of the month ð,71,16,12:34:26
Ben Fickes,Also learned some interesting history of SEGA Iâll tell you later,67,11,12:34:06
Erica Yee,Ikr haha,8,2,12:31:25
Ben Fickes,You should save doing homework in your sleep for the semester haha,66,12,12:30:42
Ben Fickes,Oh no thatâs the worst haha,29,6,12:30:11
Erica Yee,The other night I slightly stressfully dreamt that my bostonography professor assigned more homework and I actually started writing the essay in my sleep lol,157,25,12:16:19
Erica Yee,Haha nice,9,2,12:15:37
Ben Fickes,"Also very random but you were in my dream last night haha. It was pretty ordinary as far as my dreams go - we were walking through a parking garage with a group of other people for some reason, and you and I walked in the back holding hands. Thatâs it but it was a nice dream haha, just wanted to share",304,62,6:17:34
Ben Fickes,Oh I remember you mentioning that curriculum I think,52,9,6:15:37
Erica Yee,"Probably not, it's just a project for this free web dev curriculum I've been doing on and off for a few years haha",114,23,22:48:34
Erica Yee,Aw thanks,9,2,22:48:03
Ben Fickes,Also I just looked at your website and that's so clever! Please let me know if you add more to it haha,102,22,22:25:33
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha I'm truthfully excited for it,41,7,22:23:55
Erica Yee,And thanks my mom's gonna send a card lol,41,9,21:57:45
Ben Fickes,Gotcha,6,1,21:57:01
Erica Yee,"Nah probably not rn, seems really busy",38,7,21:56:39
Ben Fickes,Do you think I should contact him? And my apartment number is 27,64,13,21:56:09
Erica Yee,What's your apartment number,28,4,21:54:31
Erica Yee,Victor and I are playing phone tag. I think he needs to rant about work,71,15,21:52:27
Erica Yee,Thanks in advance,17,3,21:49:28
Erica Yee,Ooh excited,11,2,21:47:38
Ben Fickes,"I listened to your songs - my reply is incredibly incredibly long, so take your time getting to it. Thank you for sharing again :)",130,25,21:41:22
Ben Fickes,Iâm about to listen to your music. My roommates arenât home so I wonât use earbuds but if they come home theyâll hear me listening to tswift ð,153,28,20:51:26
Ben Fickes,Haha ð Iâm glad it all got worked out,42,9,20:50:58
Erica Yee,"BUT we did find a good generic one under the category ""birthday religious"" ðð",83,14,20:42:17
Erica Yee,"My mom and I were looking for a birthday card for her birthmother but they all say ""mom"" and she wanted one that said ""mother."" Finally I sorta loudly said ""well we can just get a mother-in-law one and cross out the -in-law."" Then the woman started laughing really hard and said she might do the opposite for ""daughter-in-law""",326,59,20:41:37
Erica Yee,Sorry was driving home,22,4,20:39:57
Ben Fickes,What did you do haha,20,5,19:28:17
Erica Yee,Omg I just made a random woman at Target laugh I feel so awkward,64,14,19:27:54
Ben Fickes,Indeed haha. I guess also hopefully youâll know if itâs causing more problems?(??),86,13,19:23:39
Erica Yee,Quite fortuitous the rest of my family is lactose intolerant ð,65,11,19:20:02
Ben Fickes,I mean vegans do it I guess haha,32,8,19:16:16
Erica Yee,I guess I'll try to minimize lol,32,7,19:16:03
Erica Yee,I could stop eating dairy ð¬,30,6,19:15:49
Ben Fickes,Dang. Anything you can do for it? And wow haha glad youâre alright,68,13,19:13:30
Erica Yee,And ooh ok,10,3,19:11:32
Erica Yee,(the allergy doc disapproved of her experiment because I couldve actually been allergic to the drug lol),104,17,19:11:24
Erica Yee,No it's not getting worse but could be bad long-term,52,10,19:10:18
Ben Fickes,"My day was good. Very busy at work, thereâs definitely a ton of stuff piling up but Iâm working through it as well as possible",130,25,18:55:34
Ben Fickes,"Dang, is the dairy allergy getting worse? And wow I can imagine your mom saying that haha",89,17,18:55:05
Erica Yee,How was your day?,17,4,18:48:37
Erica Yee,"And found out my mom gave me an antibiotic as an experiment that she didn't tell me about to see if I would get the same reaction as last time, she gleefully informed my doctor lol",180,36,18:48:06
Erica Yee,Welp got strong exhortations to not intake dairy,48,8,18:47:21
Ben Fickes,You never know. And gotcha. Sorry for the late reply. Any plans after the checkup today?,88,16,18:46:17
Erica Yee,I'm ok. At annual allergy checkup,33,6,18:08:21
Erica Yee,Should be able to run it on my computer haha. And then when my dad comes into my room he won't have to see me slitting people's throats (unless this little boy protag is actually an assassin),191,37,18:08:02
Erica Yee,Rime I think,12,3,18:07:03
Ben Fickes,And how are you doing?,22,5,17:58:29
Ben Fickes,Ooh Iâll have to get it. Whatâs it called?,46,9,17:58:20
Erica Yee,The new free epic store game looks cool,39,8,14:22:07
Ben Fickes,No problem :),13,3,12:39:59
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,12:38:38
Ben Fickes,Well glad you got to have the time together. If you need to talk about anything Iâm here,90,18,12:32:44
Erica Yee,Because yay family time but also more because we didn't wake up in time to eat before lol,89,18,12:31:34
Erica Yee,I'm ok. My family's eating breakfast out together now before my mom and Julia go to work,88,17,12:31:10
Ben Fickes,"Oh thatâs right, I forgot that was today. How are you feeling about it?",73,14,12:26:38
Erica Yee,Just went to see my grandma's body and cremation. It was actually really good for closure and she looked better than we expected,128,23,12:24:20
Erica Yee,Glad she liked it,17,4,12:23:29
Erica Yee,Lmaoo,5,1,12:23:20
Ben Fickes,"Her exact message:
I received a postcard from Erica today!!!  Totally unexpected & exciting to see something interesting in our mail!",133,21,12:20:38
Ben Fickes,My mom got your postcard - thank you so much for it :),54,13,12:19:28
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, hope you have a good evening :)",39,8,22:53:04
Erica Yee,Sleep well!,11,2,22:51:59
Erica Yee,"Aw, thanks to you. You can look on your phone too tmr if it's easier, it is responsive but I was just doing the bare minimum requirements lol",141,28,22:51:56
Ben Fickes,"Thank you, Iâm honored haha. Hope it ends up being good! I gotta sleep now but I have a reminder to check out your website tomorrow haha",138,27,22:50:08
Erica Yee,"The writing's still eh, like your fight scenes in TSS are better lol. I get confused with the logic of the action here. But I'm invested enough now that I'm gonna stick with it",176,34,22:48:12
Ben Fickes,Oh I canât wait to hear about! Thanks for being willing to share :),69,14,22:46:27
Erica Yee,This reminds me I want to tell you about the fantasy-ish book I'm reading later. Thought about giving up but stuck with it because the romance potential (enemies to lovers + forced proximity plot) was so good and now I'm finally nearing it haha,244,44,22:44:57
Ben Fickes,Vanessaâs character is both of those things so guess we know how that would end ð,86,16,22:43:26
Erica Yee,And ikr,7,2,22:43:04
Erica Yee,I think I'm more into rogues and bad boys anyway ð,53,11,22:42:53
Ben Fickes,And sorry sheâs stressed but that is really funny haha,56,10,22:39:42
Ben Fickes,I will explain more fully but we are in a city in a cave with no memory so you probably would just be in my characters memory. But my character is separate from me so I will not do that haha,190,41,22:39:32
Erica Yee,(funny but not really to her but I'll still share) My mom is so stressed about work that she used real butter at dinner and ate ice cream afterward,147,29,22:39:01
Erica Yee,*the character,14,2,22:37:55
Erica Yee,Omg noo something bad would definitely happen to me,51,9,22:37:50
Ben Fickes,"Iâm home from d and d, it was good. Vivian thinks my character should have a love interest named Erica ð",109,21,22:36:01
Ben Fickes,I did not grow up with much of them haha. And HAHA thatâs hilarious because of Barbs haha,91,18,22:35:35
Erica Yee,"^ if so, that's Barbara manatee haha",36,7,22:28:13
Erica Yee,Iirc did you say before you didn't grow up with veggie tales?,61,12,22:28:03
Erica Yee,Haha you know I'm bad at making decisions and probably have too many questions but I'd be down to try,101,20,22:26:27
Ben Fickes,Probably final update for now but our team is called veggie tales haha,70,13,21:53:11
Ben Fickes,Enjoy dinner!,13,2,21:25:28
Ben Fickes,"If you ever decide you would like to try dnd, I would love to play with you eventually. But no pressure of course. And wow I hope you never have to borrow something from me in real life ð¬ð",194,39,21:25:23
Erica Yee,Dinner ttyl,11,2,21:25:10
Erica Yee,In AC there's a lot of stealing missions but that's too hard so if there's no consequences I just usually kill and then loot them,129,25,21:24:58
Erica Yee,(also probably what I would do),31,6,21:24:35
Erica Yee,Sneaky sneaky,13,2,21:24:30
Ben Fickes,Now Vanessaâs character is stealing my map (I bought) while I sleep,69,12,21:23:28
Erica Yee,Ooh nice haha,13,3,21:23:02
Ben Fickes,Mine is âArgentus Ferrâ and heâs a paladin. Name is a variant of âsilver ironâ in Latin because Iâm definitely a tank haha,134,23,21:21:33
Ben Fickes,Pretty sure thereâs a character in xenoblade chronicles 2 named Jin,69,11,21:20:54
Erica Yee,What's your character's name?,29,4,21:19:12
Erica Yee,I like that name because it can be Asian or not. It can mean gold in Mandarin. Also the cool main character in rogue one's name is Jyn,134,28,21:19:06
Erica Yee,Omgggg Renee,12,2,21:18:16
Ben Fickes,"Oh Reneeâs character is named Jin and is a part of a theater group called âBTS,â which stands for âBattle Theater Squadâ ð",135,23,21:17:08
Ben Fickes,Very good dnd session so far. My character is very lawful and is feuding with Vanessaâs who steals things. Josh (Eng)âs character just runs away from everything haha,169,28,21:15:25
Ben Fickes,My character is asleep while Reneeâs talks to the innkeeper haha,66,11,21:14:48
Ben Fickes,"My day was good, very busy at work. I implemented a character!",62,12,21:14:31
Ben Fickes,Ooh I canât wait to look at it later,38,9,21:14:17
Erica Yee,Couldn't decide on a real physical product to do. But don't worry I'll still take you xD,88,17,20:58:09
Erica Yee,https://codepen.io/ericayee/full/rgpQmZ,39,1,20:57:07

Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,22:40:13
Ben Fickes,Donât think you could not hype it up for me haha. Goodnight and hope you sleep well (when you do haha),104,21,22:37:23
Erica Yee,Gnight sleep well,17,3,22:36:58
Erica Yee,But ok sounds good,18,4,22:36:44
Erica Yee,Uhh wait did not want to hype it up lol,39,10,22:36:41
Ben Fickes,If somehow it misses me my mom will get it to me haha,53,13,22:36:02
Ben Fickes,"Okay you can send it to de then (2 Delanco ct. Newark, DE 19711)",64,14,22:35:50
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I am so excited haha,35,8,22:35:30
Erica Yee,Lol I should've sent it earlier but not done yet ah,51,11,22:35:20
Erica Yee,And don't want you to wait for it if it doesn't,47,11,22:35:01
Erica Yee,Oh I kinda doubt it will come by Friday though,46,10,22:34:34
Ben Fickes,And sorry for the late reply just finished dnd with Josh and my mom. Will tell you about it sometime but I should sleep now,123,25,22:28:46
Ben Fickes,If you donât have it already haha,35,7,22:28:23
Ben Fickes,"Oh my goodness ð thank you so much Erica. Hmmm I will say Boston, just to make sure I donât leave home before it gets here. My Boston address is 39 Hemenway st. Boston, MA 02115",182,36,22:28:16
Erica Yee,"If I send a box to you tomorrow that may take a few days in the mail, should I send it to Boston or Delaware",108,25,20:03:27
Ben Fickes,Np haha,7,2,19:49:51
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,19:49:37
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,19:49:34
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad it was good too ð,31,7,19:44:08
Erica Yee,Glad it was food :),19,5,19:43:33
Erica Yee,HAHA omg,8,2,19:43:21
Ben Fickes,Oh and he waved goodbye and said âsee youâ instead of just walking away and I felt very honored haha,104,20,19:33:57
Ben Fickes,Please do not spread that but I thought it was funny and wanted to share haha,77,16,19:32:54
Ben Fickes,Victor: âIt seems like everyone I talk to has nothing interesting in their life. Thatâs why I talk so much about myself.â,127,22,19:32:36
Ben Fickes,"Victor put a lot of effort into listening to me talk, I could tell (which I really appreciate). Perhaps unfairly I have a prime victor quote though",147,27,19:32:02
Ben Fickes,It was pretty good. Mostly was not dramatic and was just a casual hangout which seems like a huge step haha,107,21,19:31:29
Ben Fickes,"Haha youâre exactly right, thatâs what he got",49,8,19:31:05
Erica Yee,oohh the 50 cent frosty friendship haha,39,7,18:46:00
Ben Fickes,We are meeting for a âquick snackâ at Wendyâs before I play dnd with my family haha,89,17,18:41:53
Erica Yee,"and oh you didn't, what are you guys doing?",43,9,18:41:30
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang, do you have thoughts on the improvements yet? And nice on the dress code haha",86,17,18:41:30
Erica Yee,so guess i'm feeling better,27,5,18:41:17
Erica Yee,"seems pretty chill too. when i asked about dress code he was like ""uhh sometimes you'll see me wear my jordans"" lol",115,22,18:40:53
Erica Yee,"now i have some homework though haha. they want me to start looking through the code of older projects to see what i want to improve. and then since i never used node.js or react before, i want to do some tutorials.",215,42,18:40:09
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you Iâm meeting with Victor now? And thatâs right! I forgot that was today. Those are pretty good hours. Feel any better/worse after the call?,157,28,18:39:35
Erica Yee,"in other news, i had the call with my internship supervisor and it was good. i'll be working 9-5:30 and the office is right near a bart station",143,28,18:38:52
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,18:38:47
Erica Yee,i will,6,2,18:38:38
Ben Fickes,Dang. Please let me know how the appointment goes,49,9,18:38:22
Erica Yee,very slight chance but yeah,27,5,18:37:54
Erica Yee,you see spots in your vision,28,6,18:37:41
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. What are floaters? And is there any chance this can lead to anything worse?,91,17,18:34:22
Erica Yee,my vision's fine today but apparently i have a tiny retinal detachment ð¬ it should just go away but i have another appointment with a retina specialist on friday because this should not happen in someone my age lol whoops,224,40,18:24:56
Erica Yee,random but i actually went to an opthamologist today cuz last night i had some small floaters in my vision and my mom sorta freaked out,135,26,18:24:03
Erica Yee,i'm sure you did a good job too,31,8,18:23:32
Erica Yee,LOL omg,7,2,18:23:25
Ben Fickes,"Yep! But he talked about me being designated not because I did a good job, but because itâs annoying and time consuming to do and weâre understaffed haha",157,28,18:21:48
Erica Yee,does this have to do with what you said about implementing a new character?,75,14,18:08:03
Erica Yee,ooh nice,8,2,18:07:47
Ben Fickes,"My boss said something like âyouâll be the designated character guy for your time here.â Then he said âat least, for the summer.â So idk if that was a cryptic reference to possibility of an offer but anyways just wanted to share haha",243,43,18:07:07
Ben Fickes,Haha nice,9,2,18:05:51
Erica Yee,The final boss battle in the first rebooted tomb raider game includes button mashing and I just couldn't so Barbara finished it for me haha,139,25,13:01:42
Erica Yee,Omg lol sad,11,3,13:01:15
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you about legend of starfy? It was a ds game josh had and there was a QuickTime event (mashing a button) after the final boss. It was ridiculously hard and Josh never beat the game because of it haha,210,42,12:54:08
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness thatâs hilarious ð glad you could fix it,60,11,12:53:22
Erica Yee,"Forgot to tell you about the glitchiest thing that happened to me in AC unity: one of the ""boss"" battles (your former mentor, sad) include button mashing E. But no matter how much I pressed it, it wouldn't progress. Looked it up and seems like it's a common problem, the recommended workaround was put the game on low quality graphics and then try again. I did that and it worked ð",384,71,12:40:17
Ben Fickes,"Okay Iâm ready whenever, feel free to call whenever youâre free",67,11,17:55:06
Erica Yee,Just got home too so same,25,6,17:48:48
Ben Fickes,Sorry need just a few minutes,29,6,17:48:21
Erica Yee,Kk should be back before then,29,6,14:35:58
Ben Fickes,"Yeah no worries, definitely take your time",42,7,14:30:37
Erica Yee,Ok actually gonna be running errands before so I'll let you know when I'm back,78,15,12:55:36
Ben Fickes,Should be free around 5:45 est since Iâm finishing lunch now,62,11,12:46:02
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,22:40:39
Ben Fickes,I will for sure haha. And I guess I haven't told you about this but we are starting with a new group wednesday,110,23,22:24:44
Erica Yee,Are they still meeting up in the summer?,40,8,22:24:02
Erica Yee,Ooh tell me about it tomorrow,29,6,22:23:51
Ben Fickes,In other news Josh just helped me design a character for Michael's dnd haha,75,14,22:10:54
Ben Fickes,I was about to comment on how your paper stuff survived haha. Yeah no way I have my phone in 10 years,101,22,21:48:21
Erica Yee,But paper's gonna last (like Julia's baby instructions lol) if we don't get rid of it intentionally or lose it,110,20,21:47:53
Erica Yee,Honestly I'd be surprised if we're using the same technology in 10 years,72,13,21:47:23
Erica Yee,ð I know,11,3,21:46:50
Ben Fickes,I was kidding but I can record today's date for future reference haha,69,13,21:45:54
Erica Yee,Hahaha if you want,18,4,21:44:06
Ben Fickes,Should I set a reminder on my phone?,36,8,21:38:30
Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬ maybe in 10 years,26,5,21:38:05
Ben Fickes,That makes me want to read them even more,41,9,21:26:15
Erica Yee,Don't really want to read them yet... Too cringy lol,52,10,21:24:54
Ben Fickes,That's amazing haha,19,3,21:00:55
Erica Yee,"The earliest I can find is 2005, but I haven't been totally consistent",70,13,20:59:16
Ben Fickes,When did you start journaling?,30,5,20:55:50
Ben Fickes,I think that's a good call haha,31,7,20:55:44
Erica Yee,"I tore it out so I could save it bc I was gonna toss the rest, but my mom convinced me to keep my journals haha",111,26,20:55:23
Erica Yee,Lmaooo,6,1,20:54:13
Ben Fickes,Also I read your journal entry out loud to josh and my roommates haha,69,14,20:50:58
Ben Fickes,Thatâs pretty good! I think whatever name you come up with will be good,73,14,20:50:36
Erica Yee,"I like ""The Rockaway Record"" cuz of the alliteration but Rockaway is a pretty well known place in Queens so idk",111,21,20:49:26
Erica Yee,Omg ð,8,2,20:48:54
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. You should call it the Herald Star and have it be run by three wise men,84,18,20:42:18
Erica Yee,This is the extent of my brainstorming so far,45,9,20:40:05
Erica Yee,"And lol sure, tho idk if I'm going to commit to it",50,12,20:39:55
Erica Yee,Glad you appreciate it ð,27,5,20:39:08
Ben Fickes,Random but can I share your firefighter/journalist story idea with my mom and Josh?,83,14,20:35:42
Ben Fickes,Sorta haha,10,2,20:35:20
Ben Fickes,"I actually have childhood writing in my room, Iâll tell you about it tomorrow",79,14,20:35:15
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much for sharing,29,6,20:34:51
Ben Fickes,"The baby instructions are from Juliaâs perspective ð sorry I find that so funny. And oh my goodness thatâs even more hilarious. I can picture your voice as an 11 year old and itâs amazing. Also love the âGood night, Lord Jesusâ",240,42,20:34:44
Erica Yee,Here's the journal page,23,4,20:30:31
Erica Yee,"(which I sent to my family because the sentence after ""sleep"" is still true ð)",81,15,20:30:27
Erica Yee,Oh wait wrong pic LOLOL that's Julia's baby instructions,56,9,20:29:51
Erica Yee,Apparently I did try to write fiction when I was younger?? Have no recollection lol,83,15,20:29:26
Erica Yee,Still cleaning my room and found this in an old journal from 2008 (so I was 11),79,17,20:29:00
Ben Fickes,It was really me sabotage praying. Maybe Iâm just passionately against sports,79,12,20:26:40
Erica Yee,After his raptors lost,22,4,19:41:40
Erica Yee,Looool,6,1,19:38:59
Ben Fickes,Jk of course I would never pray âagainstâ anyone but that was too funny to pass up,86,17,19:25:16
Ben Fickes,Praying that they will lose so I will not be second to them,59,13,19:24:53
Ben Fickes,I will be praying for the warriors,34,7,19:24:36
Erica Yee,ðð thanks for knowing your place,38,6,19:03:39
Ben Fickes,Iâll take it haha,19,4,18:53:01
Ben Fickes,Well on the bright side that means I rank somewhere between conference finals and championship,94,15,18:52:58
Erica Yee,"Wellllll it is an elimination game, but it's conference finals not championship....if it was a championship elimination game I would have some bad news for you ð¬",164,27,18:45:27
Ben Fickes,But letâs just say I might coincidentally have a 5 hour story to tell you tomorrow ð,89,17,18:33:39
Ben Fickes,I was afraid of what I would discover,37,8,18:33:17
Erica Yee,But yeah that should work,25,5,18:19:02
Erica Yee,Whew thought you were testing me to see I would choose you over the game ð,77,16,18:18:55
Ben Fickes,"Oh I was debating between saying 6 eastern or 3 pacific and messed up haha, meant 6 eastern",91,18,18:08:33
Erica Yee,Wait do you mean 6 eastern or is that sarcasm lol,49,11,18:07:33
Ben Fickes,Maybe around 6 pacific when I finish work? Might be done slightly earlier but probably then,91,16,18:04:47
Ben Fickes,Wow I see your priorities,25,5,18:04:30
Erica Yee,Ideally not during the warriors game which is at 6 pacific haha,63,12,18:03:14
Erica Yee,Just lemme know what time is good for you,41,9,18:02:08
Erica Yee,Yeah should be good,19,4,18:02:02
Ben Fickes,Would you be free at all to talk on the phone tomorrow? No worries if youâre not,82,17,17:47:37
Erica Yee,Oooh interesting,16,2,17:26:03
Ben Fickes,Josh and I also discovered this new thing in destiny - apparently there are these things called lost sectors which are something like secret mini dungeons? Theyâve been on the map this whole time haha,202,35,17:02:32
Ben Fickes,Whoah thatâs so cool! And impressive haha,43,7,17:01:37
Erica Yee,As a side note looks like a Viet version of Thiago with a man bun ð,70,16,16:07:01
Erica Yee,Think he's only in his 20s ð® idk where the investment came from,66,13,16:00:54
Erica Yee,"He's planning to hold after school programs and summer camps, and even holding classes for local moms",101,17,16:00:37
Erica Yee,But there wasn't an affordable ND accessible one in Oakland so he opened one near one of the charter schools (called think college now haha) in the church neighborhood,167,29,15:59:45
Erica Yee,Growing up his family didn't have much so he never got to play sports like other kids. Then in college he discovered rock climbing and it was a cool way to make friends and build confidence. Apparently it's such a thing now it's gonna be in the next Olympics,258,49,15:58:31
Ben Fickes,Oh really? What did he say about it?,36,8,14:49:37
Erica Yee,Omg this guy at church gave a testimony about his rock climbing gym he just opened in Oakland as a ministry to inner city kids and it's so cool,143,29,14:38:57
Ben Fickes,"Oh whoah that sounds really cool. And dang sorry to hear that haha, hopefully you have a chance at some point this summer",121,23,13:03:07
Erica Yee,"I've been wanting to see a movie but there's not really anything I'm interested in, let alone my family can agree on lol",120,23,12:51:04
Erica Yee,Yeah we've gotten 3 inches the last few days,44,9,12:49:01
Erica Yee,Then we're gonna have lunch with these Eritrean refugees who were staying in my grandma's condo for a while (got connected with them thru the church),149,26,12:48:10
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Itâs pouring here but I didnât expect you to get it too,70,14,12:47:16
Erica Yee,Um my parents' church was supposed to have church in the park but it's pouring so nope,86,17,12:46:45
Erica Yee,I'm really glad and grateful :),31,6,12:45:50
Ben Fickes,Are you and your family doing anything fun today?,49,9,12:35:16
Ben Fickes,Well either way that sounds a lot more positive than I thought so I feel pretty good about things with Victor,109,21,12:35:05
Erica Yee,But maybe you're right actually whoopa,38,6,12:34:14
Erica Yee,"Ohhh I read that part as there's not much going on to talk about, which is why I suggested you guys could do other things",121,25,12:33:18
Ben Fickes,Haha that actually makes me feel amazing and coming from him I know that means a lot,84,17,12:32:59
Erica Yee,"The conversation started cuz he said you were making an effort to get to know him. And then I asked if he wanted to, and he said ""I don't mind"" haha",148,31,12:32:10
Ben Fickes,I just meant on the âthereâs not much in my lifeâ part. I thought the rest signaled progress too but thought it would be bad to say âIâm glad heâs more of my friendâ and ignore that part,200,38,12:31:44
Erica Yee,Oh I thought this signaled progress,35,6,12:30:45
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang. I hope heâs alright. I asked him to meetup this week, donât know if itâll work out though. But maybe I could try to grab a quick dinner with him",159,32,12:30:24
Erica Yee,"Also btw I gave Victor your Snapchat (he periodically deletes his tho) cuz he asked, and then",93,17,12:27:48
Erica Yee,That is a good metaphor haha,28,6,12:26:51
Erica Yee,Oooooooh gotcha xD,18,3,12:26:38
Ben Fickes,Oh I did not explain that well at all. Everyone was talking about how much Josh looked like me with my hoodie but not exactly the same. And Brian captured the difference in âBen is bold and Josh is italicsâ,210,40,8:13:05
Erica Yee,And I don't get it haha,23,6,0:27:10
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad,12,3,0:27:02
Ben Fickes,Real quick story before I go to bed: I gave Josh my hoodie because it was cold and Brian said âBen is bold and Josh is italicsâ and I found that hilarious haha,163,33,0:23:01
Ben Fickes,It was good! Some big plot holes and some rushed plot points but liked it overall. Surprisingly I really visually enjoyed all the PokÃ©mon in the movie,151,27,0:22:02
Erica Yee,How was the movie?,18,4,0:06:27
Ben Fickes,Haha ð you shouldâve told her PokÃ©mon haha,48,8,0:00:47
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,21:26:37
Erica Yee,"Grandma: so is Ben watching the warriors game too?
Me: nah he's not into sports
G: what?!?! So what is he into?
Me: uhhh lol
G: he's only an intellectual then, huh",163,32,21:26:35
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,19:04:46
Erica Yee,Ooh hope it's good haha,23,5,19:01:41
Ben Fickes,Detective pikachu at amc Boston,31,5,18:59:34
Erica Yee,And what theater,16,3,18:56:54
Erica Yee,Haha what movie,15,3,18:56:51
Ben Fickes,Apparently our movie that my mom bought tickets for has mandarin subtitles,74,12,18:55:27
Erica Yee,And LOL nice!,13,3,18:44:30
Erica Yee,Got it,6,2,18:44:24
Ben Fickes,I came up with the Tread Carefully pun at work haha,51,11,18:41:24
Ben Fickes,"Also, a very bright accomplishment from co op:",46,8,18:41:05
Ben Fickes,My bad,6,2,18:40:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah I knew what you meant I just very poorly worded my reply haha,66,14,18:40:10
Erica Yee,But yeah that sounds cool,25,5,18:39:39
Erica Yee,Oh I meant I think you probably wouldn't want to invest in AC unity specifically,80,15,18:39:35
Ben Fickes,Weâll see haha. Think at some point I will at least attempt a Slay the spire mod,82,17,18:34:55
Erica Yee,Seems fun but that's because I'm already familiar with all the controls and navigation and environment from playing the story. Don't think you'd want to invest in the game just for that,185,32,18:34:15
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Are the co op ones good?,35,8,18:27:57
Erica Yee,Tried one and my partner had to revive me 3 times lmao,54,12,18:27:18
Erica Yee,I've been playing ac unity and there's actually co-op missions,62,10,18:27:07
Erica Yee,Oh nice haha,12,3,18:25:23
Ben Fickes,We could use some cleaning here haha,36,7,17:59:08
Ben Fickes,Just finished! Was not the final mission but oh well. We got tanks so it was pretty good,88,18,17:58:57
Erica Yee,Are you guys still gaming?,26,5,17:18:51
Erica Yee,"I'm good, deep cleaning my room haha",36,7,17:18:42
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,16:32:40
Erica Yee,Lol (y),7,2,0:30:02
Ben Fickes,"Iâll just ask John later, Josh and I are just playing smash while John talks to her haha",90,18,0:25:53
Erica Yee,Can you text Jason to ask,25,6,0:04:25
Erica Yee,Hahaha omg,10,2,0:04:19
Ben Fickes,Sorry just wanted to share since I canât out loud now haha,60,12,23:53:11
Ben Fickes,"John has a friend over and I said âoh I donât think weâve met, Iâm Ben.â And she said, âwe have, but thatâs okay.â But I still donât know who she is! Jason called her Melanie Lam which made me think sheâs Johns sister? But then she said âIâm from New York near himâ so Iâm just very confused",319,59,23:52:56
Erica Yee,Oh yay!,7,2,23:15:18
Ben Fickes,"Talked to Fabricio too, he seems to be doing well",49,10,23:13:07
Ben Fickes,Yep! Weâre hanging out now,28,5,23:12:50
Erica Yee,Josh get in ok?,15,4,22:53:50
Erica Yee,Aww,3,1,22:53:41
Ben Fickes,I will send it in my next email haha. And I was the only one so they waited for the next departure so it wouldâve been faster to take the t ugh,145,32,21:28:24
Erica Yee,And LOL good job remembering to take the Logan shuttle ð,59,11,21:15:08
Erica Yee,Ooh please send,15,3,21:14:51
Ben Fickes,"As a very random update, I hung out with Jason for a bit and now Iâm on the way to the airport to get Josh. Have been talking to my bus driver and turns out he drives school buses for Cambridge schools! Very friendly and pretty young. He said heâs excited to drive the Logan shuttle during the summer âbecause of all the cute girlsâ",340,65,20:45:25
Ben Fickes,I actually already have one tswift related song to send you actually...,71,12,19:55:18
Ben Fickes,âDepending on my feedbackâ haha,35,5,19:55:03
Erica Yee,Hmm maybe (depending on your feedback lol) my next email will be  Broadway songs or something,93,16,19:37:20
Erica Yee,Yeah ð¬,9,2,19:21:26
Ben Fickes,I do not follow tswift very closely but from what I have heard about her new music I am not surprised you donât like it as much haha,134,28,19:15:47
Erica Yee,I don't like her new stuff as much as her old stuff even though they sound more like the other music I like,107,23,19:15:13
Erica Yee,And LOL hopefully they don't disappoint,39,6,19:14:11
Erica Yee,Oh yay!,7,2,19:14:02
Ben Fickes,Donât think I have ever been so excited to listen to Taylor Swift songs ððð,86,15,18:58:35
Ben Fickes,Also I actually think I got better over the course of work today which has never happened before when Iâm sick,112,21,18:55:55
Ben Fickes,Actually Iâll read today and listen next week,47,8,18:55:33
Erica Yee,Haha ok,7,2,18:54:47
Ben Fickes,I think Iâm going to save reading it as a treat for next week,63,14,18:29:37
Ben Fickes,"You donât have to write it out, Iâll enjoy it even if I have to google stuff haha",85,18,18:29:17
Erica Yee,Idk if I've ever tried to write out my music nerdiness but hopefully you can kinda get what I'm trying to say,109,22,17:41:41
Erica Yee,Lol it's a lot of rambling,26,6,17:40:51
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,17:40:40
Ben Fickes,Glad to hear it :) Josh is gonna be here around 9 my time. And I am so so excited to read your email! Thank you so much for it ð,131,31,17:31:18
Erica Yee,I have way too much time so I just sent you a very long music email lol...know you're busy this weekend so no rush but this is just a forewarning!!,147,30,16:05:34
Erica Yee,when's josh coming?,19,3,14:53:52
Erica Yee,Nah my mom just wants me to exercise in some shape or form later,64,14,13:26:30
Erica Yee,Yes I think so. They're all happy with how the service went. And honestly I think watching the game with my uncle who flew down from Washington at my grandparents helped. Because it gave us a different reason to be very stressed until we squeaked out a victory in the end lol,275,52,13:25:44
Ben Fickes,Are things calmer for your family now? And do you have any plans for today?,75,15,12:19:23
Erica Yee,Omggg,5,1,12:15:17
Ben Fickes,Iâve been at work since 9 (my time) and havenât done anything because my computer is updating...,100,17,9:36:50
Ben Fickes,"Donât worry, I am",19,4,7:31:54
Erica Yee,Ok please take care of yourself,31,6,22:28:25
Ben Fickes,"Iâll reach out to him again. I hope it was good. And thanks, drank tea and then refilled the mug with hot water repeatedly at work haha",137,27,22:27:27
Erica Yee,Aw noo hope you feel better,27,6,22:26:13
Erica Yee,"Me: Was it good talking with Ben? (After he brought it up)
V: sure",66,14,22:26:01
Ben Fickes,And yeah she does haha,22,5,22:25:42
Ben Fickes,Sorry Iâm actually going to bed now because I think I might be sick. But of course if you need anything at all feel free to call!,131,27,22:25:35
Erica Yee,"Or at least my mom reads that email, idk if yours does too haha",63,14,22:25:30
Erica Yee,Lol she probably saw it in the news@northeastern like me,56,10,22:25:05
Ben Fickes,Itâs theater but not improv. I think we did one improv exercise though,72,13,22:24:52
Ben Fickes,MY MOM SENT ME THE SAME ARTICLE,31,7,22:24:36
Erica Yee,Would you consider eloquent presenter an improv class??,55,8,22:20:41
Erica Yee,"âOh, My God, Where Is This Going?â When Computer-Science Majors Take Improv https://www.wsj.com/articles/oh-my-god-where-is-this-going-when-computer-science-majors-take-improv-11557846729",191,13,22:20:29
Erica Yee,Ooh sure ok,11,3,21:43:31
Ben Fickes,I actually also have something wild I learned about my mom yesterday. But I'll tell you about it in person because it's a bit to explain and I'd like to be able to talk about it in depth,186,38,21:40:57
Ben Fickes,Whoah that's crazy and amazing. It's also crazy how she gets to learn about all of this now,91,18,21:40:14
Erica Yee,Basically how a relative who knew they wanted a baby connected them with a doctor who connected them with the doctor seeing my mom's birthmother. Then she checked into the hospital under my adopted grandmother's name and said my adopted grandfather was the dad. He paid for everything and that's why my adopted grandparent's names are on my mom's sketchy birth certificate,372,62,21:35:40
Ben Fickes,I'm glad :) what did she hear? Unless you can't say,51,11,21:27:42
Erica Yee,My mom actually got some new details about her adoption stuff from relatives that came that she rarely sees,107,19,21:26:55
Erica Yee,Yeah they're happy with how it went,35,7,21:26:26
Ben Fickes,Is your family doing alright?,29,5,21:18:11
Erica Yee,"And thanks, she was :)",22,5,21:16:21
Erica Yee,You learn something new everyday xD,35,6,21:15:42
Erica Yee,LOLOLOL,7,1,21:14:04
Ben Fickes,I also did not know until literally just now that women use squares for number one haha,87,17,21:11:40
Ben Fickes,Your grandma sounds really amazing and funny. I actually remember you telling me the mahjong story haha,103,17,21:11:19
Ben Fickes,"I could hear your voice, and I also am proud because I realized on my own purple was you and blue was Julia",107,23,21:10:56
Erica Yee,"Blue is what Julia said and purple is what said, but we wrote the whole thing together (I think you can probably hear my voice throughout tho lol)",146,28,21:09:43
Erica Yee,No worries,10,2,21:06:02
Ben Fickes,"Oh sorry I missed it, Iâll take a look now",44,10,21:04:51
Erica Yee,Oh I think I shared the Google doc with you,43,10,21:04:26
Ben Fickes,"Nice haha, I can imagine that haha. What did you talk about?",60,12,21:02:00
Erica Yee,And you know how indecisive I am so I ended up playing a medley of songs haha,77,17,21:01:28
Erica Yee,I just read off the thing we wrote,34,8,21:00:58
Erica Yee,Not really actually,19,3,21:00:52
Ben Fickes,Was it hard to speak at it?,27,7,20:56:00
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð thatâs hilarious,28,4,20:55:41
Erica Yee,"My dad was live narrating the slide show of photos, which was chronological of my grandma's life. At one point he was like ""and then Lisa shows up!"" But he wasn't exactly in sync with the photos so the next slide was my mom's parents with one of their dogs, not my mom ðð",277,54,20:52:39
Erica Yee,"I'm not bad. Tired, especially after all the socializing, but it was good",73,13,20:49:51
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad :) how are you doing? When you have time,51,11,16:30:20
Erica Yee,Don't have time to talk now but it was a good service and our talk went well and people laughed lol,99,21,15:31:46
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. Hope itâs all good,36,7,13:10:03
Erica Yee,Omg my mom emailed my dad's side (the more American side) to tell them to laugh at our stories ð­ð,103,20,12:28:01
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I really appreciate it",30,5,12:25:22
Ben Fickes,Just wanted to say again Iâm thinking of and praying for your family today. I hope you all have peace,103,20,6:36:45
Ben Fickes,No problem :),13,3,21:59:10
Erica Yee,thank you :),12,3,21:59:00
Ben Fickes,"No worries at all, Iâm just here if you need anything",55,11,21:56:18
Erica Yee,Sorry don't think I have time to talk more tonight,50,10,21:55:59
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,21:55:50
Ben Fickes,I'll be praying for you,23,5,21:51:17
Erica Yee,11,2,1,21:37:41
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. What time is it tomorrow?,33,6,21:19:14
Erica Yee,My dad's gonna live narrate it,30,6,21:18:16
Erica Yee,All photos haha,15,3,21:18:10
Ben Fickes,Is it mostly photos?,20,4,20:23:11
Erica Yee,i gotta make the powerpoint rn,30,6,19:30:03
Erica Yee,hope it's good,14,3,19:29:58
Ben Fickes,Okay take your time! I'm on the phone with Josh,47,10,19:06:51
Erica Yee,Hmm I can reply more in depth in a bit,38,10,18:44:38
Ben Fickes,Normally I get out at 6. And gotcha. How are you feeling about everything? Beyond logistics I guess but if thatâs whatâs on your mind thatâs okay too,155,28,18:16:33
Erica Yee,We're basically scrambling to get even the small service ready for tomorrow lol,79,13,18:13:44
Erica Yee,I'm good. Went with my dad to the funeral home to test the AV equipment,71,15,18:13:20
Erica Yee,What time do you usually get out?,33,7,18:12:48
Erica Yee,Ooh,3,1,18:12:40
Ben Fickes,It was good! I got to leave early because I worked through lunch because there was a lunch meeting about benefits Iâm not eligible for haha. Fixed a bug and then got to work on server code (in Go haha). How was your day? Or is your day so far I guess,252,52,18:09:39
Erica Yee,How was work?,13,3,18:07:30
Erica Yee,Almost!,7,1,18:07:22
Ben Fickes,Did you decide on songs yet?,28,6,18:04:25
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, if youâre willing Iâd really appreciate it",54,8,18:04:18
Erica Yee,I can send the talk to you after I finish,41,10,17:32:43
Erica Yee,Actually having a really nice time writing it and reminiscing with my sister,76,13,17:32:33
Erica Yee,Well hopefully people will laugh or else this is gonna be super awkward lol,75,14,17:32:08
Erica Yee,We decided gonna be pretty funny,32,6,17:31:53
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs tough. What are your thoughts so far? Do you have stories from both categories?,91,16,17:19:36
Erica Yee,"My sister and I are trying to decide whether to tell funny stories in our sharing cuz traditional Chinese funeral is supposed to be very serious. At my grandfather's, my uncle was legit like ""don't smile."" But that was a big funeral, whereas this is a smaller memorial service",276,49,12:44:32
Erica Yee,Think it's to cancel out the sadness or something lol,53,10,12:42:49
Ben Fickes,Also wanted to ask about what you snapped - the candy and dollar bill. Was just curious if there was a reason for the tradition or if thatâs just what it is,158,32,12:41:32
Ben Fickes,Yeah that one! And gotcha. Hope you and your family have a good day today. And whoah guess things are going well. âFor now yesâ wow. Anyways I gotta go because Iâm working through lunch today but will talk later,217,40,12:41:04
Erica Yee,Also not to change subjects abruptly but saw this on Fabricio's ig,66,12,12:25:15
Erica Yee,Omg the one I accidentally emailed?,35,6,12:24:27
Erica Yee,"It's pouring here, Oakland is supposed to get the usual amount we get in a month today ð®",91,18,12:24:18
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Finally slept a normal amount lol,41,8,12:23:58
Erica Yee,I'm glad!,9,2,12:23:50
Ben Fickes,Also a game designer here who sits next to me is really good friends with our algo professor haha,97,19,12:23:13
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,12:22:39
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica. Feeling a bit better now that Iâm at work and working :),72,14,12:22:31
Erica Yee,"Thank you for sharing. I'm sorry I can't really do anything from here and don't know what to say, but I know it must be tough for you. Praying for peace :/",155,32,12:10:43
Ben Fickes,Know youâre still asleep but I talked to my mom and feel a bit better now,75,16,8:58:45
Ben Fickes,"Okay so I was debating whether or not to share this but once again I think I should - all the stuff with my dad I was talking about came back when I was trying to go to bed, and itâs still on my mind some now. A lot of it is self-centered and self-pitying thoughts, and I can spare you details (itâs a lot and I know you have a crazy amount of stuff going on in your life right now), but anyways a lot of it is missing my dad and remembering how much he cared. Anyways of course this is not on you to fix which is why I hesitated to share but I figure as part of getting to know me in a relationship you deserve to get to hear about this stuff and know this part of me too",676,144,8:12:57
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness - so can you recover the high school one or do you need me to download and send it or something?,111,24,7:35:06
Erica Yee,thank God i sent the screenshots to you earlier lol,51,10,0:58:45
Erica Yee,"cuz i messed up the syncing on onenote and then signed out to try to fix it, but that deleted all the stuff that was only stored locally (i.e., all my notes that i typed on my phone)",182,38,0:58:40
Erica Yee,the high school stuff too (though good thing i shared the one chapter i wrote with you on google doc),101,20,0:58:06
Erica Yee,omg i think i accidentally lost all my writing notes,52,10,0:57:21
Erica Yee,Hope you sleep well :) thanks again for listening/reading all my thoughts today,79,13,22:44:22
Erica Yee,"Because it's more fleshed out than my other ideas, even the high school one, and after talking to you a bit, I feel like I do want to write it",142,30,22:42:49
Ben Fickes,"Oh I have something brief from talking with Michael to tell you sometime. Also I would love to hear any more about your story and inspiration. But Iâm pretty tired and Iâm gonna go to bed, so, even though I know youâre not sleeping yet, goodnight!",253,46,22:38:49
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Do you think youâll start writing it anytime soon, or this is for down the road?",90,17,22:37:20
Erica Yee,"The fire part is actually inspired by this podcast I listened to several months ago interviewing the SF chronicle wildfire reporter after the bad California ones. She's sooo amazing. And the ofc the journalism stuff is what I'm familiar with, even though I don't know what it's like to live in a small town or work at a small newspaper",335,60,22:31:26
Erica Yee,"And thank you for sharing that, even if it passed",49,10,22:28:32
Erica Yee,Hmm probably unconsciously? I wasn't thinking about mentoring when I told you that I wanted the intern as a side character but I felt it fit here,145,27,22:27:08
Erica Yee,Aww thanks :),13,3,22:26:01
Ben Fickes,"Also, was not gonna mention this but feel like your story is prompting me to - this morning I felt really out of it and lonely and missing my dad on my way to work. It passed more or less by the time I got to work. Anyways just wanted to share",243,52,22:22:30
Ben Fickes,And I also had a very vivid picture of the plants growing where the fire was and itâs beautiful,97,19,22:21:22
Ben Fickes,Also I really appreciate the firefighter character :),53,8,22:20:11
Ben Fickes,Was the mentorship with the intern based on the thoughts you were sharing about eighth grade?,93,16,22:19:45
Ben Fickes,Wow I like this a lot,21,6,22:19:17
Ben Fickes,No names is my favorite kind of writing haha. Reading now,57,11,22:16:03
Erica Yee,Lemme know what you think haha,30,6,22:14:07
Erica Yee,"P = protagonist, F = firefighter cuz no names yet",49,10,22:13:51
Erica Yee,OMG sorry I could've just copied and pasted it,46,9,22:13:28
Ben Fickes,Also Iâm gonna try to finish reviving water in the next week or two (if all goes well),88,18,22:12:11
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,22:10:51
Ben Fickes,"Iâm sorry about your mom being stressed, I hope things get better soon. But I would LOVE to see your notes if youâre willing to share! Excited to see what it looks like haha",177,34,22:09:00
Erica Yee,I can send you my notes if you want (be warned still cheesy though lol),71,15,22:07:50
Erica Yee,"It actually has a firefighter as the love interest cuz it worked better and it's more of a ""finding yourself""  than just a romance",130,24,22:06:19
Erica Yee,Who knows if I'll pursue it but I typed out the whole thing which is more than most of my ideas haha,100,22,22:05:29
Erica Yee,"Butttt when I laying in bed not sleeping last night, I had a modified idea for my newsroom story!",97,19,22:04:22
Erica Yee,I'm ok. My mom is very stressed which makes everyone else stressed,66,12,22:03:23
Erica Yee,Ok thanks,9,2,22:03:01
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,21:15:53
Ben Fickes,Think I might have some ideas on travel plans but will let you know about them later once things slow down for you and your family,130,26,21:15:42
Ben Fickes,Okay awesome :),15,3,17:57:05
Erica Yee,And I'm sure my family is good with it haha,43,10,13:19:29
Erica Yee,Yeah that should be fine!,25,5,13:19:12
Ben Fickes,And of course all of this is your family willing!,49,10,12:56:36
Ben Fickes,"Also, for July, when do you want me to come? Can I come the evening of the third or would you prefer I wait until later? Also my mom and Josh are âdependent on Joshs job, it he can get oneâ for whether or not they can come",226,48,12:56:24
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I will be looking forward to it,41,9,12:55:12
Erica Yee,"Ohh I don't care about my own stuff, maybe I'll try to send a secret message through my tab names next time ðð",116,23,12:35:59
Ben Fickes,*tab names,10,2,12:31:59
Ben Fickes,Haha same. But also I do look at the entire screen and tag names when you send those snaps haha ð¬,100,21,12:31:47
Erica Yee,I've probably inadvertently divulged private information through all the times I snap my computer screen too but oh well lol,124,20,12:31:02
Ben Fickes,Youâve been warned haha,25,4,12:27:40
Ben Fickes,I do the exact same thing,25,6,12:27:36
Erica Yee,Yah sorry couldn't help but read it haha,40,8,12:27:21
Ben Fickes,Also only really meant to send the last message but the rest of the convo wasnât sensitive so decided to send it all anyways haha,131,25,12:25:38
Ben Fickes,She actually did tell me about that! Rarely see him so I never knew he was dating in the first place and idk if theyâre still together,136,27,12:25:12
Erica Yee,He probably doesn't remember me but did Barbara ever tell you about how she accidentally set him up? (Idk if they're still dating now tho),138,25,12:20:56
Erica Yee,And I totally forgot about Aris x),34,7,12:20:15
Erica Yee,Whoaa hope he wakes up in time haha,35,8,12:20:02
Erica Yee,No headache rn but I think I'm gonna drink coffee lol,53,11,12:19:30
Ben Fickes,Jason sent this - guess I might have a running buddy soon haha,62,13,12:09:32
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang, Iâm sorry to hear that. Headache or none? And hope the driving goes well, glad you get to see your cousin. Hopefully you donât haha, I know I donât like to",170,33,12:09:10
Erica Yee,Hopefully I don't have to parallel park anywhere ð¬,53,9,12:08:19
Erica Yee,And I'm driving my cousin around to buy flowers for the service cuz he's really good at making arrangements (cousin's on dad's side just helping out and he doesn't own a car),174,32,12:08:09
Erica Yee,Not really .. I went to bed around 1 but couldn't sleep for at least a few hours and then woke up at 8 and couldn't go back to sleep,132,30,12:07:08
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today? Less tired?,36,7,12:05:05
Ben Fickes,Oh well thatâs good haha. Very glad heâs going with others,62,11,12:04:57
Erica Yee,"He's going with his brother and cousin, so apparently he's capable of traveling with others!!",93,15,11:09:07
Ben Fickes,Hmmm no I donât think he did,30,7,6:35:32
Erica Yee,Did Victor tell you about his Ju e trip to DC/MD?,49,11,23:50:05
Erica Yee,Ah ok haha,10,3,23:05:03
Ben Fickes,Yeah! Think we were definitely dating but wanna say it was only a week or two in,80,17,22:46:55
Erica Yee,That was when you were waiting for me to walk to class right? I don't even remember when in the semester that was,113,23,22:38:17
Erica Yee,Oh nice! And LOL,16,4,22:35:48
Ben Fickes,"Oh one funny convo:
Me: blah blah my gf blah blah
Roger: whatâs her name again?
Me: Erica
Him: were you dating the first time I saw you? I know you were the second time
Me: we had just started dating
Roger: ah. It seemed like you could be dating, but you werenât pulling any dating moves so I wasnât sure",310,61,22:30:53
Ben Fickes,"Every one of those songs is great, so great brainstorming and I know itâll be powerful. Heâs from New Jersey (him and Matt Kho have a mutual friend). He is Chinese, he was actually born there and is the first in his family to go to college. Ton of other super interesting stuff Iâll tell you about when we talk. And thatâs amazing haha Iâm actually envious",366,67,22:28:55
Erica Yee,Had 2 meals in the course of 3 hours lmao,41,10,22:25:12
Erica Yee,I'm still kinda groggy tbh lol. Mostly did laundry and read a bit cuz I'm still pushing off some work,101,20,22:24:56
Erica Yee,Where's he from? And is he Chinese?,35,7,22:23:36
Erica Yee,Ah I'm glad,11,3,22:23:26
Erica Yee,Brainstorming rn haha,21,3,22:22:51
Ben Fickes,How was your day? All 4 hours of it haha,40,10,22:19:34
Ben Fickes,"Rock climbing was good, enjoyed it but definitely donât have the time to go super regularly. Then got dinner with Roger and we actually had some deep convos, mostly about his family. He mentioned loneliness and games as a form of escapism. Anyways Iâm glad we got to hang out",279,50,22:19:24
Ben Fickes,Do you know which pieces youâll play?,39,7,22:17:39
Erica Yee,Sorta stressed but think it'll be ok,36,7,21:00:20
Ben Fickes,"How are you feeling about it? Sorry I know I keep asking haha. Gonna grab dinner with Roger so gotta go but rock climbing was good, will tell more later",152,30,20:49:04
Erica Yee,And yay I'm glad x),19,5,20:17:41
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I do. think I'm gonna be sharing, playing piano and making the slideshow",80,14,20:17:32
Erica Yee,He said Abby told him but he had suspicions from my snaps ð,62,13,20:16:47
Ben Fickes,"Also random but I used your umbrella today and it was very helpful, thank you :)",80,16,20:13:28
Ben Fickes,"And wow, I hope itâs âgood,â idk what adjective to really use but I hope you know what I mean",99,20,20:13:11
Ben Fickes,HAHA how did he find out?,25,6,20:12:19
Erica Yee,Oh also the service is this Thursday whoa,41,8,19:00:06
Erica Yee,Random but Ariel just found out we're dating LOL,48,9,18:58:26
Ben Fickes,"Haha hope you can leave at some point. And thanks, will let you know how it goes",80,17,18:52:20
Erica Yee,Have fun climbing tho,21,4,18:43:01
Erica Yee,I went to the bathroom and then now I'm back in bed bc I don't want to deal with things I have to do lol,104,25,18:42:55
Erica Yee,Eh rested I guess but too much sleep always messes with my head/neck,68,13,18:42:16
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. How are you feeling?,36,7,18:40:32
Erica Yee,Think I slept 15 hours,22,5,18:40:17
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,18:40:13
Ben Fickes,Did you just wake up haha,25,6,18:37:44
Erica Yee,Yessss and thanks,17,3,18:37:20
Ben Fickes,"Sorry about the table arguing, I know itâs a stressful time for your family and I hope they can figure everything out",119,22,6:41:15
Ben Fickes,"Have a couple thoughts on the outwardness of faith. The first is that I think of this since I wear a cross and I wonder if people think of me the same as they would if I didnât. I also wonder if someone looking at my life from afar who didnât know I was Christian would say âwow, thereâs something different about the way he lives.â But I agree with what you said and I think itâs also amazing that we get to grow in following Jesus, and the more we look like him the more apparent it will be we follow him",518,103,6:40:33
Erica Yee,"dinner was good but a lot of it was my parents sorta arguing across the table about what the funeral should look like (my mom - don't tell anyone except close family till after the service happens, my dad - why can't you let other friends and family love on you and support you in this time). and then my grandma is very hard of hearing so she was just going like WHAT? WHAT WAS THAT? the whole time lol",403,80,22:39:01
Erica Yee,that's it haha. just wanted to share,36,7,22:36:50
Erica Yee,"ok back home now so this is what i wrote in my journal when i was praying about it:
""but ultimately i know i follow a God who loves me unconditionally, and that i am saved by grace, not works. i don't need to wear anything or do anything to earn my salvation. i don't need to prove it to God, others, or myself -- though i hope God's love is seen in my actions""",361,75,22:36:41
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha, am eager to here the rest of your thoughts later. Hope it's a good dinner :)",93,19,20:14:29
Erica Yee,Wait didn't finish last sentence but grandparents are here sorry,64,10,20:11:39
Erica Yee,"Throughout the trip we saw so many devoutly religious people as evidenced by their clothes especially -- orthodox jews, orthodox Christians, Muslims. Which made me think as I do about sometimes wishing I was part of a tradition that had outward signs of faith. maybe not in dress, but growing up Baptist we didn't have any liturgy, let alone memorized ones, or even crossing ourselves. I guess I want something to show I'm Christian more than my usual ""slip it casually into a conversation"" or have people guess when I pray before meals",536,93,20:11:30
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah, that's pretty short I'll just type cuz I'm waiting at the restaurant",77,14,20:05:40
Ben Fickes,"Forgot to ask you about piousness, will ask next time haha",58,11,19:30:33
Ben Fickes,Yes of course haha,18,4,17:10:10
Erica Yee,Can I call? (So my mom will be proud),37,9,17:10:04

Ben Fickes,Okeydokey! And no worries haha,30,5,17:05:08

Ben Fickes,"I know haha. And okeydokey, phone or video?",43,8,17:03:16
Erica Yee,Lemme find my headphones and then I'll be ready,47,9,17:02:59

Ben Fickes,My uncle shared this photo - itâs Josh and I and three of our cousins with our grandma on my dads side,104,22,16:54:02

Ben Fickes,Yeah sounds perfect :) talk to you then!,40,8,14:33:28
Erica Yee,"We're having early dinner with my dad's parents, but I think I should be free afternoon my time, maybe like 2? (5 for you) would that work?",139,27,13:40:29
Erica Yee,Julia stayed home and my parents low key nodded off at times lol but glad we went,81,17,13:39:36
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure! I know you must be super tired and I know itâs Motherâs Day so no pressure if you canât talk but I would love to :) also major admiration that you can all go to church after getting back so late haha,220,45,12:15:59
Erica Yee,But I should be free later if you want to call?,47,11,11:31:09
Erica Yee,"I'm pretty good. Just read your letter and I love it, thank you so much ð can't talk more now cuz we're going to church soon (though not my parents' home church because then they would be expected to do stuff and they also don't feel like socializing lol)",258,49,11:30:44
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,11:28:54
Ben Fickes,How are you doing haha,22,5,10:44:15
Ben Fickes,It was really good! Talked about Colossians 2. One cool thing Pastor Larry talked about was a friend of his who talked about his struggle with having low self esteem and believing we are all sinful and how in Jesus God can destroy sin but love the sinner,254,48,10:44:10
Erica Yee,How was church?,15,3,10:41:27
Erica Yee,Haha thanks,11,2,10:41:24
Ben Fickes,Whoah would love to talk about it! Glad you got home safe :) hope you can both pee and sleep haha,97,21,10:33:02
Erica Yee,Made it home! I drove us back on 2ish hours of sleep cuz everyone else weren't feeling great but I'm fine,105,21,10:03:17
Erica Yee,"Omg my dad watched spider-verse of his own volition without me suggesting it and said it was ""really something"" lol",115,20,9:03:44
Erica Yee,"Flight was good tho, I watched mission impossible fallout and eighth grade (have thoughts) and read a couple of books",117,20,8:25:21
Erica Yee,More need to pee but we can't get out of our seats haha,55,13,8:24:53
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I hope you can sleep soon,40,9,8:22:52
Erica Yee,Just landed but gotta wait for customs to open,46,9,8:20:31
Ben Fickes,Did you get back okay?,22,5,7:47:05
Ben Fickes,"Sorry for the late reply, Iâm still with Jason. Safe trip and ttyl",68,13,17:55:32
Erica Yee,"On the plane now, ttyl",22,5,17:28:25
Erica Yee,"And literally four people snapped me back ""same"" ðð",57,9,16:44:02
Erica Yee,So much food waste lol,22,5,16:43:43
Ben Fickes,Also loved your snap of Julia haha. And whoah the Lord provides haha,68,13,16:41:41
Erica Yee,"We found burgers at the airport, which is our first meal in about 12 hours. They gave us jumbo American size portions of XL fries and drinks for some reason lol",160,31,16:41:15
Erica Yee,Yeahh,5,1,16:39:14
Ben Fickes,I have not seen it. But I did see the verse! Didnât connect it to you but now I am and thatâs really cool haha,114,25,16:34:24
Erica Yee,Whoa did you see the verse of the day,37,9,16:03:51
Erica Yee,Have you seen it?,17,4,14:55:27
Erica Yee,I thought her fighting and powers were way cooler than his anyway,65,12,14:55:25
Erica Yee,It was fine. I enjoyed it and the effects were pretty cool. But writing was lacking and story was eh,100,20,14:55:04
Ben Fickes,Wait I donât think I knew about that haha. How was it?,56,12,14:48:25
Erica Yee,An ok sounds good,17,4,14:48:17
Erica Yee,Will do. Can't believe I only watched Aquaman during the 14 hours on the way over lol,85,17,14:48:07
Ben Fickes,Yep! Gonna call my family and do laundry,40,8,14:47:36
Erica Yee,Did you say you're mostly chilling tomorrow?,44,7,14:47:19
Ben Fickes,Let me know which ones you read/see on the trip,47,10,14:47:13
Erica Yee,And duly noted haha. There's some other movies I want to watch and books I want to read so we'll see,100,21,14:46:52
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah. Really no pressure at all,34,7,14:46:41
Erica Yee,"Maybe tomorrow, I'll let you know. It's also mother's day so idk..",66,12,14:46:15
Ben Fickes,If you watch it donât think Iâm super weird for thinking itâs funny ð,78,14,14:43:43
Ben Fickes,Okay I canât wait to hear them! If you wanna talk tomorrow or Monday I can but I know you have a lot going on and will be tired so no worries if you canât. And HAHA itâs a pretty weird movie and I still donât know your movie tastes well enough to know if youâd like it. Your call,289,60,14:43:21
Erica Yee,Should I watch Napoleon Dynamite on the plane lol,49,9,14:40:03
Erica Yee,Reminds me I do have some thoughts on being pious and my own faith after visiting Israel that I want to share with you later,124,25,14:39:03
Erica Yee,Oh it's not because I'm pious haha.. the daily readings I try to do is through another app. I just open the youversion app to look stuff up and because of their successful gamification strategy x),196,36,14:38:06
Ben Fickes,Sorry for your loss of streak haha,34,7,14:31:35
Ben Fickes,And one day I read the hardcover Bible instead of the app and lost my streak haha,81,17,14:31:27
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang that's impressive. My streak is not that high haha, it usually gets up pretty high and then I accidentally drop",119,22,14:31:06
Erica Yee,"Oh speaking of snaps, I managed to keep our snap streak up on this trip, but I lost my streak for opening up the bible app each day (for which my streak was 630 lol)",165,35,14:29:10
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,14:27:49
Ben Fickes,I'm also getting lunch with Jason soon,38,7,14:24:21

Erica Yee,Please snap me,14,3,14:23:52
Erica Yee,That is incredible ð,23,4,14:23:30
Erica Yee,omg john,8,2,14:23:23
Ben Fickes,It means John has an urge to cook lots of great food for people. He made a menu haha,84,19,14:19:20
Ben Fickes,Oh hope you have a safe trip!,29,7,14:19:04
Erica Yee,And we just got on the bus! So en route to airport,50,12,14:10:59
Erica Yee,What does that mean lol,23,5,14:10:35
Erica Yee,Oh no you didn't,16,4,14:10:30
Ben Fickes,Idk if I told you but John is hosting a feast tonight,53,12,13:50:44
Erica Yee,Ikr,3,1,12:33:36
Ben Fickes,HAHA also the look on Juliaâs face says it all haha,53,11,11:59:41
Erica Yee,If you look closely you can see the hair my dad accidentally pulled out of Julia's scalp,88,17,11:58:54
Erica Yee,I think this is my fav pic from this trip,41,10,11:58:37
Erica Yee,Haha ok,7,2,10:58:35
Ben Fickes,Have a funny story to tell you about it when we talk,52,12,10:35:04
Ben Fickes,Same haha. One night is only one round though so itâs much faster,67,13,10:34:52
Erica Yee,And nice xD,11,3,10:30:23
Erica Yee,ohh yeah we played mafia so much in middle and high school omg,62,13,10:30:15
Ben Fickes,Also completely unrelated but Josh downloaded the game Iâm working on haha,76,12,10:23:29
Ben Fickes,Have you heard of the game mafia? One night werewolf is a lot like that,71,15,10:23:09
Erica Yee,Ah yay. Never heard of either of those games lol,48,10,10:14:44
Ben Fickes,And Danny lives literally 3 minutes away haha,45,8,10:07:16
Ben Fickes,"It was really good! Lot of people there though, most of whom I didnât know. But a few I did and it was nice to see them again. We played articulate and one night werewolf",172,35,10:06:52
Erica Yee,Did you snap a game night at Danny's? How was that?,51,11,10:03:40
Erica Yee,Hopefully something's open at 11pm haha,39,6,10:03:27
Ben Fickes,Oh wow. I guess this doesnât help for a while but will there be good in the airport?,86,18,10:02:47
Erica Yee,"Just shower all the dead sea salt off haha. We have a few hours left before heading to tel aviv but since it's still shabbat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) there's like no restaurants or stores open in Jerusalem, so idk where we're going to get food",255,47,10:01:57
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Anything youâre doing between now and then? And hope you have a safe flight back,90,16,9:52:28
Erica Yee,"1am Israel time, which is 6pm yours I think",43,9,9:51:16
Ben Fickes,When is your flight tonight?,28,5,9:49:28
Ben Fickes,Okay. Glad youâre all okay and glad your moms okay,52,10,9:49:20
Erica Yee,"We're mainly stressed about getting back to Tel Aviv on our own  to catch the flight tonight, since there's exactly one bus and we need to be on it lol",151,30,9:48:16
Erica Yee,My mom messaged that she's at peace and alright. My sister cried the bus ride back to the hostel from the dead sea (which was so cool btw) but she's ok now,155,32,9:47:30
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,9:46:08
Ben Fickes,Is your family doing alright?,29,5,9:45:35
Ben Fickes,"Okay, got it. Once again Iâm just really sorry",48,9,9:45:21
Erica Yee,"I'm ok, don't need to talk rn but also don't need extra space if that makes sense",81,17,9:44:37
Ben Fickes,"If you need to talk Iâm here to listen, if you need space I wonât ask about it",82,18,9:38:21
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Iâm so sorry. Are you alright?,47,9,9:37:48
Erica Yee,Just wanted to let you know my grandma died last night. My mom's still stuck on the plane at the SF airport rn but my grandma was back at home not at the hospital when it happened so that's good,194,40,8:30:49
Erica Yee,"Ah ok, thanks for telling me and glad you could be there for him",64,14,0:33:40
Ben Fickes,"Know youâre asleep and have a lot going on but wanted to say I met with Victor. He said he was âcrumbling spirituallyâ and talked a lot (in amount, not specificity) about agape and how he wants to cut ties with them. But we had a good talk about faith (and Jesus, very specifically) and I felt like he actually wanted to be there talking with me",351,67,21:06:02
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. Hope she has a safe flight back. And hope the rest of you are doing well too,87,19,17:33:58
Erica Yee,"Ohh I'm not going back early, just my mom in a few hours",56,13,13:11:34
Ben Fickes,"Okay, let me know when you get back and how youâre doing",58,12,12:04:51
Erica Yee,"It's ok, thanks for listening and for your concern. My mom is trying to get an earlier flight back",98,19,11:41:42
Ben Fickes,Iâm really sorry. At least youâll be home soon and can talk to them more easily. Sorry to hear about the family tensions too. Wish I could say more than Iâm sorry about this,179,34,10:37:20
Erica Yee,"I'm alright but family tensions are very high, sigh",51,9,9:15:33
Erica Yee,"Thanks, it's not looking great and where we are in Jerusalem is super packed with tourists and limited reception so it's been crazy hard to call people at home",159,29,9:14:40
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I will be praying. Are you alright? If you want to talk about anything at any point just let me know,115,24,6:34:50
Erica Yee,In other news my mom's mom's caretaker called in the middle of the night and my grandma has a GI bleed so they're putting her on hospice ð¢ prayers that she would not be in pain whatever happens would be appreciated,217,41,2:42:34
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I think it's my fault for trusting them lmao",52,10,2:39:17
Ben Fickes,Personally I think itâs not really your fault at all since you didnât fall through on anything but I know Iâm biased too haha,131,24,18:05:30
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Iâm sorry Erica ð I think you are very justified in asking them to pay a part of it,97,21,18:04:23
Erica Yee,"Ok that was longer than expected lol, thanks for listening ð¬",63,11,16:36:01
Erica Yee,"UGH need to rant. So in leased properties you have to get your own internet service. I took care of it for our apartment and just venmo requested roommates each month. Since Barbara was staying the longest at the end of the semester, I gave her instructions on how to return the equipment. She got the box ready but didn't have time to actually mail it, so she asked Claire and Sophie to since both were going back to move out their stuff last weekend. This week I get several emails from the provider with a new bill for unreturned equipment. Apparently s and c both thought the other had done it but neither actually did it. So now I have an outstanding bill!! Barbara's going to email the housing director to see if they put it somewhere but I highly doubt it. If we can't, I asked them to split the (expensive!) bill since it's basically everyone's fault SIGHH",864,160,16:35:17
Erica Yee,Lemme know when you do!,23,5,14:40:50
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. I have not started a book yet haha. But hoping to do Chichiâs soon,77,16,12:59:06
Erica Yee,Lots of long bus rides,22,5,12:47:05
Erica Yee,"Including Chichi's part 2 and this memoir that I skimmed 60% of, I think I've read 8 books this trip so far lol",111,23,12:46:53
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope you arenât too tired after getting back,54,9,12:40:26
Erica Yee,Early Sunday morning,20,3,8:09:49
Ben Fickes,When do you come back from Israel again?,40,8,7:53:40
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. Iâm telling people Iâm busy Sunday so I can have a day of rest,79,16,7:53:27
Erica Yee,Hope you can find time to rest too,34,8,7:13:21
Erica Yee,Wow look at you xD,18,5,7:13:08
Ben Fickes,Iâve hung out with people in some capacity every day this week after work and itâs so exhausting haha,105,19,6:50:04
Ben Fickes,"Going to gyro city. Never been, apparently itâs near Target",61,10,6:49:37

Erica Yee,Sorry I've had limited wifi. That's great about Roger!,54,9,5:24:35
Ben Fickes,I just had dinner with Roger. It was really good. We talked mostly about games but he asked me about religion. And on the way out we had a surprisingly deep (if brief) talk about friends and our childhoods. Just wanted to let you know it was really good,253,49,20:13:10
Ben Fickes,How was your day?,17,4,12:09:08

Ben Fickes,I canât wait to hear all about it haha,40,9,8:02:46
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs so amazing,24,4,8:02:36
Erica Yee,"It is super cool. You'll see when my snaps and photos send from my other phone later, but already visited the mount of beatitudes today and about to stop in Capernaum",166,31,7:52:04
Erica Yee,Ooh yeah it def can be fatty,28,7,7:51:18
Ben Fickes,My mom was telling someone at church about your trip haha and he went somewhat recently too and was talking about Galilee. It sounds so cool to see all the places from the Bible haha,182,35,6:36:46
Ben Fickes,"So I liked the duck, but I think Iâd prefer less fatty meat on most occasions. And thatâs awesome, have fun!",112,21,6:35:36
Erica Yee,"We're going to the sea of Galilee today, I'm excited",52,10,23:40:08
Erica Yee,Do you have thoughts on duck too? Love it haha,46,10,23:39:29

I fixed a bug today
I got pie for my first day
I got to play a VR game during lunch (Blade and Sorcery)",221,49,18:53:59
Ben Fickes,"Was really good, youâre probably asleep but Iâll tell you more after I call my mom",86,16,18:06:22

Erica Yee,"Also fake news, Victor knows way more geography than me xD but that is wild lmao",80,16,10:21:02
Erica Yee,Omg whaaa,9,2,10:20:45
Ben Fickes,"Whoah my work is next to a Whole Foods, see you there! (jk). You were in my dream last night too (and so was Victor). We were in class and you were talking to the teacher about geography and it was places Victor and I didnât know existed (probably were fake names in my dream haha). Then there was a villain who captured you (sorry guess my dreams revert to tropes) and Victor was helping the bad guy but was also comic relief because all he wanted was to be with his crush and he would sing long songs about it and the villain would come in partway through the songs and for some reason thought they were all about me. Eventually I got to you but then I think the tone kinda shifted and we just hung out. Most of the details I can remember are about Victor being comic relief haha",783,153,7:45:01

Erica Yee,Whereas Jewish food in NY is from eastern Europe,48,9,14:43:52
Erica Yee,"Interesting cuz Israeli food is different from Jewish food we think of in NY etc, since it's influenced from the Jewish diaspora and Mediterranean cuisine",154,25,14:43:39
Erica Yee,But my mom finally woke me up so I could eat and it was fun!,60,15,14:42:21
Erica Yee,Welp I slept through the first 2 hours of the 3 hour cooking class haha,71,15,14:41:52

Ben Fickes,"Someone (older) at my church talked to me about âvideo games being televised nowâ and I started talking to him about esports. But conversation broke down really fast because he didnât know what esports were, he was talking about Ready Player One haha",256,43,10:18:11
Ben Fickes,Hope your nap is good too haha,30,7,9:07:30
Erica Yee,And I will! Should be fun,25,6,9:07:03

Erica Yee,Ok sorry gonna try to nap before we have a cooking class lol,60,13,9:05:48
Erica Yee,Aww I'm glad,12,3,9:05:32
Ben Fickes,I didnât do much haha but I really enjoyed it. Felt relaxing and was good to spend time with my mom and family. Itâll also be good to be back in Boston with so many friends,176,36,9:02:27
Erica Yee,Well I guess a lot of it wasn't technically spent at home haha,62,13,9:01:34
Erica Yee,How was your week at home overall,33,7,9:01:22

Ben Fickes,Oh yeah thatâs right! Howâs that going for him hah,54,10,13:52:16
Erica Yee,It's funny cuz my dad is using messenger on his phone for the first time (since he usually doesn't have a smart phone) haha,123,24,13:51:17
Erica Yee,Oo ok,5,2,13:50:50
Ben Fickes,Yeah was gonna ask about that haha. Well if someone swipes one at least you have a backup,89,18,13:01:10
Ben Fickes,"The character I won as is The Silent (the other two are The Ironclad and The Defect, which I both like more but could not beat it as haha). It unlocks alternate art for all of their cards",187,38,13:00:35
Erica Yee,Yes I'm still bringing my regular phone around too for the good camera tho..this was not well thought out lol,109,20,13:00:33
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Hope itâs good haha. And what a shame haha at least you can still take regular pics,94,19,12:59:44
Erica Yee,Nice!! What's the characters name?,34,5,12:59:03
Erica Yee,"Also got a Sim card but put it in my old phone not my everyday one, and have 1gb for the week, so no Snapchatting except on wifi still lol",138,30,12:58:37
Erica Yee,"We're about to go out for dinner now haha. The hostel breakfast is nice and extensive, all cold food though",107,20,12:57:27
Ben Fickes,Also I beat the secret boss in Slay the spire and am very excited about it. It unlocks the beta placeholder art for the character you win as,140,28,12:56:17
Ben Fickes,Are you doing anything else for the day then? Howâs the food (besides McDonalds haha),87,15,12:55:30

Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs awesome! That you get to bike and your haha. Are your dad and sister doing better?,94,18,12:49:44
Erica Yee,My dad and I just went on a 4 hour bike tour of tel Aviv which was super fun. I feel like more than half of it was our tour guide rambling haha but he was really interesting,173,38,12:26:01
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,12:25:21
Ben Fickes,"And okeydokey, I made a note to remind you :)",45,10,8:17:26
Ben Fickes,Yeah guess the California Girls song must have been written about you,69,12,8:17:09
Erica Yee,Story about Jaffa (to remind me),32,6,7:11:44
Erica Yee,And you have to spend more time  in California to see the real side of me ð,78,17,3:16:20
Erica Yee,thanks for the pics and stories! LOL HAPPY BIRTHDAY that's cute but ahhh,72,13,3:13:49
Ben Fickes,"Thanks for listening, hope (after you get some rest) you and your family have a great start to your trip :)",107,21,21:15:31
Ben Fickes,"Second story is that people were asking about Josh
My uncle Jim: âyouâll have to hear the war stories from Josh when he comes back.â (To me specifically) âI bet he has more for you than for your mom.â
Me: haha yeah
Jim: (shaking his head disapprovingly) âthose California girls are crazy thoughâ
Then I started thinking about you and had a burst of intense laughter haha",384,67,21:15:00
Ben Fickes,So two stories (which I can repeat talking but figured Iâd send in case I forget): first is that my mom and grandma told our waitress so much about my personal life (okay some of it was that after my mom mentioned Iâd be in Boston she said her daughter worked in Boston). And my mom or my grandma said âheâs turning 21 in a couple weeks!â (4 but whatever). Then she brought out cake (and m&ms since Iâm âstill a kid until Iâm 21â) and sang happy birthday and sent merit with kettle corn and Hershey kisses. And my grandma was kinda tipsy and laughing the whole time,583,109,21:11:04
Ben Fickes,"From right to left: me, my mom, my grandma Chris, her sister Shirley (not sure on spelling. Sheâs my great aunt, Iâve seen her I think once before). The my great uncle Jim and my great aunt Anne (Anne is Chris and Shirleyâs sister, and sheâs married to Jim. Think the age order from youngest to oldest is Chris, Anne, Shirley but Iâm not sure)",353,65,21:09:45
Ben Fickes,So I know youâre asleep but wanted to send a pic and a couple stories,71,15,21:09:45
Ben Fickes,"Okay, Iâll definitely check it out soon. Would love to discuss once I read it",79,15,18:39:00
Erica Yee,Yep it's a good ending! I feel like the first half was edited more (like it felt more polished) but still really good,117,23,18:38:36
Ben Fickes,Glad you all arrived safely :),30,6,18:38:08
Erica Yee,Yeah it's 1:30am haha,21,4,18:37:29
Ben Fickes,So wait itâs really late there right? Are you all gonna sleep until tomorrow?,79,14,18:32:29
Ben Fickes,"Wait did you finish all of Chichiâs book? I havenât started yet haha. And Iâm jealous, have never had a flying dream. And oh my goodness glad you are all okay",164,31,18:32:04
Erica Yee,Omg we took a taxi to the hostel and he was going 100mph ðð,65,14,18:29:59

Erica Yee,"Theyre doing better, but thanks!",32,5,18:28:35
Erica Yee,Sorry lost airport wifi,23,4,18:28:00
Erica Yee,"I did sleep some, dreamt I was captain marvel (flying is fun!) and also watched aquaman and read chichi's book and a couple other books",135,25,18:28:00
Ben Fickes,How bad is the allergic reaction? What was it to?,49,10,18:01:05
Ben Fickes,Oh geez Iâm praying for them,30,6,18:00:54
Erica Yee,My sister had some allergic reaction and my dad's leg/back injury is bothering him and he threw up,98,18,17:59:51
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness how are you getting there haha,45,9,17:53:06
Ben Fickes,Did you sleep? And are they sick or just tired?,47,10,17:52:58
Erica Yee,Also my dad low-key gave them yesterday's date for transportation to hostel so idk how were getting there,105,18,17:52:54
Erica Yee,Oops accident,13,2,17:52:31

Ben Fickes,HAHA Iâm glad your mom thinks Iâm so cute ð hereâs the one baby-ish pic I have on my phone:,100,20,8:07:40
Erica Yee,So I showed her the one you sent me and she said you were really cute ðð,78,17,1:28:24
Erica Yee,My mom saw this very light blonde haired boy at the airport and then asked if I had any baby pics of you to see if your hair used to be light lol,145,33,1:28:05
Erica Yee,"Thank you! And no we haven't talked about that before, would love to hear about it",82,16,0:05:52
Ben Fickes,Iâm going to bed now but I hope you and your family have a safe trip and a wonderful time in Israel! I will be praying for you and I canât wait to hear about it :),167,37,23:56:20
Ben Fickes,And the article made me remember those thoughts,47,8,23:55:47
Ben Fickes,Have I talked to you about the imaginary world Servants Sword is based off of and escapism? Can talk to you sometime but Iâve wondered if our engrossment into that world was a product of escapism,197,36,23:55:39
Ben Fickes,"Wow just finished the article. It was a linguist nerding out haha. Thought it was very interesting, definitely not anything Iâve thought about before",151,24,23:54:18
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much for sending this :) Iâll check it out!,58,12,23:38:55
Erica Yee,Whenever you have time,22,4,23:38:38
Erica Yee,I love how it's a linguist just nerding out haha,48,10,23:38:27

Erica Yee,V random but you said I could send you articles haha https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/why-young-adults-are-talking-like-3-year-olds/586000/,159,12,23:38:04
Erica Yee,Hehehe,6,1,23:19:34
Ben Fickes,In terms of enjoyment not ability ð,38,7,23:14:40
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I so badly want to slowly mold how my mom views you via stories (jk ofc). And yes we are on the same page when it comes to sniping haha,145,32,23:14:31
Erica Yee,(don't tell your mom I said that though please ð),52,10,23:11:54
Erica Yee,Sniping though ð,19,3,23:11:35
Erica Yee,Cuz you have to reload so much!,31,7,23:11:24
Ben Fickes,Though I did not like shotgun either,36,7,23:06:10
Ben Fickes,I feel like I switched what I liked as I tried new guns haha,60,14,23:06:01
Erica Yee,I don't like shotguns and b loves them haha,43,9,23:05:35
Erica Yee,Trueee,6,1,23:05:22
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs not bad. And haha ð for me at least trying to figure out ammo was really hard though,99,20,22:58:13
Erica Yee,Though I feel my friendships grew stronger with all the sharing loot ð,73,13,22:50:32
Erica Yee,Ooh that actually makes a lot of sense haha,43,9,22:50:13
Erica Yee,Half an hour ish so not too bad,31,8,22:50:01
Ben Fickes,"Oh which reminds me - I read more about it! Involves travel to multiple planets, and has a mode where levels are balanced (sorry Barbs, youâre not OP anymore) and loot spawns for each players game, not shared between games. But thereâs a classic mode with all the old ways too",280,51,22:45:38
Ben Fickes,Iâd love to play with you too! Just lemme know when if you feel like it sometime (gotta prepare for b3 haha),110,22,22:44:21
Ben Fickes,How much delayed?,17,3,22:44:00
Erica Yee,Lol our flight is delayed a bit cuz of bad weather somewhere en route,69,14,22:37:27
Erica Yee,Yeah I'd love to play that more with you sometime,49,10,22:30:15
Ben Fickes,Thereâs borderlands but feel like thatâs only fun with other people,71,11,22:26:22
Erica Yee,Ah ok :),8,3,22:24:29
Ben Fickes,I do have a few epic games Iâve downloaded and not installed I want to try sometime,85,17,22:23:57
Ben Fickes,I want to wait for you for subnautica haha,42,9,22:23:42
Ben Fickes,Oh really? Feel free to at any point haha. And haha perfect. Hmmm I have some games to look into. I tried one yesterday (Tokyo 42 I think) but you just shoot people on the street so I donât think Iâll play it haha,217,44,22:23:29
Erica Yee,Orrr I don't mind if you play subnautica! Just tell me what happens haha,72,14,22:23:00
Erica Yee,Do you have anything else in your steam backlog,47,9,22:22:25
Erica Yee,Shadow of the tomb raider? XD,29,6,22:20:34
Erica Yee,I've still never watched you play it haha,41,8,22:19:41
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,22:19:32
Ben Fickes,Any recommendations?,20,2,22:12:49
Ben Fickes,But after a few more rounds of that idk,39,9,22:12:44
Ben Fickes,I might play transistor a tiny bit more. And Iâm playing Slay the spire again after so long without playing - itâs out of early access now! They added a new boss but not a ton of other new content,200,40,22:12:09
Erica Yee,Do you have a next game in mind now that you finished transistor?,65,13,22:08:50
Erica Yee,And haha sure,13,3,22:08:34
Erica Yee,Yep!,4,1,22:08:29
Ben Fickes,SF airport right? Maybe someday I can try it or watch you play it to appreciate it haha,87,18,22:06:46
Erica Yee,And HAHA perfect,16,3,22:03:05
Erica Yee,"Hahaha omg that fight was so long. Actually now that I think about it, even though Odyssey is super gorgeous and cool and humongous, I think syndicate is still my favorite AC. I'm such an anglophile lol",202,37,22:02:17
Erica Yee,Yep we're driving to the subway rn,34,7,22:00:55
Ben Fickes,"Also, my aunt made cookies and I wanted a glass of milk to go with them. I didnât look at the glass I grabbed and ended up with this:",135,29,21:55:58
Ben Fickes,He referred to âAtlantisâ as âAtlantaâ throughout his description of the game which was really disorienting haha,120,17,21:55:09
Ben Fickes,So my mom brought up at dinner again that you like AC. My uncle Jim (great uncle but I call them aunt and uncle so using that for shorthand) started talking about AC Odyssey! He talked a lot about the Medusa fight which I could actually engage with from seeing you beat her haha,278,54,21:54:40
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs awesome! Are you going to the airport soon?,55,10,21:53:33
Erica Yee,One of my dad's fellow museum docents just got back from the a trip in Israel with the same tour group and really enjoyed it!,125,25,21:14:50
Erica Yee,ð¬ð¬,8,1,20:26:51
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð I hope youâre not creeped out by this but I didnât even mention you and they asked about you by name? So clearly my mom must have talked you up to all of them haha,177,37,19:09:49
Erica Yee,Please also tell them I try to do my best to be a nice Christian girl in real life ð­ð,91,20,18:52:00
Erica Yee,LOLOL OMG,9,2,18:51:24
Ben Fickes,"My mom has told my entire family here (grandma, great uncle, and two great aunts) that you play assassins creed after learning that earlier today ðð",154,26,18:09:52
Ben Fickes,"Okay, glad heâs okay. Thanks!",31,5,18:09:10
Erica Yee,Hope visiting your great aunt's is good!,40,7,18:04:13
Erica Yee,He's okay. Thanks but don't really have to tell it all to you today,67,14,18:04:01
Ben Fickes,Just got to my great aunts I mean,33,8,18:00:08
Ben Fickes,"I just got to NC, sorry I didnât have reception for a bit",59,13,17:59:59
Ben Fickes,Oh wow. Is he okay? If thereâs anything you wanna talk about via text or call let me know,91,19,17:59:37
Erica Yee,But on the other hand someone needs to nudge him to do other stuff sometimes even when he's super anxious,105,20,17:52:24
Erica Yee,Argh just had a long phone call with Calvin about Lexi stuff. There's way more drama than I knew about before and it's very complicated and sad. Also now I feel slightly bad about shaming him for not going to class and doing homework and stuff when he had all this emotional stress going on,290,55,17:51:55
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha really changes the meaning,46,8,16:47:48
Ben Fickes,*far,4,1,16:47:38
Ben Fickes,Howâs your day been so fat?,29,6,16:47:33
Erica Yee,Haha touche,11,2,16:28:10
Ben Fickes,Christ has existed from the beginning of time so maybe she was just ahead of her time,85,17,16:12:16
Erica Yee,ðð hey Christianity wasn't a thing yet in ancient Greek ok,64,11,16:10:52
Ben Fickes,I can imagine your odyssey character singing the song you sent while stabbing someone,85,14,16:04:39
Erica Yee,DW I listen to Christian podcasts or music while playing,56,10,15:40:31
Erica Yee,LMAO also my parents who don't understand that I like to game,61,12,15:38:27
Ben Fickes,"My mom: âyour uncle Jim games. I donât know what heâs into now. It used to be assassinâs creed.â
Me: âdid you know Erica really likes assassinâs creed?â
Mom: âwhat? But sheâs such a nice girl!â",215,36,15:29:08
Erica Yee,OHH got it,10,3,14:51:29
Ben Fickes,"Oh he said next Thursday or Friday, so I should be free after work",66,14,14:50:53
Erica Yee,Hopefully another time works,28,4,14:50:19
Erica Yee,Ah well haha,12,3,14:50:11
Ben Fickes,"Idk he just asked me if I was free Thursday or Friday, I assume to hang",71,16,14:44:43
Erica Yee,Oh to hang?,11,3,14:43:38
Ben Fickes,Oh Victor reached out to me,27,6,14:39:05
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,14:11:11
Ben Fickes,I donât really drink juice so I told her that haha,52,11,14:09:07
Erica Yee,Aww what do you like haha,25,6,14:08:51
Ben Fickes,Also my grandma just called and asked what kind of juice I like haha (guess Iâm forever a child in her eyes haha),115,23,14:07:40
Ben Fickes,I actually heard about that!,28,5,14:07:11
Erica Yee,Whoaa https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal,114,2,14:05:26
Erica Yee,Actually I don't think I've bought any of the 5 AC games I've played haha. But most were gifts,94,19,14:05:14
Ben Fickes,Dang. Well I guess at least you didnât pay for it haha. Itâs about 5-6 hours I believe,90,18,14:02:33
Erica Yee,How long does it take to get to NC?,35,9,13:46:04
Erica Yee,"And there's too much abstergo stuff for my taste (when you're pulled out of the simulation into the real world), but it was cool when it glitches you from 18th century into 19th century Paris and you get a new setting for a bit",227,44,13:45:57
Erica Yee,But stealth is still pretty janky. The ebemies are sooo sensitive,65,11,13:40:34
Erica Yee,Ok so I got the stealth kill moves finally,42,9,13:40:13
Erica Yee,Ac unity,8,2,13:40:03
Ben Fickes,What game was your snap yesterday from,38,7,8:07:33
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,23:01:16
Ben Fickes,Anyways thanks for laughing at the punchline v2 haha,52,9,22:45:43
Ben Fickes,Clearly what I need most in a relationship is a second autocorrect,66,12,22:45:02
Ben Fickes,"That was actually a test, Erica",31,6,22:44:43
Erica Yee,Sorry guess I can't read all your mistyped texts x),51,10,22:44:23
Erica Yee,HAHA ohh got it,15,4,22:44:07
Ben Fickes,Oh parable haha my b,20,5,22:43:48
Erica Yee,Truth in the what?,18,4,22:43:30
Ben Fickes,Our doorbell rang at 9 pm. Itâs been ringing every day because thereâs a woman who camps out by our house trying to get us to take a survey. My mom always pretends not to be home and she rings like 5 times. Anyways tonight my mom answered so guess thereâs truth in the para le haha,287,57,22:31:42
Erica Yee,Didn't eat it yet haha,22,5,22:31:34
Erica Yee,This fruit tart thing,21,4,22:31:27
Ben Fickes,Oh Whoah! What was the dessert haha,35,7,22:30:36
Erica Yee,We were eating dinner and the doorbell rings and we're like uhh. Turns out to be the pastor. Apparently he had cancelled a meeting that my mom was supposed to be at that she didn't even know was happening lol. But he brought us the dessert he was going to serve at the meeting so yay. Then they talked about church drama and I was just awkwardly standing there ð¬,365,70,22:30:07
Ben Fickes,Oh dang I hope that Monday is VERY restful haha,47,10,22:29:55
Erica Yee,Again* not around,17,3,22:29:28
Erica Yee,"Getting back on Sunday, then my mom is working Monday, then leaving around Tuesday",82,14,22:27:10
Erica Yee,The 14th I think? It's a Tuesday,32,7,22:26:52
Ben Fickes,And when do you go to NC again?,31,8,21:31:44
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,21:11:00
Erica Yee,David and June Tung in Raleigh. He used to teach engineering at UNC chapel Hill,79,15,21:05:49
Erica Yee,"No idea, lemme ask my mom lol",29,7,21:03:21
Ben Fickes,Whatâs your aunts name? In case somehow my great aunt knows her,65,12,20:59:57
Ben Fickes,Yeah little known fact,22,4,20:59:42
Erica Yee,Hahaha oh really,16,3,20:53:41
Ben Fickes,Well you better look hard for it then because NC is a lot bigger than Delaware ð,83,17,20:47:02
Erica Yee,I think we're only gonna be there like one day lol,50,11,20:46:21
Erica Yee,Oh nice! Leave a secret message for me ð,43,9,20:46:07
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you weâre visiting my great aunt in NC tomorrow? My grandma is there too,85,17,20:37:32
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. Hope your packing goes well (and itâs not as much as leaving Boston haha),86,16,20:37:09
Erica Yee,Finally packing now haha,24,4,20:30:00
Erica Yee,Think it's around 11pm,22,4,20:29:54
Ben Fickes,What time is your flight tomorrow?,34,6,20:18:12
Ben Fickes,Wow you can read me like a mistyped text,40,9,20:18:04
Erica Yee,Dw that's how I read it haha,28,7,19:44:13
Ben Fickes,Oh I meant as an atheist interested in history I would not be interested in most of the museum (oops),101,20,19:34:45
Erica Yee,"gotcha, that makes sense",24,4,19:17:31
Ben Fickes,Talking to my mom about it over dinner this is what I would say: I do not imagine that if I were an atheist interested in history I would enjoy most of the museum. But as a Christian I think itâs well done,207,43,19:11:44
Ben Fickes,Of course! Thank you for listening haha,39,7,19:11:00
Erica Yee,Thanks for sharing all that so I could visit vicariously xD,59,11,18:59:25
Erica Yee,Ooh interesting,15,2,18:59:16
Ben Fickes,"Oh one more thing on the museum, there was a little about Christopher Columbus/conquistadors that made me feel âguarded.â It was pretty neutral about their actions if I recall which is good in that it wasnât outright praising them but bad in that it didnât really address the problematic pieces. Anyways fwiw",316,52,18:37:41
Erica Yee,HAHA and idkk,13,3,18:33:58
Ben Fickes,Was the lake walk a meeting or just hanging out ð and wow what did you do to traumatize that child?,102,21,18:31:41
Erica Yee,We saw one of her co-workers with her 1 year old baby around the lake and immediately when the baby saw us she started crying and wouldn't stop ð,148,29,18:30:03
Erica Yee,My day's been good. Went on errands and walking around the lake with my mom.,76,15,18:29:28
Erica Yee,Yep they're behind it,21,4,18:28:03
Ben Fickes,Oh was it funded by them? Had no idea haha. But yeah lemme know whenever you end up getting to it,97,21,18:26:34
Erica Yee,"Gotcha. And yah ofc, I really want to go someday. There's a pretty recent book on the hobby lobby family and how they spend so much of their money on evangelistic stuff that's on my list too. But I rarely read nonfic so probably won't get to it for a while haha",261,52,18:25:10
Ben Fickes,How was your day today?,23,5,18:11:24
Ben Fickes,If you ever go I will be curious to hear your thoughts haha,59,13,18:11:19
Ben Fickes,But I did like it and I did feel like I was being presented with info and not a point of view (besides a definitely Christian lense),132,27,18:11:06
Ben Fickes,And I guess maybe thatâs a part of the Christian audience vibe,64,12,18:10:24
Ben Fickes,So maybe thatâs what part of the criticism is about,53,10,18:09:58
Ben Fickes,Hmmm I remember there was a bit about the transcription of it by scribes. I donât recall anything about the deciding of what books went into the Bible or who wrote what. But I was moving kinda fast at some points haha. There were videos which talked about John and Paul writing the NT briefly and there was some person (animated) talking about commentary on the law and their name was Moses so idk if that was talking about Moses writing parts of the OT or was just a rabbi named Moses and was talking about Jewish tradition and the OT,537,101,18:09:44
Erica Yee,Did it talk about how the Bible came to be?,43,10,18:05:08
Erica Yee,Ooh yes thanks,14,3,18:04:29
Ben Fickes,Hope that helps haha,20,4,17:49:28
Ben Fickes,"I think it assumed the audience was Christian because it definitely presented things like the apostles writing the Bible as if youâd care about it, but I didnât feel like I was being forced to a certain particular Biblical point of view. It definitely wasnât saying things like âbut what if this part of the Bible isnât true?â but mostly it did seem like just giving info about the Bible",399,70,17:49:17
Ben Fickes,"Most of the rest (at least, what I saw) was cultural context of Jesusâs Israel and Rome, archaeological artifacts about the ancient Middle East, and how the Bible is referenced in modern times (which I thought was kinda unnecessary and the least interesting part but whatever)",278,46,17:46:40
Ben Fickes,There was a temporary exhibit on âthe slave Bibleâ which I was worried about going in. But it was very good and talked about what passages were specifically removed/left in from the Bibles given to American slaves in order to keep them obedient and it mentioned something about thinking about the context and time and how that affects how we interpret the word,364,63,17:45:08
Ben Fickes,"First is that I did think it was definitely for a Christian audience - for example, there are video dramatizations of the old and new testaments. I guess those did present things as fact but I think the point was the story so I donât really have an issue with that",266,51,17:42:58
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm so I do have a few thoughts about it, probably all over the place",70,15,17:41:43
Erica Yee,"It's ok if not, just wondering haha",35,7,17:36:45
Erica Yee,Do you have any thoughts on that?,33,7,17:36:37
Erica Yee,"Some of the criticism (from lefty Christians, which is who I follow on Twitter haha) ((beside some sketchy maybe smuggled and not fully authenticated artifacts)) is that the museum doesn't engage visitors to think critically about how we perceive and accept history as truth, especially with how ""facts"" about the Bible are presented",333,53,17:36:23
Erica Yee,Ah yay! I'm glad it was cool,28,7,17:32:56
Ben Fickes,And apparently Pence is gonna be there later,44,8,16:20:41
Ben Fickes,We just finished. It was super amazing. Couple weird things (bible in fashion which was a really weird shirt with Jesusâs face on it?) but altogether it was really amazing. Really good video dramatization of the old and new testaments,236,40,16:03:45
Erica Yee,lol sounds about right,22,4,13:40:05
Ben Fickes,Well jus walked in to the museum to see a swarm of kids in MAGA hats,68,16,11:34:55
Ben Fickes,And thanks for the email! Will try to download tonight,54,10,8:41:48
Ben Fickes,"Donât know what to expect really, but I figure Iâm not doing anything else important rn haha",96,17,8:41:34
Erica Yee,Gnight!,7,1,23:54:15
Erica Yee,Lemme know how it is,20,5,23:54:12
Erica Yee,And omg I want to go!! So much controversy,42,9,23:54:06
Erica Yee,Will try!,9,2,23:53:58
Ben Fickes,Goodnight :),12,2,23:53:37
Ben Fickes,"Also I gotta go to bed, my mom and I are going to the museum of the Bible in DC tomorrow",88,21,23:53:32
Ben Fickes,Okay chrome failed so would you mind sending me a google drive link?,68,13,23:53:13
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,23:51:56
Ben Fickes,It did with edge but it looks like it'll work with chrome,57,12,23:43:38
Erica Yee,Did the Firefox send thing just fail? I can try to do it through Google drive,77,16,23:43:23
Erica Yee,"Saw it, thanks!",15,3,23:43:04
Ben Fickes,"I replied with more songs but that's just because you'll be away for a bit, please don't feel pressured to listen to them if you don't have time anytime soon",157,30,23:39:14
Erica Yee,(Y) (Y),7,2,23:20:35

Erica Yee,praying for him ð¬,20,4,23:10:51
Ben Fickes,Maybe through some chain of events Pat will come back,53,10,23:09:13
Erica Yee,Yeah it's more of what I did 2 years ago with Pat (without him now lol),71,16,23:08:42
Ben Fickes,Hopefully whatever upperclassman/men you mentor can help out too,64,9,23:07:27
Ben Fickes,Well at least you like logistics haha,37,7,23:07:03
Ben Fickes,Oh wow,6,2,23:06:51
Erica Yee,"And even if Parker joins IV ST, he's still gonna be point person for agape worship somehow so don't want to overbook him",120,23,23:05:21
Erica Yee,Chichi and Dan will be helping too ofc but she'll be applying to med schools fall semester and he's also in VT/maybe BCEC,121,23,23:04:42
Erica Yee,Plus hopefully mentoring underclassmen to take up the mantle,60,9,23:04:11
Erica Yee,The logistical and planning stuff,33,5,23:04:00
Ben Fickes,"And thatâs good youâre excited, what exactly will you be doing?",67,11,22:58:32
Ben Fickes,HAHA nice,9,2,22:58:18
Erica Yee,The stepper exercise machine is there xD,40,7,22:47:54
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm excited about next year though I'm gonna be doing a lot more than I did this past semester,99,20,22:47:39
Ben Fickes,Very random but what brought you to your shed earlier haha,58,11,22:43:59
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness that is quite the journey. But Iâm glad you got to talk to them haha,85,18,22:43:29
Erica Yee,Talked for like an hour and a half too omg,42,10,22:42:24
Erica Yee,"So I dialed into my own vid chat through my phone, then hung up on my computer, and we ended up with a nice 3 way phone call xD",127,29,22:42:11
Erica Yee,"Finally I hung up and started a Google meet group (why does gsuite have so many similar products). They each dialed through phone number into my vid chat, but I couldn't hear them for some reason through my computer",215,39,22:41:13
Erica Yee,"Ok so chichi started a Hangouts group for us and Dan and I joined the call, but she herself couldn't join the vid call for some reason. She tried for like 20 mins while Dan and I just sat there haha",198,41,22:40:04
Ben Fickes,Okay haha I am very intrigued,29,6,20:17:36
Erica Yee,It's ok we're good now! Using actual phone calls in a janky way (I'll explain later haha),89,17,20:17:20
Ben Fickes,I'm so sorry,12,3,20:16:38
Erica Yee,Dan chichi and I cannot get a cal to work,41,10,20:03:05
Erica Yee,It's absolutely failing,23,3,20:01:57
Ben Fickes,How was/is it?,14,3,19:32:56
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha,9,2,19:32:51
Erica Yee,Nah worship team,16,3,19:32:42

Erica Yee,Both my dad and I are trying to do conference calls on our iffy internet lol rip,80,17,19:31:24
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,19:31:03
Ben Fickes,Idk who it's by but whoever Weird Al parodied haha,50,10,19:27:12
Erica Yee,Sounds too disturbing for me lol,32,6,19:27:07
Erica Yee,The Coolio song??,17,3,19:26:52
Ben Fickes,So your call haha,17,4,19:26:19
Ben Fickes,"The soundtrack is ""Gangster Paradise""",37,5,19:26:10
Ben Fickes,His hair is electric?,21,4,19:25:47
Ben Fickes,He's super furry,16,3,19:25:42
Ben Fickes,He has human teeth,18,4,19:25:36
Ben Fickes,Like really creepy,18,3,19:25:31
Ben Fickes,It's so unnerving,17,3,19:25:26
Erica Yee,"No, should I haha",17,4,19:25:17
Ben Fickes,Completely unrelated but have you seen the new sonic movie trailer,66,11,19:23:01
Erica Yee,Yeah sad,8,2,19:22:44
Ben Fickes,Oh that does sound pretty fundamental,37,6,19:21:21
Erica Yee,There's no stealth kills from hiding or above?? Maybe I have to unlock it but that's a fundamental part of AC gameplay that I miss,130,25,19:20:59
Ben Fickes,Like outside of controls,24,4,19:17:01
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. How does the gameplay itself compare?,45,7,19:16:53
Erica Yee,It's fun but a bit tough to go back to older controls/graphics after playing two of the newer games haha,104,20,19:15:34
Erica Yee,I started AC unity,18,4,19:14:54
Erica Yee,And ooh nice!,13,3,19:14:24
Erica Yee,Haha ð,9,2,19:14:22
Ben Fickes,"Also, I beat transistor earlier! Think I actually understand (most of) the story haha",85,14,19:08:37
Ben Fickes,I got your email! I already have thoughts reading it but guess I should wait to reply until I listen to the songs haha,118,24,19:08:14
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,16:55:21
Ben Fickes,No worries if you canât!,26,5,16:53:53

Ben Fickes,"If it wonât take 97 hours I would appreciate that, thank you :)",65,13,16:45:29
Erica Yee,I think I have the file if you want me to try to send it,56,15,16:43:55
Ben Fickes,Itâs probably not on Netflix but Iâll check just in case,60,11,16:34:51
Ben Fickes,Okay now I really wanna see it more to discuss with you haha,60,13,16:34:41
Erica Yee,Think I cried haha,18,4,16:29:27
Erica Yee,I thought it was really good and gave me feelings in surprising ways,68,13,16:29:25
Erica Yee,Nice nice,9,2,16:28:12
Ben Fickes,Oh wow that does sound like Iâd like it. What did you think of it?,68,15,16:17:00
Ben Fickes,The guy with the mop is my character and the girl with gold hair is my moms haha,80,18,16:16:48
Erica Yee,And it's a Japanese animated movie about a boy stuck between the human and beast worlds. My roommates and I actually saw it in theaters freshman or sophomore year. What it means to be a father figure is a big theme,214,41,16:15:46
Erica Yee,Aw nice! Who's who again?,25,5,16:14:33
Ben Fickes,Josh made âfan artâ of my momâs and my dnd characters,59,11,15:49:19
Ben Fickes,"I have never seen nor heard of it, whatâs it about?",53,11,15:19:53
Erica Yee,"Since you liked your name, i recommend the boy and the beast. Have you seen it / heard of it?",93,20,15:07:44
Erica Yee,hahaha i'm glad,15,3,13:45:09
Ben Fickes,Not that I know the details of when Iâd visit but point is I am looking forward to it so itâs my pleasure haha,114,24,13:40:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah you know itâs a really tough competition between visiting you and working in an office for 8 hours but *sigh* I suppose it would be a nice change of pace ð,165,32,13:40:31
Erica Yee,ok! seriously thank you for being willing to do that,52,10,13:38:20
Ben Fickes,The short of it is I have to see if Iâm allowed to miss a day of work and that will determine whether July would be an option,127,28,13:29:38
Ben Fickes,Oh which reminds me I have a little more to talk to you about about visiting,76,16,13:29:00
Ben Fickes,Or at Summit haha,17,4,13:28:40

Erica Yee,oh well i give up,17,5,13:27:46
Erica Yee,i think i tried clicking on access shared files or something,60,11,13:27:43

Ben Fickes,Do you know if Victor does that with other guy friends,54,11,13:06:23
Erica Yee,"We didn't talk that long cuz he went to bed but he sent me some screenshots of his conversation with Patrick McGrath that precipitated it, and Victor is clearly trying to push him away while Patrick is trying to be a good friend so ugh",235,45,13:05:25

Ben Fickes,Okay is it okay if I email the songs so we have a chain to refer back to haha,77,19,22:43:02
Ben Fickes,Oh I didnât tell you about that? Yeah that was hilarious haha,63,12,22:42:50
Erica Yee,oh also she mentioned that barbara finally responded to her easter text to you guys hahaha,90,16,22:32:06
Erica Yee,yes ofc!,8,2,22:31:52
Ben Fickes,Oh I forgot to talk to you about this over the phone but are you good if I send you a couple songs? Some of the songs I listen to are kinda sad (like all of NFâs stuff) just as a heads up haha,194,44,22:29:33
Ben Fickes,HAHA next time you can call me to make your mom proud,53,12,22:28:50
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:27:13
Erica Yee,"me: i called ben today

me: well, technically he called me
mom: oh. nvmd then, that's different",125,24,22:26:58
Erica Yee,aw yay i'm glad,15,4,22:26:03
Ben Fickes,Got to talk to Josh over dinner!,32,7,21:27:23
Ben Fickes,Oh sorry we just finished eating my bad. And you did show me! Maybe Iâll check it out with the new quotes haha. And I did not remember either of those quotes so Iâm glad youâve immortalized them haha,205,39,21:27:10
Erica Yee,i'm updating my quote generator personal project (did i show you before?) with books i've read in the last several months and these are the two quotes i highlighted in the entire jonathan strange and mr norrell hahaha,217,38,20:47:18
Erica Yee,Snap me the pizza if you can please,35,8,20:00:30
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,20:00:20
Ben Fickes,I said no haha,14,4,19:58:57
Erica Yee,Haha nice are you gonna drink it?,33,7,19:58:39
Ben Fickes,My mom just offered me beer with dinner?,40,8,19:46:43
Ben Fickes,Yup,3,1,18:33:25
Erica Yee,Ok ready?,9,2,18:32:11
Ben Fickes,Sounds good :),14,3,18:13:06
Erica Yee,let's do phone call,19,4,18:12:53
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! Do you wanna do phone call or some video call?,63,13,18:10:47
Erica Yee,sure can you do in 20 mins ish?,31,8,18:08:30
Erica Yee,looks like i played 8 hours (but i'm relatively slow),53,10,18:08:20
Ben Fickes,"Also, would you like to talk at all sometime today, or do you want to wait for another time?",92,19,18:02:37
Ben Fickes,I am curious to see what it will be. How long is the game?,58,14,18:02:13
Erica Yee,i did like the ending tho (without understanding any of the story hahaha),73,13,18:00:58
Ben Fickes,Why thank you haha,18,4,17:48:28
Erica Yee,very admirable,14,2,17:45:09
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Transistor is pretty good! It is really good graphics and confusing story haha. Trying really hard to figure the story out,133,23,17:41:14
Erica Yee,what did you think of transistor?,33,6,17:38:33
Erica Yee,good! slept 12 hours again haha,31,6,17:38:27
Ben Fickes,How's your day been so far?,27,6,17:04:42
Ben Fickes,Goodnight!,10,1,0:45:43
Erica Yee,"Ok actually going to bed now, gnight!",37,7,0:45:13
Erica Yee,Idk x),6,2,0:44:55
Ben Fickes,Oh wow how did I have no idea this whole time haha,50,12,0:43:10
Erica Yee,Basically unofficial brand of our city,38,6,0:42:22
Erica Yee,Oh no it's oaklandish haha,26,5,0:42:08
Ben Fickes,Isn't the sweater an Alethia one? Or did I assume that incorrectly for some random reason haha,94,17,0:39:59
Ben Fickes,Yep! Though I wanna tell you about my other story idea too. And thank you so much for sharing these :),102,21,0:39:40
Erica Yee,"Oh yeah here's a few pics from today, first is with Tiffany, second is Leah and I happen to be wearing matching sweaters haha",125,24,0:39:06
Erica Yee,Oh nice! Reviving water?,24,4,0:38:37
Ben Fickes,I'm actually writing rn haha,28,5,0:37:24
Ben Fickes,Whoah way to go on all the driving! Hope you sleep well! If you wanna talk tomorrow lemme know :),97,20,0:37:09
Erica Yee,Ok sorry think I'm actually gonna sleep now LOL I'm so tired from waking up early and driving 3 hours today,107,21,0:36:21
Erica Yee,Omg yes the lines were so long,30,7,0:35:51
Ben Fickes,I remember I didn't know whether to follow you around the store or leave without you so I did neither and awkwardly waited outside haha,135,25,0:35:36
Erica Yee,Ooh maybe!,10,2,0:35:30
Ben Fickes,Was it after volunteering somewhere,35,5,0:35:14
Erica Yee,At least once together for some reason,38,7,0:34:27
Erica Yee,No I'm pretty sure we went to the one by your work,50,12,0:34:20
Ben Fickes,Did we go to a different one?,29,7,0:32:24
Erica Yee,Got it,6,2,0:32:15
Erica Yee,Oh yeah that sorry I was not helpful haha,41,9,0:32:12
Ben Fickes,The one by my work was on 6th,29,8,0:32:08
Ben Fickes,Oh I see the location now,25,6,0:32:01
Erica Yee,That we went to in New York,27,7,0:31:59
Ben Fickes,Wait what trader joes,21,4,0:31:40
Erica Yee,Wait no that was lower near your work,37,8,0:31:14
Erica Yee,Is that the trader Joe's we went to?,36,8,0:30:59
Erica Yee,Ikr,3,1,0:30:53
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness that's funny and terrible,40,7,0:24:49
Erica Yee,Also while we're not in NY omg,30,7,0:24:02
Erica Yee,Ikr,3,1,0:23:51
Ben Fickes,wow look what we're missing while not in boston,47,9,0:20:36
Erica Yee,https://www.boston25news.com/news/mit-hackers-turn-great-dome-into-captain-america-s-shield/944249881,101,1,0:19:39
Ben Fickes,And yeah I really liked Ant Man's character/acting,50,8,0:16:59
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Actually on that thought, one of the very interesting/troubling things on that was in infinity war how it says definitively via the soul stone that Thanos loved Gamora",175,29,0:16:45
Erica Yee,He also said he thought ant man seemed like the best actor which I sorta agree with,83,17,0:14:35
Erica Yee,Uh part of it I think,21,6,0:13:54
Ben Fickes,Like he didn't like that it was part of the story or how it was presented/addressed?,84,16,0:12:12
Erica Yee,(good thing he didn't watch infinity war then yikes),52,9,0:11:17
Erica Yee,Oh that reminds me the other thing my dad said was he didn't like the thanos cruel father stuff,95,19,0:11:01
Erica Yee,Oh yeah he was a more complex villain in infinity war,53,11,0:10:25
Ben Fickes,But that changed in this one which made him seem like a weaker villain,70,14,0:08:25
Ben Fickes,Oh one random thing is that I think what made Thanos such a good villain in infinity war was that he believed what he was doing was right and it was impersonal,159,32,0:08:11
Ben Fickes,I did not even keep track of the timeline haha but that's a good point I definitely did not notice,98,20,0:07:37
Erica Yee,LOL don't encourage me to,25,5,0:06:53
Erica Yee,And I guess you could have a kid at that age but dang,53,13,0:06:38
Erica Yee,"But he's having Tony Stark in 1970ish, why doesn't he look older",64,12,0:05:56
Ben Fickes,"Oh no if you're obsessed with dates I should've picked better ones (I'm sorry, bad joke but had to make it)",107,21,0:05:21
Erica Yee,Howard Stark was a scientist in the first captain America movies right? Which is in the 40s,91,17,0:05:14
Erica Yee,Also this is getting really nitpicky but you know I'm obsessed with dates/time periods,86,14,0:04:43
Ben Fickes,But I really do like him better,31,7,0:02:45
Ben Fickes,I mean I'm sure that was a big part of their thought process,60,13,0:02:32
Erica Yee,Also they get points for promoting a black guy right haha,57,11,0:02:09
Erica Yee,Ooh that's true,15,3,0:01:50
Ben Fickes,And I guess so,14,4,0:00:53
Ben Fickes,Like you said Bucky needs to do more than just shoot a gun haha,63,14,0:00:38
Ben Fickes,"I was mentally prepared/expecting Bucky to be next cap so was surprised. But honestly I like Sam a lot more than Bucky, because Sam helped people with PTSD and Bucky is just now not evil haha",191,36,0:00:23
Erica Yee,"Well that's what ""WandaVision"" had to be right?? Hope it's them gallivanting around Europe lol",94,15,23:59:34
Erica Yee,What did you think of Sam as the next captain America instead of Bucky (WHO NEEDS TO BE MORE INTERESTING THAN JUST SHOOTING A MACHINE GUN omg)?,143,27,23:59:02
Ben Fickes,And oh so it'll just take place in the past? Guess they can always do that haha,79,17,23:58:28
Ben Fickes,I guess I can see during the five years because there was no foreseeable goal but he did seem a mess after too,110,23,23:58:08
Erica Yee,There's like always a rumor black widow will get her own movie.. personally would not like to see her Russian tortured childhood backstory but oh well,150,26,23:57:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah but in infinity war he blamed himself for what happened to the asgardians and that prompted him to go build the axe and stuff,130,25,23:57:24
Erica Yee,LOL I'm glad,12,3,23:56:52
Erica Yee,"Well in infinity war he had a chance to stop thanos but hit him in the heart not the head right? So he feels really guilty I guess, idk",135,29,23:56:39
Ben Fickes,And she says she can see it having met your family,50,11,23:56:31
Ben Fickes,I told my mom and she's laughing out loud,41,9,23:56:20
Ben Fickes,HAHA that's hilarious,21,3,23:56:13
Erica Yee,And that was that lol,21,5,23:55:26
Erica Yee,"My dad doesn't like to give straight answers so my mom gives up And asks ""easy"" questions, so:
Mom: did the movie engage you the whole time?
Dad: no",148,29,23:55:21
Ben Fickes,Okay that's all my thought on your thoughts haha,48,9,23:51:56
Ben Fickes,"And I thought they were gonna have hawkeye die, his daughter become the next hawkeye (because of ""nice shot, hawkeye""), and black widow was gonna get her own movies eventually. But guess not",190,33,23:51:47
Ben Fickes,Did find Fortnite bit really funny but still from a story standpoint it felt weird to me,88,17,23:50:49
Ben Fickes,Was so confused on Thor because he just seemed very different from infinity war,79,14,23:50:25
Ben Fickes,"Yeah on the women shot I thought ""what would be great is if they had developed relationships that made this about them being a team, like cap and iron man, rather than cramming all the women together""",200,37,23:49:34
Ben Fickes,"Okay on captain marvel, Thanos couldn't hurt her except with the power stone. So who is she gonna fight in her next movies? Like I know they'll make it work but as it is now I cannot envision a scenario where she faces an actual challenge",238,46,23:48:20
Ben Fickes,"Oh just reminded me, curious what your dad thought after seeing none of the others haha",87,16,23:47:16
Erica Yee,Ok what are your thoughts on my thoughts x),43,9,23:45:32
Erica Yee,Throughout the whole movie my mom kept asking me who people were (including Thor and black widow hahaha),104,18,23:45:01
Erica Yee,Especially about iron man's funeral vs black widow's nothing,60,9,23:44:39
Erica Yee,My dad read this before watching and yikes facts https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/avengers-endgame-female-representation-black-widow.html,138,10,23:43:56
Ben Fickes,I have thoughts on your thoughts but wanna give you time to finish if you're not done because I sent a lot haha,111,23,23:43:18
Erica Yee,"At least Valkyrie was back being badass, even if I think Thor is hella lazy (ok go find yourself in guardians 3 that's fine)",124,24,23:41:56
Erica Yee,I also complained about the all women shot!! Like what if they had more screentime (or even *gasp* their own movies haha) in the first place?? But whatever,155,28,23:39:44
Erica Yee,What's the point of being OP if you can't hurt thanos when it counts lol,72,15,23:38:02
Erica Yee,OK CAPTAIN MARVEL DISAPPOINTED ME,33,5,23:37:38
Ben Fickes,No worries haha,15,3,23:16:38
Erica Yee,Yeah it was definitely fan service. Like rewarding loyalty for the last decade of watching. But wish they. could've showed the reappeared avengers fighting their specialties more... sorry gotta drive now will read and finish later,230,36,23:15:57
Ben Fickes,Sorry that was a lot but think Iâm done now haha,50,11,23:15:31
Ben Fickes,All the marvel women in one shot felt like a PR stunt but maybe it matters for others in which case I should not be one to judge,128,28,23:14:52
Ben Fickes,But I liked the end fighting and the whole âfinal battleâ,61,11,23:14:12
Ben Fickes,And the gomorra switching sides,31,5,23:13:57
Ben Fickes,Also while time travel business leaves me with so many questions,64,11,23:13:49
Ben Fickes,Half Hulk was weird and idk why they did that,45,10,23:13:28
Ben Fickes,Thought no one properly addressed black widows death,52,8,23:13:19
Ben Fickes,Capt marvel felt super overpowered again haha,45,7,23:13:07
Ben Fickes,Oh backing up I thought it was good but not as good as I was expecting (probably because of all the hype),105,22,23:12:47
Ben Fickes,"And on the captain America ending, I called it!!! You can ask RenÃ©e, I told her when I ran into her that once âthey might have cap live a normal life out in the past with the womanâ",186,38,23:12:26
Ben Fickes,Okay I feel like Iâm still thinking about it but I second the more fighting less talking. I think part of it was that there were so many characters the talking bits felt kinda crowded to me. As I type this I think part of it is I feel like this should be more of a finale since they had the character development opportunity in all the other movies?,351,69,23:11:45
Erica Yee,What did you think?,19,4,23:08:07
Erica Yee,His first movie will always be my fav (sucker for historical movies),68,12,23:08:03
Erica Yee,Really liked the very end with captain America though,53,9,23:07:41
Erica Yee,I thought it was unnecessarily long and wish there was more fighting less talking (why I want to see superhero movies lol),122,22,23:07:22
Erica Yee,HAHA I cried a lot,18,5,23:06:49
Ben Fickes,What were your thoughts on it?,30,6,22:46:40
Ben Fickes,Read that at first as âwept my bladder was fineâ as in you cried so much you didnât have to pee,101,21,22:46:31
Erica Yee,Welp my bladder was fine haha,29,6,22:00:04
Ben Fickes,"Yep, enjoy! And no pressure but Iâd love that :)",50,10,18:23:37
Erica Yee,Talk to you afterward! Maybe we can call tomorrow,49,9,18:23:10
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð your dad knows exactly what you need I guess,54,11,18:21:46
Erica Yee,My dad brought a tissue box for us lol,38,9,18:20:06
Erica Yee,"Ok will try, thanks x)",22,5,18:19:46
Ben Fickes,"Hopefully saying this does not make things backfire for you but my mom read something that said âif you absolutely have to go to the bathroom, go while the Hulk is eating lunch, and whatever you do donât go in the last hourâ",230,43,18:18:16
Ben Fickes,Haha ð better get it all out of your system. And oh nooooo donât miss endgame haha,87,17,18:17:24
Erica Yee,Had salty Mexican food for lunch so drank so much water omg regrets,67,13,18:17:09
Erica Yee,I'm about to go to the bathroom twice in half an hour at the theater before the movie,85,18,18:16:47
Ben Fickes,Haha whoah that would be wild. And gotcha. Glad she felt good then,66,13,18:16:06
Erica Yee,She felt really good afterward. Her mom did not come which was relieving for her,80,15,18:15:19
Erica Yee,Then we went to lunch and my mom tried to recruit her to her clinic so we'll see what happens there lol,103,22,18:14:57
Ben Fickes,Oh wow I would love to hear more details sometime! How was Tiffany? Did her mom come?,85,17,18:14:30
Erica Yee,I teared up haha,16,4,18:14:06
Erica Yee,It was so good! My mom cried,28,7,18:13:58
Ben Fickes,I know youâre about to see endgame but how was the baptism?,61,12,18:13:36
Erica Yee,ð thanks I will,18,4,11:17:44
Ben Fickes,"If you think itâs appropriate, please tell Tiffany congratulations on her baptism and Iâm so happy for her",110,18,11:05:01
Ben Fickes,I showed that to my mom and she said âhaha I like thatâ,59,13,9:10:30
Ben Fickes,HAHA nice,9,2,9:10:06
Erica Yee,Going through all the best dank Christian memes I missed and,60,11,0:37:44
Erica Yee,Ikr x),6,2,0:06:01
Ben Fickes,Too bad we couldn't have told the guy at baggage check how to fix it haha,73,16,0:03:34
Erica Yee,Probably not permanently fixed but oh well haha,47,8,0:02:51
Ben Fickes,Wow thatâs amazing haha,25,4,0:00:07
Erica Yee,My dad messed with the handle mechanism from inside the suitcase,64,11,23:54:07
Erica Yee,And yeah ofc!,13,3,23:53:54
Erica Yee,LOL so true,11,3,23:53:52
Ben Fickes,If you donât mind,19,4,23:48:14
Ben Fickes,Also please let me know how the baptism is tomorrow and how Tiffany is,70,14,23:48:09
Ben Fickes,Ooh so technically itâs impossible for us to spoil it for each other,70,13,23:47:42
Erica Yee,And HAHA nice,13,3,23:43:46
Erica Yee,6:30 your time,14,3,23:43:41
Ben Fickes,Also I just showed my mom the Japanese folding and she was very impressed haha. Thank you for teaching me :),108,21,23:38:36
Ben Fickes,What time for you?,18,4,23:38:12
Ben Fickes,7:30 I think,12,3,23:38:03
Erica Yee,What time?,10,2,23:32:42
Erica Yee,Oh yay ok,9,3,23:32:39
Ben Fickes,Did I tell you weâre seeing it tomorrow night?,48,9,23:25:46
Ben Fickes,Oh I like grid based. Sheâs seen it before she just wanted a refresher haha,77,15,23:25:33
Erica Yee,What did your mom think of infinity war haha,44,9,23:14:10
Erica Yee,It's grid based,15,3,23:13:53
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha! I havenât played it but downloaded it,50,9,23:12:44
Erica Yee,"sorry getting your messages out of order (and might be sending mine at weird times) but i actually played transistor! so pretty, esp the music, but didn't follow the story at all lmao",183,33,20:50:26
Erica Yee,no worrie,9,2,20:50:03
Erica Yee,it's very good as expected,26,5,20:49:54
Ben Fickes,âHappily ever exileâ love it haha. And what do you think of that one? Also watching infinity war now so may not reply for a bit,131,26,20:43:51
Erica Yee,yes they do in happily ever exile in france,43,9,20:43:06
Erica Yee,"new one is ""on the come up"" by the author of ""the hate u give."" same setting but different characters/plot. about 16 y/o girl who wants to make it big as a rapper",162,33,20:42:54
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Do they end up together haha,36,7,20:41:25
Erica Yee,"it's about a plot to assassinate queen elizabeth but the stakes never feel actually high and dangerous. plus the way they talk doesn't feel ""authentic"" to the time period (though what do i know about 1600 london lol)",216,38,20:40:44
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah you told me about good will hunting. What made you not recommend the Elizabethan one? And what new book?,112,21,20:34:35
Erica Yee,it was fine. very turbulent. i watched good will hunting and then finished the elizabethan book (would not recommend) and read half of a new one,144,26,20:33:56
Ben Fickes,I guess if thatâs the case itâs not the worst then,54,11,20:33:54
Erica Yee,idk i hope so??,15,4,20:33:26
Erica Yee,advanced writing in the disciplines,35,5,20:33:19
Ben Fickes,"We did haha :) and oh man, is it the 44 minute thing? If you havenât you should consider getting transistor, itâs the free epic store game right now",152,29,20:33:14
Erica Yee,also our internet is iffy as usual so may not be able to do co-op games. gonna try to download some singleplayer ones which may take entire days,144,28,20:32:25
Erica Yee,LOL we made that one correctly!!,32,6,20:32:16
Ben Fickes,"If not, how was it? And oh dang... whatâs AWD? And is he still graduating?",76,15,20:31:34
Erica Yee,victor called me to tell me that he didn't do his last AWD assignment yet and then didn't want to talk about it ð,116,24,20:31:11
Ben Fickes,Thatâs good! Did I ever ask how your flight was haha,54,11,20:31:09
Ben Fickes,"And leave out half the ingredients, per usual",45,8,20:30:56
Erica Yee,it's been good. read some and unpacking now,43,8,20:30:25
Erica Yee,you should make it for her haha,31,7,20:30:16
Ben Fickes,Also completely random but people are posting their games and social justice final projects today so I have no idea whatâs up with the deadline haha,150,26,20:29:42
Ben Fickes,"Thanks :) Iâm gonna give it to my mom, she asked for it after I told her about it. And dang you must be super exhausted haha. Howâs your day been so far?",157,33,20:28:45
Erica Yee,also i took another nap ðð,32,6,20:28:23
Erica Yee,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018570-chinese-stir-fried-tomatoes-and-eggs,80,1,20:27:50
Erica Yee,haha yess,9,2,20:27:47
Ben Fickes,Do you have that egg and tomato recipe by any chance?,53,11,20:22:58
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope you can enjoy time relaxing with them then,55,10,15:29:42
Erica Yee,Nope nothing today I think,26,5,15:28:35
Ben Fickes,Do you have any stuff planned for today with your family?,57,11,15:24:42
Ben Fickes,Haha hope it works out,22,5,15:24:24
Erica Yee,My dad installed a fan in our upstairs bathroom that he says will help move air when Julia's doing her nails but hopefully will also move air when he hangs up his wet running clothes lol,186,36,15:23:21
Erica Yee,Thank you,9,2,15:21:43
Ben Fickes,No problem. Iâll pray for her,31,6,15:11:13
Erica Yee,Yeah :/ thanks,14,3,15:10:29
Ben Fickes,I have no idea what her mom is like but hopefully she will see God at work in Tiffany and come around,101,22,15:07:39
Ben Fickes,Iâm so sorry to hear that. Even though itâs not the same as her mom Iâm glad she has people like you to be there with her,127,27,15:06:48
Erica Yee,Real life sorry. Just happened so now my mind is there as I try to talk to her,78,18,15:05:55
Ben Fickes,Wait is this your dream still or real life,42,9,15:05:31
Erica Yee,And then my friend Tiffany who's getting baptized tomorrow just messaged me that she invited her non Christian mom to her baptism and then got bombarded with really negative questions about what being a Christian means and can you get out of it still after you get baptized. Then in the end her mom never gave her an answer about visiting. So now she's feeling super discouraged and afraid :(,392,70,15:03:58
Ben Fickes,HAHA this is already so good,28,6,15:01:54
Erica Yee,"The one I remembered was my mom and I visited the elementary school that my high school used to be part of. It's now called coastline Christian School (they stripped the Chinese but had to keep the C for branding purposes, my high school decided on ""crosspoint"" ð), and my mom went up and asked the principal what it meant to be a Christian pretending like she was a stranger",378,70,15:01:24

Erica Yee,True ð,9,2,17:20:42
Ben Fickes,Well if you ever need to masquerade as a masters student you have a plausible alibi,83,16,17:15:41
Erica Yee,"It's fine, there's like no one here outside the program (it's open to all khoury people) so I'll probably be in many photos yikes",129,24,17:14:03
Erica Yee,"The head professor was legit like ""put your presentation on a USB"" ?!?!",71,13,17:13:01
Ben Fickes,Haha technical difficulties aside how is the event?,51,8,17:12:37

Erica Yee,but i told the teacher i was waiting my whole life for this class which i think he appreciated lol. he's moving from snell (he's currently the dataviz specialist/consultant) to be a visiting assistant professor in camd next year!! definitely deserves it,253,42,21:34:04
Erica Yee,we had to make it mobile responsive and everything started breaking,67,11,21:33:04
Erica Yee,it was a mad dash,17,5,21:32:49
Ben Fickes,How was last coding class btw?,30,6,21:32:33
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Way to go on that,26,7,21:32:24
Erica Yee,but at least i got a good grade on the crossing time study report! in which i did most of the work lol,102,23,21:31:29
Erica Yee,yah,3,1,21:28:17
Ben Fickes,Wait a new rubric for the assignment due tomorrow???,52,9,21:27:41

Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,21:26:40
Ben Fickes,"Idk, I know she co oped at the same place twice and I think at one point she was talking about trying to work there? But idk for sure",133,29,21:25:56
Erica Yee,yeah the worst part of college is people leaving,48,9,21:23:30
Erica Yee,what's she doing after grad?,28,5,21:23:20
Erica Yee,aww,3,1,21:23:17
Ben Fickes,Iâm already thinking about when we graduate and how sad thatâs gonna be though,82,14,21:20:33
Ben Fickes,"Well glad to hear that :) senior send off was good. Kinda sad but when I was trying to say goodbye to RenÃ©e she was like âyouâre living with Shem this summer, itâs not goodbyeâ so at least thatâs one less person to say goodbye to. Slideshow was really good too",271,51,21:20:14
Erica Yee,How was senior send-off?,24,4,21:18:06
Erica Yee,It's fine. I still love this group cuz we had so much fun,57,13,21:18:01
Erica Yee,Yeah the extra thing was not my part lol but the person whose it was had not written ANY of their self eval yet,111,24,21:17:35
Ben Fickes,And Iâm glad you can make it better for your portfolio,56,11,21:16:07
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad you at least got to submit it,40,9,21:15:56
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,21:15:37
Erica Yee,I'm still gonna mess with the project in github even tho it's technically done cuz there's so much we didn't fix and I want this on my portfolio lol,148,29,21:08:47
Erica Yee,Did not proofread the latter at all omg,39,8,21:08:11
Erica Yee,I had to add one more code element to the group project and also write/submit my self evaluation/critique,105,18,21:07:42
Erica Yee,I submitted 8:39 and it was due 840,35,8,21:06:29
Erica Yee,The group project,17,3,21:06:17
Ben Fickes,Which assignment was that?,26,4,21:02:53
Erica Yee,I've never submitted anything this late,39,6,20:45:08
Erica Yee,Omgomgomgomg,12,1,20:45:01
Ben Fickes,Nvm everyone is leaving haha,28,5,20:39:39
Ben Fickes,"People are hanging out at Forsyth 150 after for a âparty.â Idk how long Iâll stay but if you wanna try to see the seniors after class they might be there, idk how long itâll go",184,36,19:09:58
Ben Fickes,"If all goes according to plan I will have *exactly* 100 hours after Thursday. Probably looks really sketchy, especially that my last time slot is going to be 7.5 hours haha oh well",180,33,17:35:01
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,17:01:48
Ben Fickes,You're welcome. You may have researched smart phone technology but clearly I have an extensive internal database of food research,129,20,16:59:31
Erica Yee,I will will just go to qdoba,28,7,16:57:41
Erica Yee,Thank you for your helpful information,38,6,16:57:38
Erica Yee,That would be a no,18,5,16:57:25
Ben Fickes,I screwed up my grammar haha just consider it a burrito for edibility purposes,78,14,16:57:10
Ben Fickes,"Well it's all about your standards haha. I would say think if you would feel comfortable eating a burrito in class then yes, if not no",134,26,16:55:35
Erica Yee,Is Amelia's quesadillas eat-in-class-able,41,4,16:54:56
Erica Yee,Ugh I should get dinner to bring to class but not hungry yet,60,13,16:54:34
Erica Yee,Gotcha thanks,13,2,16:54:14
Ben Fickes,I'll send you the slides and my (probably unhelpful) personal notes,67,11,16:48:46
Ben Fickes,Btw psych is over and honestly schizophrenia made me think of Victor too but I have only interacted with him once so I am probably mostly projecting,148,27,16:48:21
Ben Fickes,that'll show them,17,3,16:47:41
Erica Yee,ok my prof thought this study would be boring and obvious but HA it is not,74,16,16:47:01
Ben Fickes,OH I gotcha haha wow thatâs actually very unexpected to me,60,11,16:45:36
Erica Yee,no the data is actual-estimated. i just wrote estimated-actual for the x-axis label,83,13,16:45:04
Ben Fickes,Wait so the graph is flipped?,29,6,16:44:38
Erica Yee,that's why i kept correctin gyou LOL,36,7,16:44:31
Erica Yee,i just labeled it wrong,23,5,16:44:15
Erica Yee,omg it is overestimated,23,4,16:44:12
Ben Fickes,Congrats on your experiment haha,32,5,16:43:22
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs really interesting, all the findings",45,6,16:43:13
Erica Yee,"mean difference for control ~45 vs. for treatment ~5, so telling people the average definitely helped",101,16,16:42:23
Erica Yee,yep underestimate HAHA,22,3,16:38:59
Ben Fickes,You said overestimated haha,27,4,16:38:20
Erica Yee,wait lol,8,2,16:38:11
Erica Yee,yeah i meant overestimated haha,31,5,16:37:50
Erica Yee,oh wait did i do this wrong,27,7,16:37:00
Ben Fickes,Right but wouldnât that mean they underestimated?,51,7,16:36:58
Erica Yee,negative number means their estimated number < actual number,60,9,16:33:54
Erica Yee,telling people was the treatment,32,5,16:33:30
Ben Fickes,"Oh whoah, that's really interesting. So wait telling people was the control? Or am I reading the graph wrong?",109,19,16:32:52
Erica Yee,"when we told people the average of 80, they tended to overestimate themselves",77,13,16:30:10
Erica Yee,whoa,4,1,16:29:29
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,16:23:00
Ben Fickes,"The slide we started on as you sent your first slide is on schizophrenia. Thanks for sharing, maybe we can talk in person sometime. I can share the slides with you sometime too",176,33,16:15:31
Erica Yee,ok that was less brief than i expected but thanks for listening haha,68,13,16:12:58
Erica Yee,"2. march 2018 my family visited for spring break. that first weekend barbara got baptized, which we all attended (most iv people were on serveup so i'm glad they could support her). my parents took a bunch of my friends out to lunch afterward and victor came too. this was just after he got back from his trip to europe/middle east. and my mom actually commented to me that he seemed like he had PTSD because he had kinda shell-shocked affect",442,81,16:12:50
Erica Yee,"1. have talked to him a bit about mental health since he studies schizophrenic brains. sometimes i wonder if he thinks about if he has symptoms (not for schizophrenia, but maybe depression/anxiety) but idk",205,34,16:08:27
Erica Yee,2 brief thoughts:,17,3,16:07:08
Erica Yee,oh interesting,14,2,16:07:02
Ben Fickes,Very random but we are learning about bipolar disorder in psych. It's a general depressed state with occasional manic episodes. One symptom of a manic episode is going on spontaneous trips. And it made me think of Victor. Anyways that's it just wanted to share,260,45,16:01:36
Erica Yee,ofc haha,8,2,15:47:01
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening haha,25,4,15:40:45
Erica Yee,oh yikes ok,11,3,15:40:22
Ben Fickes,He's supposed to load and render characters. He rendered background already so I think it's mostly the same thing so I don't see why it's that bad but oh well,158,30,15:35:59
Erica Yee,what's his part at a high-level? (if you have time),51,10,15:34:23
Erica Yee,ahh i see,9,3,15:34:05
Ben Fickes,I told him if he could do it that would be preferred but if I go to make the trailer and it's not there I'll implement it,121,27,15:32:26
Ben Fickes,Have more thoughts because I have time to focus on this now only because I worked so much on other work nonstop and again I know he parties a lot but oh well I guess I have time to help,185,40,15:32:04
Ben Fickes,He says he's busy with other work which I get,45,10,15:31:13
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm he did a bit yesterday, but he asked if I could do the section he had been ""assigned""",90,19,15:31:03
Erica Yee,what do you even say to that,28,7,15:30:32
Erica Yee,like all of it?,15,4,15:30:28
Erica Yee,omg,3,1,15:30:23
Ben Fickes,One of my group member asked if I could do his section of work for him,70,16,15:24:31
Erica Yee,yeah ð¬,9,2,15:21:16
Ben Fickes,Geez well Iâm glad you at least have something to work with and I guess itâs not your fault if itâs bad,109,22,15:16:49
Erica Yee,"update: the third group member uploaded his data so we have enough to the analysis now. however, he didn't use the google form so i'm very dubious about the source of this data (but not going to think about it too hard lol)",223,43,15:15:29
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,14:38:03
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Time slot is 10:30-12:30 but it's the same as other exams which usually take 30-45 minutes,99,18,14:35:22

Erica Yee,It's a very important day,25,5,14:11:16
Erica Yee,LOL same,8,2,14:11:10

Erica Yee,Thanks for sharing x),21,4,9:12:55
Erica Yee,LOL WHAT,8,2,9:12:15
Ben Fickes,"Also, I had a dream that you were in last night. It was like we were dating in high school but went to different high schools and I remember Dara (why is he in my dream again haha) and one of my friends from high school giving us advice on how often to spend time together. And I remember I went to âyour schoolâ (and clearly I donât know what your high school is like) and I was designated âSpider-Manâ because of my red hoodie, and there was a game where everyone at the school was trying to catch me. And the only other thing I remember is that I was cooking with my friend Chris at one point and he kept touching raw chicken with various kitchen utensils and then putting them away",695,134,9:11:55
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. At least you have time to nap now if you want haha. How are you feeling?,81,18,9:07:51
Erica Yee,And my bad group member cancelled because he couldn't fall asleep last night and therefore can't meet at 11.. (so we're not meeting anymore I guess),148,26,7:59:47
Erica Yee,Made it to class haha,21,5,7:58:31

Erica Yee,And I'm scared what my group members will commit if I'm not there lol,69,14,11:25:31
Erica Yee,Ugh I'm trying to think of there's any way I could drop by iv senior night but I really can't since we need the whole class to finish our project,145,30,11:23:20
Erica Yee,Oh yeah isn't it for next year's ST?,36,8,11:22:41
Erica Yee,Whaaa she lives so far away doesn't she,39,8,11:22:25

Erica Yee,"Going to cvs now, not ready for confrontation lol",49,9,11:03:11
Erica Yee,"Kk I might come earlier, depends on when group meets till",57,11,11:02:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think we can probably do it in that time!,48,11,10:54:09
Erica Yee,Do you think 430 would be enough time?,38,8,10:49:13
Erica Yee,"Let's see, we have to bake for 60 mins",38,9,10:48:44
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good! Do you know roughly when youâd like to come over? So I can make sure I have all the ingredients by then,123,25,10:26:39

Erica Yee,Oh yah bread is good hahaha,27,6,10:16:17
Erica Yee,I have eggs,11,3,10:16:04
Ben Fickes,"Sure, that sounds good! Yeah I was about to say veggies too. Actually if youâre good with it, we have so much bread we can maybe eat that instead of potatoes? And for veggies should we just buy something frozen and defrost it?",228,43,10:15:55
Erica Yee,And then some kind of veggies haha,34,7,10:15:07
Ben Fickes,Do you have any of them already? I have half an onion haha,58,13,10:14:59

Ben Fickes,Ooh that looks really good,26,5,10:13:39
Ben Fickes,"Uh idk how to describe the pan my mom used but it wasnât loaf shaped, I think I have one of those. John has two that are loaf of bread shaped so if thatâs what most people use then yes haha. We can use your recipe this time and my moms another?",248,52,10:13:19
Erica Yee,(yes this is a Google doc lol),30,7,10:13:14
Erica Yee,Do you have a loaf pan?,23,6,10:11:46
Ben Fickes,HAHA we can use either one haha,31,7,10:11:34

Erica Yee,My mom has a good recipe (unless you already have one),54,11,10:11:20
Erica Yee,Ooh meatloaf!,13,2,10:11:05
Ben Fickes,"Also, a couple food ideas I had: meatloaf, stew, the egg and tomatoes, or of course something else. I was thinking though, all the ingredients may have to come from Whole Foods, because with the race idk if itâll be very easy to get to tjâs or star market",259,49,10:07:24
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling?,20,4,10:05:27
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, hope you sleep well :)",30,6,0:34:47
Erica Yee,Gnight,6,1,0:32:26
Erica Yee,Think I'm tired enough that it should be ok tho,47,10,0:32:23

Erica Yee,Lol ok cannot think of anything rn and going to bed,51,11,0:29:34
Erica Yee,Hmmm,4,1,0:16:22
Ben Fickes,"Yeah sounds good! What do we cook then, I'll probably swing by the store for stuff (unless you wanna go together)? And maybe we can just make enough to have leftovers if you're okay with eating the same thing twice haha",219,41,0:14:55
Erica Yee,I was just planning on eating before ST (which probably means I'll need a second dinner later lol oh well),106,20,0:14:07
Erica Yee,Cook since we probably have more time?,38,7,0:13:26
Ben Fickes,And no worries if you have other plans or anything for dinner,61,12,0:10:56
Ben Fickes,"Tomorrow if you wanna get dinner, do you have a preference between cooking or eating out?",89,16,0:10:27
Ben Fickes,Okay haha I look forward to it :) and OH I have no idea why donut makes more sense than bagel but it does haha,110,25,0:10:05
Erica Yee,Also I realized I said bagel earlier when I meant to say they visited 8 donut shops ð,88,18,0:09:28
Erica Yee,I can tell you better in person,31,7,0:09:00
Erica Yee,Nothing hugely revelatory,25,3,0:08:49
Ben Fickes,Any particular points that stood out to you?,44,8,23:58:32
Ben Fickes,Oh I'm extremely interested in what you all said about it haha,62,12,23:58:15
Erica Yee,Hearing white girls' perspective lolol,38,5,23:58:05
Erica Yee,Also Vivian dbo Lisa Molly Nathalie and I talked about white/Asian adoption and interracial dating a bit which was interesting haha,131,21,23:57:41
Ben Fickes,"Okay, let's do it for sure then :) I have a few other random, not-quite ideas for stuff to do sometime I can tell you about when I see you next",143,31,23:57:30
Erica Yee,Lisa and Nathalie were talking about how they had a picnic there before and it was really nice,94,18,23:55:42
Erica Yee,And I have not but I've wanted to,33,8,23:55:11
Erica Yee,Yes she did see me lol,22,6,23:55:00
Ben Fickes,Have you been?,14,3,23:53:34
Ben Fickes,"First off, good for Vivian! And did Lisa notice you in the same row? And I don't think I've been (there's a scholars thing on one island but idk which one haha), I'd love to go! :)",180,37,23:53:28
Erica Yee,Have you been?,14,3,23:52:33
Erica Yee,Also also! Can we go to the Boston harbor islands in the summer/fall,68,13,23:52:30
Erica Yee,They went to Walden pond and a battle reenactment in Arlington today lolol,74,13,23:51:01
Erica Yee,Also random but apparently Lisa and her parents were IN THE SAME ROW as me today at church but I somehow did not see them at all,128,27,23:50:24
Erica Yee,"Yeah, you know how Vivian was somewhat disgruntled about ST saying we wanted to be more outward but not really doing tangible things. So she hopes this will be something people can invite their friends to and then they have dinner after together or something",258,45,23:49:47
Erica Yee,Hahaha,6,1,23:48:10
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow! I know it's for the sport but I like ""Dbo's ultimate Bible study"" out of context haha. And nice! I know several people wanted that (and I'm sure it'll help with CEP haha)",178,35,23:46:41
Erica Yee,She's gonna spearhead this thing similar to aletheia's service saturdays,72,10,23:45:47
Erica Yee,And Vivian's joining ST after all (LOL but I'm happy),53,10,23:45:18
Erica Yee,It was good! Dbo's ultimate Bible study starts tomorrow,55,9,23:45:00
Erica Yee,I think their planned route was 13.1 miles but her Fitbit told her 10 afterward or something,92,17,23:44:24
Ben Fickes,How was seeing Vivian and Dbo?,30,6,23:41:33
Ben Fickes,HAHA I have no idea how those numbers relate to 26.2 but I get the spirit and admire her dedication haha,104,21,23:40:58
Erica Yee,They walked 10 miles to hit up 8 bagel shops ð®ð®,53,11,23:40:27
Erica Yee,Claire just told me the reason she woke up so early was her friend and her did an anti-marathon,95,19,23:40:09
Ben Fickes,I can imagine haha hope it's not the same person as before,58,12,23:39:48
Erica Yee,Aw thanks but it's ok,21,5,23:39:30
Erica Yee,My mom is calling them omg someone's gonna get an earful,56,11,23:39:09
Ben Fickes,Oh I remember you mentioning that. I'm sorry. I would offer to get it for you but I'm guessing there's probably some form of verifying who you are haha,151,29,23:37:53
Erica Yee,Ugh I have to go into CVS tomorrow AGAIN because the bottle says I should have 20 but they only gave me 10,106,23,23:37:12
Ben Fickes,Thank you haha I think I also just didn't comb my hair freshman year,68,14,23:36:00
Erica Yee,I do like your and Jason's haircuts better now,46,9,23:35:29
Ben Fickes,"He said ""you all look better in these now than you did two years ago"" haha",74,16,23:32:43
Ben Fickes,I showed these all to Thiago though and he appreciated them,59,11,23:32:22
Ben Fickes,I know that's the one that gets me the most...,46,10,23:31:59
Erica Yee,Your Bible study ð­,21,4,23:31:44
Erica Yee,ð¢ð¢,8,1,23:31:31
Ben Fickes,This is really sad to say but some of these pics make me super sad just because of the people in them who arenât friends anymore,130,26,23:07:47
Ben Fickes,Okay here are all the pics I found from my freshman year haha,61,13,23:07:17
Ben Fickes,Oh nice. How was it?,20,5,23:06:43
Erica Yee,Walking back now finally haha,29,5,23:05:47
Erica Yee,Oh ok maybe I'll find another use for them,42,9,23:05:27
Ben Fickes,Haha that is funny for no apparent reason,41,8,23:05:02
Ben Fickes,Ugh it failed to send the pics. And theyâre both doing 5 years I think,72,15,23:04:42
Erica Yee,Lol why is this so funny,24,6,23:04:13
Erica Yee,Is Dan or Jason graduating?,27,5,23:03:35
Ben Fickes,Haha I guess Iâll see them in a year. I have a few I found,60,15,23:02:32
Erica Yee,Wow sorry don't want to think about that now actually lol,57,11,23:01:53
Erica Yee,Looking through my photos I have so many for our year hehe,58,12,23:01:36
Erica Yee,sounds good,11,2,22:10:40
Ben Fickes,Yeah thatâs what Iâm kinda thinking. Maybe I can reach out again in a few weeks since he mentioned the summer,113,21,22:05:55
Erica Yee,maybe hold off for now? but i appreciate your trying,52,10,22:05:26
Erica Yee,and he didn't really answer so idk,34,7,22:04:53
Erica Yee,and i was like uhh do you want to hang with him,47,12,22:04:48
Erica Yee,yeah yesterday he told me that,30,6,22:04:43
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I appreciate it, thank you! Idk whether I should reach out to him or let him reach out since he hasnât replied to my last few messages",141,28,21:52:45
Erica Yee,just wanted to update you,25,5,21:39:28
Erica Yee,yeah :/,7,2,21:39:24
Ben Fickes,Dang. Hope heâs okay. Wish he would talk about it because I donât know exactly whatâs going on,100,18,21:33:22

Erica Yee,Lol thanks,10,2,21:03:57
Ben Fickes,You can always take them out and use echolocation,49,9,20:44:29
Erica Yee,It's mainly my eyes are really tired and I want to take out my contacts but don't have my glasses,97,20,20:40:45
Ben Fickes,"I donât think they mind you staying if you wanna stay. If you wanna hang out at all later youâre welcome here, but if youâre feeling so tired youâd rather just go home thatâs all good too!",198,37,20:39:31
Erica Yee,Lol I should leave and let them have their apartment to themselves (Vivian and dbo are also still here) but I'm so tired don't want to move,139,27,20:38:16
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,20:37:54

Ben Fickes,Either is fine with me. Is it you and me or you me and victor?,62,15,18:45:02
Erica Yee,Or if you want to cook or something,35,8,18:44:27

Erica Yee,ð,4,1,13:43:06
Ben Fickes,I said not really haha. And yep I guess since youâre from California you fantasize about small states haha,108,19,13:34:24
Erica Yee,To one of those small states,28,6,13:21:56
Erica Yee,And LOL I ran off with another guy,34,8,13:19:11
Erica Yee,Aww what did you say?,21,5,13:18:56
Ben Fickes,"I saw Katie and she confused Rhode Island and Delaware so she said, âwait, youâre here, but Ericaâs in Rhode Island?â",125,21,13:10:50
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, hope itâs good! And I asked her and this was her reply:
It was good. Were the deep conversations about their parents hard to watch?
So idk what she actually thought haha. And gotcha",191,35,13:10:17
Erica Yee,"Also Claire's family is visiting apparently, hope they don't stay too late",74,12,12:08:21
Erica Yee,Omg what did she think,22,5,12:08:05
Erica Yee,Lol I've been here twice before and think I saw everything already. Game is at 1 something and not raining thankfully. Overcast so hope I don't get sunburned :P,160,29,12:08:01

Ben Fickes,And is it raining there?,24,5,11:47:39
Ben Fickes,Haha ð sorry Providence is not as exciting as youâd hoped haha. When does the game start?,94,17,11:47:32
Erica Yee,We are walking an hour and a half from Providence to Pawtucket because there's nothing else to do here ð,107,20,11:46:23
Erica Yee,Nice haha*,10,2,11:45:24
Erica Yee,Aww nicehH,10,2,11:45:20
Ben Fickes,Am just finishing volunteering - it was tech help at moreville house. This one woman was in IT and this other woman was SO happy to find out how to do street view,162,33,11:36:02
Ben Fickes,Oh no thatâs sad. But glad youâre a little less sick. Hope your ribs feel better too,88,17,11:34:54
Erica Yee,My mom just texted me that taking calcium (which I take every day) decreases absorption of the antibiotics lol rip,114,20,11:22:29
Erica Yee,Brought my Kindle for the train ride even though I probably should've brought my laptop lol oh well,99,18,10:09:49
Erica Yee,About 40 mins? But it was fine I just read articles,51,11,10:09:17
Erica Yee,"Sick-wise, better. Only a little dry coughing so far this morning. Rib still really hurts",89,15,10:08:46
Ben Fickes,"How are you feeling today? And sorry about the train schedule, how long do you have to wait?",92,18,9:46:53

Erica Yee,"Yep, gnight",11,2,22:50:23
Ben Fickes,Oh wow haha. Well you definitely should be able to get some sleep then! Glad you got back safe,94,19,22:39:33
Erica Yee,Train leaves ruggles at 9:44 and arrives around 11:30 at the MA border then I guess we walk across to RI?? lol I don't understand small states,142,27,22:36:53
Erica Yee,We're back!,11,2,22:35:41
Ben Fickes,"Oh Iâm glad for the last one. On the first, in that case please let me know when you get back haha. And thatâs good, Iâm sure rest will help. What time are you going to RI?",178,37,22:29:55
Erica Yee,Mostly just tired but should be able to get around 9 hours of sleep,67,14,22:29:20
Erica Yee,Ibuprofen kicked in so pain is a lot better,43,9,22:28:56
Erica Yee,Ugh wanted to take the orange line but Sophie probably couldn't walk in her heels lol,85,16,22:28:42
Erica Yee,Currently low-key fearing for my life with how fast this Lyft driver is going,77,14,22:28:21
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling after everything?,37,6,22:23:52
Erica Yee,Yeah it's too complicated for me to understand lol,50,9,22:21:50
Ben Fickes,Wow did not know they had families within the frat but glad they won something haha,83,16,22:20:34

Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. I do not recognize it but I remember the helicopter shot! Haha,73,14,22:18:26
Erica Yee,"Idk what it's called but lyrics I recognize are ""I want you to want me / I need you to need me"" I think it might be the song with the helicopter shot at the end",160,36,22:17:41
Ben Fickes,Haha which one? Not that Iâll recognize it probably. And would still love to hear about it as long as it was not so bad you donât want to talk about it haha,160,33,22:16:27
Erica Yee,Our lyft radio is playing one of the songs from 10 things haha,62,13,22:15:50

Erica Yee,Hope you can relax too,22,5,21:36:10
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,21:36:05

Ben Fickes,"No worries, just trying to follow your instruction of ""make sure I'm taking care of myself"" haha",96,17,15:14:01
Erica Yee,Thanks for the reminder haha,28,5,15:11:43
Erica Yee,"Actually I guess it's been four hours, so I can snack and take some more ibuprofen",82,16,15:11:36

Erica Yee,Ohh gotcha,10,2,13:40:09
Ben Fickes,And my group's good with that,29,6,13:39:11
Ben Fickes,But I think we're gonna get a bad grade honestly if we just do that so there's some extra stuff I want to do,108,24,13:38:59
Ben Fickes,"So we shot very low on this so in theory we are almost done our mvp, my partners have not done that much yet though",115,25,13:38:39
Erica Yee,how much more do you have to do,31,8,13:19:50
Erica Yee,oh yay!,7,2,13:19:47
Ben Fickes,Sorta fixed the bug? It works now but itâs not loading from memory as efficiently. Idk if itâs a bug with what I wrote or what someone else wrote,149,29,13:15:50
Ben Fickes,Thanks me too haha,18,4,12:26:23
Erica Yee,hope you figure it out x),25,6,12:04:59
Erica Yee,ummm lol,8,2,12:04:56
Ben Fickes,Throwback to NYC when we communicated mostly about articles haha,64,10,11:56:27
Ben Fickes,"Ooh that does look interesting, Iâll check it out when I fix a bug in my project (just to rant, Iâm getting a segfault in a getter!?!?)",139,27,11:56:12
Erica Yee,sorta interesting if you have time,34,6,11:21:32
Erica Yee,https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-boston-marathon-messes-with-runners-to-slow-them-down/,90,1,11:21:30
Erica Yee,i will,6,2,10:49:06

Erica Yee,yeah resting until the formal ð¬,34,6,10:40:05
Erica Yee,no idea yet haha,16,4,10:39:55
Erica Yee,she she said she'll give me an override to register for 5 classes and then i can drop one when necessary,104,21,10:39:34
Ben Fickes,Oh I still owe you my schedule,30,7,10:39:30
Ben Fickes,I have no idea what anyone can do about it but do you need anyone to check this out? Also maybe resting for the day might be helpful. And oh dang sorry to hear that. What are you gonna take in place of it?,205,44,10:39:22
Erica Yee,bc they didn't expect enrollment to be as high as it is so far and it's a required class for some grad students that may enroll in the summer,141,29,10:39:03
Erica Yee,oh also the journalism advisor emailed me saying they might have to kick me out of the grad class LOL,101,20,10:38:39
Erica Yee,i can kind of not lift my right arm without stabbing pain yikes,63,13,10:38:17
Erica Yee,oh dang ok,10,3,10:37:47
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha itâs not that bad, I feel perfectly fine besides my throat. Hopefully I get better really quickly. Idk if I got it from you or Thiago though because he said yesterday he has a sore throat",205,39,10:37:28
Erica Yee,i'm so sorry,12,3,10:36:15
Erica Yee,omg nooooo,10,2,10:36:13
Ben Fickes,My throat has been a little sore since Wednesday night but has held pretty constant today and yesterday so hopefully I can beat whatever I have before it gets bad,162,30,10:35:24
Ben Fickes,"Geez, Iâm so sorry Erica. Hope you get well soon. And yeah wasnât it like 80 or something?",94,18,10:34:46
Erica Yee,i told you the average right?,29,6,10:34:03
Erica Yee,uhh i think we're measuring pickups. thanks,43,7,10:33:59
Erica Yee,"not that i know what it feels like, but i feel like i've been shot lol",70,16,10:33:46
Erica Yee,i was feeling alright -- same but alright -- and then i just did something (coughed too hard?) and now my rib is much worse,123,25,10:33:31
Ben Fickes,Idk which youâre measuring,28,4,10:33:07
Ben Fickes,91!? Wow I was way off haha. But is that unlocks or pickups? Because it lists âfirst app used after unlockingâ and those add up to 53 only,142,28,10:32:57
Ben Fickes,Iâll check. How are you feeling today?,40,7,10:29:49
Erica Yee,Did screen time keep track of your total pickups for yesterday haha,67,12,7:28:53
Erica Yee,Gotcha,6,1,22:18:51
Ben Fickes,So Michael didnât actually tell me haha but from tone and previous conversation I think they are not going out but are still friends,134,24,22:13:03
Erica Yee,Like they're gonna go out or they're still friends,50,9,22:09:41
Erica Yee,Wait what does cool mean,24,5,22:09:31
Erica Yee,Yeah I'll tell you in person,28,6,22:08:51
Ben Fickes,And he talked to âthe personâ tonight (he hasnât told me who still but I think I know). He said theyâre cool which is the best result he could hope for,159,31,22:08:24
Ben Fickes,"Michael is doing logistics, not menâs group next year",55,9,22:07:38
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Hope this does not fall under gossip but I am intrigued haha,69,14,22:07:20
Erica Yee,I took notes for future reference lol,37,7,22:01:48
Erica Yee,Omg Sophie just told me about her frat little's love life and it literally is like a rom com plot (at least the beginning),122,24,22:01:35
Erica Yee,Yay that's great!,17,3,22:00:21
Ben Fickes,Nice haha. Hmm itâs building off of last week. So I think the more we did last week (a lot) the easier this will be. Weâre calling it a night now already and an hour and a half in weâre at 17/27 tests (roughly). So Iâm feeling good!,240,48,21:56:50
Erica Yee,Is the assignment as hard as last week?,39,8,21:27:24
Erica Yee,I told my roommates about it and ran into them walking into the building haha,77,15,21:27:08
Erica Yee,"It was good, from otto",22,5,21:26:54
Ben Fickes,Still working with Michael but in short I feel like we are more even in skill level on this assignment haha,107,21,21:17:39
Ben Fickes,Big question is how good was it? And did you go with roommates? Glad there were people haha,91,18,21:16:00
Erica Yee,Yay good turnout?,17,3,20:14:40
Erica Yee,And we got here at 8:05 rip lol,31,8,20:14:34
Erica Yee,Got the second to last piece of pizza felt so bad for people behind me,70,15,20:14:28
Ben Fickes,Hope you can get some food haha,31,7,19:48:08
Erica Yee,Yeah that was my thinking too,29,6,19:48:04
Erica Yee,LOL whoops,10,2,19:47:57
Ben Fickes,Iâm sorry about the nausea. But hopefully that means itâs powerful enough to work,85,14,19:47:55
Ben Fickes,Yeah your dad strikes me as pretty chill haha,45,9,19:47:30
Erica Yee,Gonna briefly drop by nu sci 10 year celebration soon,53,10,19:45:13
Erica Yee,"Felt nauseous after taking the new med for a bit though. Maybe cuz I took it right before I ate, should've taken a few bites first",130,26,19:44:59
Erica Yee,My dad was chill. Got a decent amount of work done.,51,11,19:44:15
Erica Yee,Aww nice,8,2,19:44:00
Ben Fickes,It was pretty good. I did a cartwheel today and got laughed at by the children. And I taught some kids how to make paper airplanes haha. How was your day?,154,31,19:27:03
Erica Yee,How was volunteering,20,3,19:25:18
Erica Yee,Oh yikes haha,13,3,19:25:14
Ben Fickes,I went to michaels apartment to work with him on systems and apparently heâs not home haha,92,17,19:23:41
Erica Yee,Yup,3,1,11:48:50
Ben Fickes,Aw dang. At least you only have one class today,47,10,11:45:26
Erica Yee,Good thing I have a tissue stock that will hopefully last haha,62,12,11:44:40
Erica Yee,Ofc all my mucus decides it wants to come out when I have class sigh,68,15,11:44:24
Ben Fickes,"Would love to hear about it, thanks :)",38,8,11:41:21
Erica Yee,"Listened to interesting podcast about reporting on American church scandals, remind me to tell you about it sometime",116,18,11:41:00
Ben Fickes,Oh nice haha. Glad your thermometer is doing its job haha,57,11,11:33:46
Erica Yee,She also said she thought she had a fever cuz it was 99 and Sophie just lectured her haha,89,19,11:33:21
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð well Iâm glad sheâs improving then haha,53,9,11:32:27
Erica Yee,B just said this is her best semester ever sleep-wise and I'm shook lol,71,14,11:32:07
Ben Fickes,I will :),9,3,11:30:49
Erica Yee,Oh danggg,9,2,11:30:35
Erica Yee,Aww tell your mom thanks please,31,6,11:30:26
Ben Fickes,Also my mom told me on the phone when we were talking about you being sick she had hepatitis for half a semester in college and had to drop a class because of it!?!?,165,34,11:20:33
Ben Fickes,Ignore bagel stuff haha,23,4,11:19:57
Ben Fickes,"âWill help acne too!â Haha thatâs hilarious. Hope it does help and you donât get sunburned! That reminds me, my mom texted me to ask about you yesterday",160,28,11:19:44
Erica Yee,omg it's so sunny today,23,5,11:18:43
Erica Yee,these are such specific instructions lol,40,6,11:18:26
Erica Yee,"""called in doxycycline, they have in stock, ready in hour (ha) - should be ready after your class. one every 12 hours with food and don't get too much sun (or use sunscreen bec you can get sunburned). don't lie down for at least 1/2 hour after taking. will help acne too!""",272,52,11:18:22
Erica Yee,lol i think you will find my mom's message funny,48,10,11:17:20
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,10:46:57
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hope it helps,21,4,10:46:26
Erica Yee,In place I think,16,4,10:41:23
Ben Fickes,In place of amoxicillin or in addition to?,42,8,10:40:12
Erica Yee,She's calling in different meds now sigh,40,7,10:39:57
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,10:39:44
Ben Fickes,"I also think I can't imagine your mom saying ""you have a bruised rib lol""",73,15,10:38:52
Erica Yee,Wow you know me so well,23,6,10:35:28
Ben Fickes,I'm assuming the lol is yours not hers haha,43,9,10:34:02
Erica Yee,"My mom's text diagnosis says probably not pneumonia, just bruised rib lol",73,12,10:33:40
Erica Yee,Oh yeah ofc I've showed + made fun of them to several people,60,13,10:33:11
Ben Fickes,"Yep! To use a needlessly big word to describe it, it's a portmanteau haha. And *sigh* I guess it's fine to not have them, but I was *really* hoping for them ððð jk don't tell Pat but those shirt don't look good to me and also seem extra",245,48,10:31:15
Erica Yee,3. Hard no to embroidered shirts,32,6,10:29:00
Erica Yee,Oh it's relieves but alleviate!,31,5,10:27:40
Ben Fickes,And thatâs interesting about the church thing. I have seen many people (particularly guys but maybe just because I know guys) be very influenced by their SOs in terms of beliefs. But donât think Iâve known anyone at my church whose been married or even in a long term relationship during my time there and still attends,325,57,10:27:11
Ben Fickes,HAHA itâs alleviates I think (I forgot an l and relied on autocorrect so clearly I donât know how to spell it either),121,23,10:25:31
Erica Yee,Yeah ikr?? She's hanging with him tomorrow so she said she'll double check that he's doing sound for us which alieves (how do you spell that word??) Some of my stress,166,31,10:24:42
Erica Yee,Mostly spiritually. There's some people at church at home whose non Christian partners would come to church with when they were dating but stopped when they married,164,27,10:23:20
Ben Fickes,âIâm sure sheâs a fine girl... for someone elseâ dang Erin is pulling no punches,88,15,10:22:45
Erica Yee,Yikes ð¬,10,2,10:21:41
Erica Yee,"Me: Pat *says* he'll do sound for us but I'm not sure if he'll actually show up
Chichi: speaking of Pat, have your met his gf?
Erin: ..mhm
Chichi: oh?
Me: uh she's nice
Erin: she's not a Christian
Chichi: wow girl ok honest haha
Erin: yeah I ask personal questions. I'm sure she's a fine girl.. for someone else",311,60,10:21:34
Ben Fickes,"Oh going back to the dating convo, Joshua Kwokâs high school (and first year of college) gf was non Christian. Didnât know him super well then but he talked some about it in FCG and had some interesting thoughts on the matter",229,42,10:09:31
Ben Fickes,Is this a subtle hint you want us to get embroidered t shirts ððð,74,14,10:07:23
Ben Fickes,WHAT haha thatâs hilarious ð,33,5,10:07:04
Ben Fickes,"Okay I donât have much to say, but my first question is how did you find out she isnât Christian? And I second that about not understanding how you could be with someone who doesnât share your faith. And when you say âpulled awayâ do you mean spiritually or âI never see so-and-so anymore?â And Iâm glad we can be an upstanding example of a Christian couple haha",378,68,10:06:37
Erica Yee,(that's all my thoughts for now btw),36,7,10:06:04
Erica Yee,?!?!?!???!,10,1,10:05:51
Ben Fickes,No you did not haha,19,5,10:04:16
Erica Yee,Omg (semi-related) did I show you Patrick's embroidered shirts,62,9,10:04:04
Erica Yee,Which I hadn't heard before,27,5,10:03:43
Erica Yee,That was basically it. We talked about her personal life more too (guys that have asked her out and her parents' expectations),126,22,10:03:23
Erica Yee,She also said you and I are the first Christian-Christian couple she's seen whom she's friends with haha,104,18,10:02:45
Erica Yee,We basically ranted about how we can't understand how you could be with someone who doesn't share such an important part of your life and complained about our friends getting pulled away,186,32,10:01:47
Ben Fickes,Hope you feel better and have a chill day to help you recover! I will save my questions on this convo now for the end haha,122,26,10:01:22
Erica Yee,"Anyway, last night Sophie and I talked about dating non Christians cuz we found out Patrick hanbury's gf isn't",110,19,10:00:27
Erica Yee,When I breathe it's ok but when I cough it really hurts. I will take Ibuprofen once I eat something,99,20,9:59:12
Erica Yee,It's less so far but haven't really talked yet,46,9,9:58:43
Erica Yee,Holding my breath ð¬,22,4,9:58:32
Ben Fickes,Is your coughing less so far today?,35,7,9:58:25
Ben Fickes,Are you gonna be okay? Idk what an alternative is since you have to breathe but how bad is it?,94,20,9:58:12
Erica Yee,I was coughing still last night and now my rib (or whatever it is) hurts even when I breathe lol so will ask my mom if that's normal,132,28,9:52:27
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well thatâs good! Glad right now at least youâre feeling a little better,84,14,9:51:33
Ben Fickes,Holy cow I have no idea how she can survive like this,53,12,9:51:01
Erica Yee,But I'm feeling alright so far. Preliminary status is my congestion seems good right now however it usually takes some time to get stuffy after I wake up all we'll see,167,31,9:51:00
Erica Yee,Claire just came home and has to shower before her 1030 so now I'm drying my hair in my bedroom ð,100,21,9:49:52
Ben Fickes,Haha thanks! And wow thatâs a fast shower but okay,52,10,9:30:07
Erica Yee,One sec while I shower,22,5,9:29:29
Erica Yee,No worries you don't have to tell me when you sleep haha,56,12,9:29:25
Ben Fickes,"I am so sorry, I went to sleep and forgot to tell you I was. But glad you had a good deep conversation! Any highlights or particularly deep points from it? And, of course, how are you feeling today?",198,39,9:23:18
Erica Yee,Had a good deep talk with Sophie about dating though,52,10,23:49:45
Erica Yee,Oh yeah ok,10,3,23:48:48
Erica Yee,She just kept pressuring them and trying to keep the conversation going. Yeah I've heard they target POC,104,18,23:48:04
Ben Fickes,"Unrelated but I forgot to talk to you about visiting in the summer, Iâll try to remember next time",100,19,23:32:42
Ben Fickes,Oh yikes indeed. What happened? Theyâve never approached me (though Iâve heard they have a target demographic thatâs not me),130,20,23:24:40
Erica Yee,Heard Sophie's cult story in full... It was one of her pharmacy classmates yikes,80,14,23:21:55
Erica Yee,Same,4,1,22:29:14
Ben Fickes,Omw,3,1,22:29:05
Erica Yee,Oh just got here lol,20,5,22:28:38
Ben Fickes,And again I can drop it off too!,32,8,22:18:53
Ben Fickes,Okay haha sounds good,21,4,22:18:31
Erica Yee,I'll let you know when I get there,34,8,22:18:26
Erica Yee,It's ok I don't mind,20,5,22:18:16
Ben Fickes,"Really? Thatâs good! And if youâd like sure, but if you wanna sleep no worries I can get it to you another time",115,23,22:16:21
Erica Yee,Do you want me to drop by?,26,7,22:15:43
Erica Yee,And I'm feeling somewhat better,31,5,22:15:36
Ben Fickes,Well thatâs really good haha,30,5,22:15:31
Erica Yee,It was really good. We are getting more prepared than any time in recent memory lol,83,16,22:15:13
Ben Fickes,How was it? And how are you now?,32,8,22:12:43
Erica Yee,I took ibuprofen but thanks haha,32,6,22:12:22
Erica Yee,We just finished,16,3,22:11:16
Ben Fickes,"Iâm home, but no worries either way! I can also bring it to you if youâd prefer less time in the cold. And Iâm so sorry Erica. Do you want any ibuprofen or anything? I really hope you start feeling better soon",215,42,20:52:02
Erica Yee,I'm coughing so hard today my ribs hurt ð,44,9,20:34:36
Erica Yee,Or actually I should be able to drop by your place afterward if you're home,75,15,20:33:54
Erica Yee,Just left enc to go to worship team rehearsal so probably not tonight?,70,13,20:33:19
Ben Fickes,Do you want your present tonight or tomorrow/another day?,57,9,20:30:04

Ben Fickes,Wow all of that is a lot but glad youâre talking to Sophie and glad you got the software installed haha,105,21,18:39:08
Erica Yee,After we finally got it to work I said PRAISE THE LORD and the help desk person started laughing so hard,104,21,18:38:10
Erica Yee,Also unrelated but I spent half an hour with Abby And then after her shift ended her colleague trying to install the printer software on my computer,148,27,18:37:37
Erica Yee,"I'm just like, no you're not crazy for thinking what they're saying is crazy. Don't believe them even if a lot sounds similar to us",131,25,18:36:57
Erica Yee,Sophie got approached by the God the mother quote and she's asking me all these questions,89,16,18:36:29
Erica Yee,Haha true,9,2,18:36:07
Ben Fickes,"HAHA thatâs amazing, I was expecting it to be him and his siblings. Your sister stole your favorite color though",114,20,18:27:05
Erica Yee,Apparently,10,1,18:14:31
Ben Fickes,Yes please! Is that today,25,5,18:13:21
Erica Yee,Do you want to see a pic my dad sent for siblings day or whatever,65,15,17:57:01
Erica Yee,ð®ð® ok!,12,2,17:56:48
Ben Fickes,"And I just got off the phone with my mom - I *might* be able to visit once during the summer before August, Iâll talk to you about it sometime",144,30,17:46:08
Ben Fickes,I have a funny story from going to west h Iâll tell you in person,67,15,17:45:22
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. Hope he doesnât pull that on your group. But glad you got the approval! I will definitely participate haha,124,22,17:45:01
Erica Yee,The bad group member is actually sorta helpful when he's present. BUT he's also in my bostonography class. He asked how presentations were on Monday. I asked if he's presenting by himself tomorrow. He said he's supposed to but doesn't have anything ready so just not going to show up in class ð²,297,53,17:21:18
Erica Yee,I will ask you to participate in person haha,44,9,17:19:31
Erica Yee,Professor approved my phone study idea yay,42,7,17:19:11
Ben Fickes,Prof said there is Khoury stuff at west h so Iâm gonna check there haha,73,15,16:29:51
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey hope it goes well!,28,5,16:22:37
Erica Yee,Ok my team is gonna work together so I'll see you later,55,12,16:22:19
Ben Fickes,Thatâs rare right? Okay haha just lemme know,46,8,16:07:21
Erica Yee,ok. both of my other 2 team members are here so maybe we'll meet,64,14,15:51:13
Ben Fickes,"Yeah probably unless youâre leaving early, cuz my team is working too. And wow hope you can get through class okay haha",121,22,15:45:48
Erica Yee,i'm getting sleepy and classmate in front of me whose computer multitasking usually entertains me is looking at scandalous cosplay lol..,136,21,15:40:36
Erica Yee,oh are you staying the whole class period tho?,46,9,15:39:06
Ben Fickes,Class is a work day so I can technically leave a few minutes early if you want so I can meet you right at 4:30,110,25,15:33:37
Ben Fickes,Okay lemme know if you do,25,6,15:33:08
Erica Yee,if my group isn't meeting i might,33,7,15:06:43
Ben Fickes,Are you gonna go,16,4,14:54:44
Erica Yee,apparently the khoury naming ceremony goes till 5 and there's food,66,11,14:52:31
Ben Fickes,Yeah for sure,13,3,11:23:15
Erica Yee,"Yeah sure, does 2:35 give you enough time to walk to class?",59,12,11:17:49
Ben Fickes,Oh speaking of class do you want to walk over together today?,61,12,11:14:02
Ben Fickes,I guess simpler is good with limited time haha,46,9,11:13:47
Erica Yee,Cuz he said do a simpler one and this is much simpler lol,57,13,9:15:28
Erica Yee,It sounds kinda lame but I will ask my professor at class,57,12,9:15:20
Erica Yee,And then we use screentime on iOS (or digital wellbeing on Android) and compare how many unlocks they actually had,114,20,9:14:50
Erica Yee,"The ""treatment"" group would be first told the average number, then asked how they compare",89,15,9:14:13
Ben Fickes,Ooh thatâs a really good idea,31,6,9:13:37
Ben Fickes,Something with the phone chargers they have?,44,7,9:13:32
Erica Yee,My current idea is go around asking people how many times they think they unlock their phone a day,98,19,9:13:26
Ben Fickes,Do plates count as technology haha,34,6,9:13:07
Erica Yee,No I appreciate! That is a good idea but we have to do something with technology,80,16,9:12:54
Ben Fickes,Oh random thought but could your experiment involve the dining halls and how much food people take/throwaway? Sorry I know you know how to design an experiment better than I do but figured it was worth it to throw out an idea,225,42,9:12:15
Ben Fickes,What do you have against psych ð haha jk I will and hope your group plans something today haha,97,19,9:10:49
Erica Yee,But jk lemme know how it goes,29,7,9:07:30
Erica Yee,Don't say that word ð,24,5,9:07:00
Ben Fickes,"Speaking of hours, Iâm about to go to my last psych experiment",64,12,8:51:13
Erica Yee,Yeah I need them hours haha,27,6,8:37:03
Ben Fickes,Wait you have volunteering my b about the sleep thing,53,10,8:21:16
Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâm so sorry. Are you able to go back to sleep? And I take it youâre not feeling great health wise then after not sleeping well?,138,28,8:18:57
Erica Yee,And coughed so much while I was in bed (seemed like we were trading coughs lol),79,16,8:16:06
Erica Yee,Claire was home when I went to bed for the first time in a few days so that's probably a reason why I took some time to get to sleep,132,30,8:15:18
Erica Yee,Did not sleep well last night ugh,33,7,8:14:05
Ben Fickes,"Whenever you wake up, how are you doing haha",44,9,7:53:27
Ben Fickes,"Goodnight, hope you sleep well!",31,5,23:58:50
Erica Yee,"Thanks, good night!",19,3,23:42:07
Ben Fickes,I hope they do,14,4,23:34:12
Erica Yee,nope. maybe my group members will think of something,52,9,23:30:59
Ben Fickes,Do you have any other ideas rn?,31,7,23:29:04
Ben Fickes,What Iâm so sorry. Is there anything you could do at the formal or ball game as a way to multitask haha,105,22,23:28:48
Erica Yee,have to think of a new experiment and conduct it in a week omg,62,14,23:27:46
Erica Yee,because my research professor finally replied to our proposal and rejected it lmao,82,13,23:27:32
Erica Yee,yes at least i have this happiness,34,7,23:27:15
Ben Fickes,That is amazing! Glad you can get some stuff out of this class even if most of it was easy for you,98,22,23:25:52
Erica Yee,i feel like i'm actually learning how to code right now which is amazing,72,14,23:24:31
Ben Fickes,Oh wait I said nice thatâs right my b haha,44,10,23:22:20
Ben Fickes,Nice! And I replied with a joke but not a serious way to go haha,64,15,23:22:12
Erica Yee,and yup i disabled all zooming so no issue,42,9,23:21:44
Erica Yee,wait you did reply on snap haha,31,7,23:21:35
Erica Yee,my professor gave high level advice and it was exactly what i needed,68,13,23:21:25
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah sorry I didnât reply but that did look good! Minus the water but thatâs not a huge issue haha,105,21,23:21:21
Erica Yee,very happy with myself at figuring out the map!!!!!!,52,9,23:20:53
Ben Fickes,How are you doing now?,22,5,23:13:35
Ben Fickes,Yep haha,8,2,23:13:30
Erica Yee,oh i realize you don't have group projects in other classes haha,64,12,23:09:18
Erica Yee,game engine group?,18,3,23:07:52
Erica Yee,aw i'm glad you could relax,27,6,23:07:50
Ben Fickes,My group did not respond so used the excuse to game with DP people for an hour haha. Was a much needed break,108,23,22:58:17
Erica Yee,heh i appreciate,16,3,21:36:52
Ben Fickes,Itâs important to affirm the little things,44,7,21:35:06
Erica Yee,thanks ð,11,2,21:29:28
Ben Fickes,Haha that reminds me of one time when Danny and I were coming up with CS related pickup lines. And Iâm so proud of you Erica,126,26,21:27:28
Erica Yee,just peed whoo,14,3,21:26:17
Erica Yee,"also slightly funny story from class: my group members are using github for the first time, and when i would go like ""can you commit please"", jasmine wu replied ""i just don't think i'm readiy for anything long-term. do you even have a ring for me?"" ð",253,47,21:23:24
Erica Yee,ohh fun haha,12,3,21:21:56
Ben Fickes,Itâs a GameCube game where you have a ball (with a monkey in it haha) and you tilt the stage to roll it through a goal. Jason just downloaded it on an emulator but canât figure out how to set up the controllers with it,222,45,21:20:39
Erica Yee,nope,4,1,21:19:15
Erica Yee,LOL jason,9,2,21:19:14
Ben Fickes,Do you know the game super monkey ball,38,8,21:18:52
Ben Fickes,"Yeah they did, thanks for asking her though",43,8,21:18:39
Ben Fickes,So this time I got fries with it haha. And this is the second time I have ever eaten at Popeyes,95,21,21:18:29
Ben Fickes,Jason said âI had to let you discover that their so called healthy options are terrible for yourselfâ,105,18,21:18:10
Erica Yee,"Also they probably announced it at IV but Christine said the event with the Jewish student Union is at 8:15, so after ST",120,23,21:17:56
Ben Fickes,I have only been twice. Both times got 5 tenders. First time got side of rice and beans and it was pretty bad,109,23,21:17:45
Ben Fickes,"Iâm so sorry, would say you could come over but Iâm at DP",61,13,21:17:20
Erica Yee,What do you get at Popeyes,26,6,21:17:20
Erica Yee,No I haven't,12,3,21:17:02
Ben Fickes,I went to Popeyes with Jason for dinner,39,8,21:16:43
Ben Fickes,Sorry Iâll take your mind off of it if you havenât haha,59,12,21:16:10
Ben Fickes,Wait so have you gotten to pee yet,34,8,21:15:59
Erica Yee,Hopefully haha,14,2,21:15:44
Erica Yee,Think it will survive though,28,5,21:15:41
Erica Yee,Got home and she had just gotten into the shower!! My bladder omg,65,13,21:15:30
Erica Yee,Omg I rushed home to get Barbara a thermometer (lol probably 10th CVS trip in the past week) and didn't go to the bathroom after class,134,26,21:15:11
Erica Yee,That we both don't really know,30,6,21:14:37
Erica Yee,Yeah and Jasmine wu and I are muddling through JavaScript,57,10,21:14:27
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well thatâs good that at least if things go terribly wrong you have an option. But Iâm sure youâll be able to figure it out (this group does work right?),170,32,21:13:27
Erica Yee,"But now that we've done some work on the changing the transportation map, I'm like might as well see if we can get it to work",125,26,21:12:32
Erica Yee,At the end of class we realized we're gonna have a scrollytelling aspect at the end with images so we technically fulfill the requirement,137,24,21:11:58
Erica Yee,"Because the whole point of the final project is to make a scrollytelling page, and we kinda forgot about that till now",118,22,21:11:13
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Sounds like quite the class. Why do you have  to change the project now?,81,16,21:08:28
Erica Yee,Aww yay Angela,14,3,21:07:25
Erica Yee,Also two of us literally took almost 2 hours to figure out how to change the color/style of the map. Tried so many ways and it turned out we were just using an out of date version of this JavaScript library ðð,215,42,21:07:15
Erica Yee,But hopefully we can figure it out cuz project + long self-evaluation and design critique due at the end of next class,118,22,21:06:20
Erica Yee,Our project was going fine but then we need to do something a lot harder (basically my getting rid of my drop down menu on the map to make the paths automatically animate when you scroll) and now I'm feeling anxious about it because everything's breaking lol,258,47,21:05:49
Ben Fickes,Also Angelaâs talk was very good. Very honest about faith and doubt,69,12,20:28:33
Ben Fickes,How was class?,14,3,20:27:42
Ben Fickes,"We did, and people filled the piazza thread with memes (mostly shrek)",69,12,20:27:36
Erica Yee,and lol sorry josh,18,4,20:27:03
Erica Yee,so you guys did get an extension?,33,7,20:26:56
Erica Yee,omg nice!!,10,2,20:26:50
Ben Fickes,Josh Eng pre makes name tags now and I saw he has one for both you and John haha,80,19,18:02:56
Ben Fickes,I fixed my bugs in systems! Hope you have a good class,54,12,17:54:56
Ben Fickes,Hopefully she feels better soon,31,5,16:45:12
Erica Yee,Not that bad but she's resting a lot,36,8,16:42:44
Ben Fickes,"Oh no, how bad is it? Hopefully since you sleep in different rooms, that helps it not spread",92,18,16:38:27
Erica Yee,Apparently b is feeling sick but it's very weird and different symptoms,71,12,16:36:38
Erica Yee,It's ok just went a one sentence email,38,8,16:36:17
Ben Fickes,Okay I can ask too if you don't feel like it,44,11,16:34:38
Erica Yee,I'll ask,8,2,16:27:37
Erica Yee,Omg yeah that was supposed to be that day right?,48,10,16:27:35
Ben Fickes,Wait what about the Passover/Easter thing? Is that not happening now?,69,11,16:24:09
Erica Yee,Literally every Monday holiday has ST haha,42,7,16:22:55
Erica Yee,Also hi Michael,15,3,16:22:14
Erica Yee,I thought we didn't have any more meetings this year but guess so,65,13,16:21:58
Erica Yee,Lol Christine's email..,23,3,16:21:30
Erica Yee,yup,3,1,13:32:31
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hopefully tomorrow you feel at least a little better,60,10,13:32:18
Erica Yee,Not yet that I can tell ð¬,28,7,13:30:57
Ben Fickes,I know theyâre probably not that fast acting but by any chance did the meds help?,83,16,13:28:26
Ben Fickes,Yes indeed. Man cannot wait for it to be done haha,50,11,13:28:04
Erica Yee,Which is next Wednesday?,24,4,13:27:35
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica :) my next deadline is the 24th for that class so will definitely not work on it until after game engines is done,126,25,13:26:21
Erica Yee,i know you're working really hard on it,39,8,12:35:56
Erica Yee,nice!!,6,1,12:35:51
Ben Fickes,I presented in games and social justice. I saw the professors computer and he took a note of âreally nice prototypeâ haha,125,22,12:30:29
Erica Yee,no rush,7,2,12:18:19
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow, nice Tuesday Fridays haha. Iâll send mine later today",63,11,11:44:30

Erica Yee,watching the april 1 extra credits vid (what else to do when sick) and laughing so much xD thanks,97,19,11:19:17
Erica Yee,Yeah hopefully,14,2,10:42:13
Ben Fickes,Well on the bright side that means she expects you to be better by Thursday?,76,15,10:27:02
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,10:26:45
Erica Yee,"Lol my mom says if I'm not better by Thursday, we need to switch meds. Guess my body has a deadline",99,21,10:26:10
Erica Yee,Yeah let's not have a repeat of last year,41,9,10:25:29
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Hopefully he enjoys it and takes the flight back haha,61,11,10:02:06
Erica Yee,Weekish I think,15,3,10:01:31
Ben Fickes,"Wow glad you did, how long is he there for then?",48,11,9:45:47
Erica Yee,I made sure he bought a return ticket lol,41,9,9:45:10
Erica Yee,Victor just booked a flight to Brazil in November,49,9,9:44:58
Ben Fickes,Okay. I really hope they help. And I can definitely do that haha,64,13,9:41:17
Erica Yee,Haha I would appreciate just hanging with you without coughing,62,10,9:37:20
Erica Yee,Hmm it might've taken a bit to fall asleep. And yeah I will see what my mom says. Just got the text that the meds are ready so I'll get them soon,145,32,9:36:51
Ben Fickes,Honestly when you get better you deserve a party haha,53,10,9:29:02
Ben Fickes,Dang. Iâm so sorry. Did you fall asleep right away? And if the meds donât start helping will you get this checked out?,122,23,9:28:48
Erica Yee,Sleep so long and honestly don't feel rested yikes,50,9,8:51:31
Erica Yee,Ooooh I'm excited too,21,4,8:51:03
Ben Fickes,I know youâre asleep but just wanted to say Iâm excited to show you my game for g+sj sometime haha,102,20,0:28:29
Ben Fickes,I know haha,11,3,22:17:40
Erica Yee,Dang nice!!,11,2,22:15:16
Erica Yee,She seems very outgoing so we'll see but yeah haha,50,10,22:15:11
Ben Fickes,Unrelated to anything but I think Josh is at Activision rn? He sent a snap,74,15,22:08:58
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think if your body is telling you to rest you should listen haha. And nice! Glad it seems like your one unknown roomie will be good :),141,29,22:08:43
Erica Yee,Also currently bonding with Maya (our future roommate) over the public policy class I wanted to take because she's taking it in the summer so yay?,146,26,22:04:10
Erica Yee,I do have stuff if I felt like it but it's been a long day,58,15,22:03:35
Erica Yee,Haha ok ok,10,3,22:03:16
Ben Fickes,"Sorry point is please don't feel bad about saying you don't have as much work when I do, it doesn't bother me at all haha",121,25,21:58:47
Erica Yee,Ahh ok,6,2,21:57:55
Ben Fickes,After tomorrow I may have a mini respite,40,8,21:56:24
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha! I'm not actually jealous haha, I wish I had less work but am strangely not minding it that much",112,22,21:56:07
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I'm sorry you have so much :(,37,9,21:55:19
Ben Fickes,"Haha well I am jealous of that, but yeah doesn't hurt to rest more",66,14,21:53:09
Ben Fickes,"Oh that was in reference to your dad and Sophie, respectively. You do not strike me as someone who wants to be famous haha. But yeah I still remember your soccer dream book haha",177,34,21:52:33
Erica Yee,I legit don't have anything to do tonight so I might just sleep lmao,68,14,21:51:53
Erica Yee,But I do have ideas about sport romance plots hehe,50,10,21:51:32
Erica Yee,No I'm actually kidding xD have no desire whatsoever to have even a little fame,79,15,21:51:16
Ben Fickes,"Wow are you implying it's too late in life for me to become a professional basketball or soccer player? Thanks for sharing haha. Gotcha, thanks for sharing that too. And okeydokey, no pressure again though if things are not looking like you'll be free",251,44,21:49:53
Erica Yee,"I probably will on Sunday and Monday, it's just Saturday I'll be out with Victor",80,15,21:47:53
Erica Yee,"Nah no specific issues, and dressing up can be fun, but these social events are just not really my thing",104,20,21:47:25
Erica Yee,"(jk jk jk, would rather have a soccer player tbh)",49,10,21:46:43
Erica Yee,There goes my nba wife dreams,29,6,21:46:04
Erica Yee,"Idk, he and my mom are the same height and he's good with it but I imagine it must've been tough growing up as a small kid. So I think it might be weird for him if you were like 6'5"" or something",195,43,21:45:53
Ben Fickes,HAHA okay no problem! I forgot you have roughly zero time this weekend so no worries if you can't,97,19,21:45:05
Erica Yee,Lol sorry my keyboard was suggesting emojis,43,7,21:44:26
Erica Yee,Yes definitely want to but need to play it by ð and ð,59,13,21:44:05
Ben Fickes,"HAHA why does your dad look for that haha. Oh Iâm sorry, anything you wanna talk about? At least youâll have Sophie there",125,23,21:43:50
Erica Yee,"Not really honestly, especially with what she's told me about the people in her frat, but I will support Sophie",111,20,21:43:05
Erica Yee,"Did I tell you my dad was like ""thank you for choosing a guy who's not super tall""",82,18,21:42:37
Ben Fickes,Also for this weekend Iâm gonna have a lot to do for game engines but would love to see you at least one evening if you are able to do that?,142,31,21:40:35
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð Iâm honored you think Iâm tall. Are you looking forward to the dance?,83,15,21:40:05
Erica Yee,This is me on Friday ð,25,6,21:38:53
Erica Yee,Sarah Chou,10,2,21:38:44
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,21:38:34
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well hope the antibiotics take care of it right away,60,11,21:33:46
Erica Yee,Sinus infection maybes,22,3,21:31:55
Ben Fickes,"That's definitely not tmi, thank you for sharing. I just hope you feel better (as always). Do you have any idea what you have?",126,24,21:29:11
Erica Yee,Honestly was feeling worse this morning cuz every time I breathed I could feel the mucus bubbling (lol sorry tmi) but that went away thankfully,143,25,21:28:30
Erica Yee,Yeah I'll get the partial supply tomorrow and did get cough drops,65,12,21:27:28
Ben Fickes,Are you feeling any better/worse health wise?,45,7,21:23:41
Ben Fickes,"Oh glad rehearsal was good! Sorry about CVS, can you get it tomorrow? And did you get cough drops?",98,19,21:23:29
Erica Yee,But worship team rehearsal was good. All 4 of us could make it and we decided preliminary songs and keys,104,20,21:22:44
Erica Yee,I'm ok. Salty at the CVS pharmacy for not giving me the pills they had even if they couldn't give me all of it today (my mom yelled at them yikes),146,31,21:22:20
Erica Yee,Ooh gotcha,10,2,21:21:43
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,21:20:30
Ben Fickes,Theoretically I could fine tune it. Realistically I have other work to do so Iâm gonna work on game and social justice (due by tomorrow class). Probably thereâll be a Systems extension so maybe Iâll fix it tomorrow night but weâll see,242,42,21:20:25
Erica Yee,So you're done?,15,3,21:16:42
Erica Yee,Omg nice!!,10,2,21:16:40
Ben Fickes,So I have all tests passing in systems. Thereâs definitely some weirdness (basically continued use of the file system will cause everything to go wrong) but maybe they wonât notice that haha,194,32,20:43:52
Ben Fickes,HAHA oh my goodness I can picture that so clearly,49,10,18:42:41
Erica Yee,Also our future roommate called b Barbara in a follow-up email and now b doesn't like her ð,94,18,18:16:35
Ben Fickes,"Oh awesome! Sounds good! Sorry about the amoxicillin, hope it helps you feel better though",90,15,18:01:21
Erica Yee,Also giving her your number and she said it was ok you visiting in August,73,15,18:00:53
Erica Yee,Called my mom. she said i sound terrible and is calling in amoxicillin whoo,75,14,18:00:34
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry I meant the third one not the one doing work haha. Okay Iâll send it over once I finish Systems,108,22,18:00:30
Erica Yee,No this is the really good teammate lol (our third person is the slacker and he's the one presenting next week so uhh,117,23,17:59:04
Erica Yee,I'll send you my schedule when I get a chance to (want to see yours too),72,16,17:58:42
Ben Fickes,Oh and are you doing nightshift or something else?,50,9,17:44:07
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! What are you going to do about the other class? And is this the teammate (the one who didn't do the work) the prof said to talk to him about if you had issues?,168,36,17:43:49
Erica Yee,Also my good teammate and I wrote our proposal in like an hour which is way not enough thought but we'll see what the professor says ð¬,137,27,17:42:44
Erica Yee,But got the others including the grad class and then the building a better book honors seminar,94,17,17:42:00
Erica Yee,Did not get the Dukakis class because didn't see you had to take intro to poli sci lmao,87,18,17:41:44
Erica Yee,Nice!,5,1,17:41:27
Ben Fickes,Lemme know how yours go,23,5,15:19:56
Ben Fickes,Got my class,12,3,15:19:36
Erica Yee,I'm under the stairs,20,4,13:13:59
Erica Yee,V crowded,9,2,13:13:04

Ben Fickes,Well at least you got some sleep. Hope you can eat something too,64,13,14:54:27

Ben Fickes,Iâll ask all about your day and dinner when I see you :),58,13,19:10:11
Ben Fickes,"I donât think youâll be intruding, Iâll check with John though. Enjoy dinner! Run was amazing, it was so nice out, I went pretty far along the Charles. I just had dinner with Michael at Panera and saw Vivian Lee walk by haha",230,43,19:09:51

Erica Yee,Ok thanks for the heads up! I don't want to intrude either so we'll see,71,15,19:08:36
Ben Fickes,As a heads up John invited Sabrina over for pizza or something? Idk the details and idk if sheâll be over by the time you come over but just as a heads up,156,33,19:03:19
Ben Fickes,Yeah it looked nice according to my phone haha so I'll be happy to be out there,79,17,12:29:06

Erica Yee,Aww ð think we're doing dinner at 7 near South station so not too far. Hopefully back by 9ish?,97,19,12:06:45
Ben Fickes,I typed âerrorsâ instead of âhoursâ at first so clearly homework is on my mind haha,91,16,11:50:15
Ben Fickes,Do you know when you want to meet up tonight? Not for planning at all because I have no plans but solely for counting down hours haha,133,27,11:49:53
Erica Yee,Yeah hopefully,14,2,11:44:30
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure heâll be fine and whatever happens will be for the best. Either it goes bad and itâs good they donât date or it goes well and hopefully they can figure out something good right? Know thatâs oversimplifying it haha,232,41,11:42:38
Erica Yee,Ahh I'm a bit stressed for him now,34,8,11:40:47
Ben Fickes,HAHA I never noticed that and now canât stop laughing at it,61,12,11:38:46
Erica Yee,Omg the number of exclamation points decrease each time,55,9,11:38:13
Ben Fickes,Okay mine is kinda weird because I thought I would forget today so I told him yesterday but then I remembered today so I told him today too haha,144,29,11:36:39
Erica Yee,What did he say lol,19,5,11:36:07
Ben Fickes,Oh I thought he had the same reply to me but he didnât haha,61,14,11:35:16
Ben Fickes,Wait haha just a sec,20,5,11:34:57
Ben Fickes,Wait can I see please haha,26,6,11:31:04
Erica Yee,Yikes that was more emotion than I usually have/show but I am invested in him and I think he will appreciate,108,21,11:30:49
Erica Yee,Haha ok I'll message him,24,5,11:27:17
Ben Fickes,I remember you saying that haha. And I have a story about that haha,67,14,11:26:05
Erica Yee,Ok I might say something similar because I hate saying good luck,64,12,11:25:41
Ben Fickes,Donât wanna hype up his decision if that makes sense but want him to know we care,83,17,11:25:36
Ben Fickes,But idk,7,2,11:25:12
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm I did, just saying âI hope things go wellâ",51,10,11:24:59
Erica Yee,Should I?,9,2,11:24:42
Erica Yee,But didn't know if I should message him,39,8,11:24:35

Ben Fickes,No worries haha. We have no chore chart so everything always a mess here. And gotcha,84,16,10:13:45

Erica Yee,also unrelated but i'm listening to my kpop playlist again and i know you asked what songs i like. i will tell you the name of this song because i think it's very funny and dramatic.,182,36,18:10:34

Ben Fickes,What are some funny parts so far?,33,7,18:00:38
Ben Fickes,I feel like if I read romance books I would appreciate humor over drama so Iâd like that one,94,19,18:00:30
Erica Yee,this book is so funny i'm laughing on the fourth floor of snell,63,13,17:59:38

Erica Yee,Thanks ð¬,11,2,13:27:35
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness thatâs amazing Erica! I guess your reputation precedes you,75,12,13:17:36
Erica Yee,also yeah he knows me but he's never seen any of my work so i think this may be some unfounded faith xD,103,23,12:12:52
Erica Yee,"""Erica, second thought: no need to meet (unless you want to). 

Susan, I know Erica. She will be great in the Data Storytelling class, so pls sign her up. """,156,30,12:11:20
Erica Yee,the emotional energy i invested in the last hour...,51,9,12:11:10
Erica Yee,OMG,3,1,12:11:00
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,12:10:54
Ben Fickes,Yeah hopefully you can make IV again haha,41,8,11:48:55
Erica Yee,"If I do this class it's the 3 hour evening block again, but on Thursdays thankfully",83,16,11:29:07
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,11:28:48
Ben Fickes,Lemme know what your schedule ends up looking like,50,9,11:24:59
Erica Yee,gotcha,6,1,11:22:45
Ben Fickes,2 pm I believe,14,4,11:20:03
Ben Fickes,Also Monday,11,2,11:19:54
Erica Yee,when's yours?,13,2,11:17:21
Erica Yee,registration is on monday though so idk if i can talk with him before lol,73,15,11:17:09
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow, hope the meeting goes well. Donât feel like you have to take it if you donât want to, you shouldnât be pressured into it. But if you do want to I hope youâre able to!",182,37,11:16:14
Erica Yee,i was not even for sure going to take this class but guess i have to now after going through all this lol,105,23,11:14:51
Erica Yee,"and she forwards my email to prof carroll like ""you need to talk to him."" and now he wants to meet up in person to talk about it???",131,28,11:14:28
Erica Yee,"as i'm planning for registration on monday, i realize for the first time that it's actually a grad course. so i email the journalism academic advisor like ""i'm interested in taking a grad-level course, would this be possible""",225,38,11:14:06
Erica Yee,"when he guest lectured at my class last week he encouraged people to sign up for his class. so i emailed him afterward just to connect and was like "" just letting you know i'm interested, hope to see you in the fall""",216,43,11:12:44
Erica Yee,lol you sound like me,21,5,11:11:51
Erica Yee,did i tell you about the data journalism class i want to take next semester with matt carroll,93,18,11:11:42
Ben Fickes,OMG,3,1,11:11:28
Erica Yee,omg,3,1,11:11:12
Erica Yee,oh nice haha,12,3,11:09:57
Ben Fickes,No those were my thoughts exactly on both (though canât remember if I cried at all at rogue one),98,19,11:05:27
Erica Yee,yes loved rogue one (definitely cried at the end) and thought han solo was eh (but i have no emotional connection to growing up with the character so probably why haha),168,31,11:04:14
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. Have you seen the Rogue One and Han Solo movies?,59,12,11:00:15
Erica Yee,Actually first 3 years of college winter break it was a tradition for me to go with Calvin's group of hs guy friends (who I knew but weren't super close with) to see the new ones which was really fun. But then one didn't come out last break haha,245,49,10:56:50
Erica Yee,So I watched with friends,25,5,10:55:33
Erica Yee,"My parents never showed them to us and then when the new movies started coming out they were like ""how could you not have seen the old star wars movies??"" ð",159,31,10:54:38
Erica Yee,But the player is so charming ð,34,7,10:54:05
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. If that meme is from a movie it's probably 2 or 3,60,14,10:52:18
Erica Yee,Ohh right!,10,2,10:52:15
Ben Fickes,"Ah gotcha. Sorta, Xalfer is mentioned but the bigger thing is that you find out Tylux is dead early on. And haha no I also do not usually approve of relationships with player dudes haha",185,35,10:51:56
Erica Yee,"And I've seen 1, 4-new ones. So not clones and revenge",54,11,10:51:48
Erica Yee,Also she ends up with the good studious guy instead of the player surfer dude which I appreciate (I'm so judgy lol),115,22,10:50:52
Erica Yee,Yeah didn't you say you mention xalfer early on or something,60,11,10:50:15
Erica Yee,Kind of? Like it's someone she meets organically through school but they end up being put on a blind date at the end after they already realized their feelings,159,29,10:50:04
Ben Fickes,Wait I love it when people do that,34,8,10:49:48
Erica Yee,The author also put a spoiler prologue that you don't realize till the very end which I thought was very clever,111,21,10:49:12
Ben Fickes,I'm assuming you ship her with one of the 29 haha,49,11,10:48:47
Erica Yee,V cheesy but cute. I ship haha,30,7,10:48:25
Ben Fickes,All the movies? Which ones have you seen? And what did you think of the book?,77,16,10:48:25
Erica Yee,Finished the book! It was pretty short,38,7,10:48:09
Erica Yee,I haven't seen all of them (but also wouldn't know anyway probably haha),72,13,10:48:00
Ben Fickes,Maybe a tv series not a movie?,30,7,10:46:23
Erica Yee,Ooooh gotcha,12,2,10:46:20
Ben Fickes,Star Wars Iâm pretty sure haha,32,6,10:46:10
Erica Yee,I don't recognize it,20,4,10:46:04
Erica Yee,Oh no like the top panel,24,6,10:45:58
Ben Fickes,The u/? Idk it was there on the FB post haha,44,11,10:45:49
Erica Yee,Lol what is the top from,24,6,10:45:22
Ben Fickes,"Haha nice! Would say I'm surprised you're already almost done but that's a lie, I've learned this is pretty standard for you haha",129,23,10:16:57
Erica Yee,"Yep, I'm about to try to finish the book I'm reading now before I do any work x)",80,18,10:07:23
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. Know you have stuff going on today but hope you get to rest too,76,16,10:06:06
Erica Yee,Hahaha yes that is my prayer too,32,7,9:53:53
Erica Yee,I hope so too ð¬,18,5,9:53:35
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Reminds me, I asked her to pray for you to get better (and other stuff) and she added into the prayer âLord, please keep Ben from getting sickâ haha",160,30,9:50:49
Ben Fickes,Wait do you feel better though?  If you thought you were better and then coughed some during class that still seems like an improvement. Or maybe Iâm desperate for an improvement haha. And haha if youâre gonna be sick might as well take down the prof too,258,47,9:50:04
Erica Yee,But gotta be on campus right after for group project anyway and who knows if I'll be busier next week so think I'll still meet up,129,26,9:49:18
Erica Yee,Christine just texted asking if I wanted to reschedule after what you told her I think,86,16,9:48:53
Erica Yee,Prof was also losing his voice though lol,41,8,9:48:23
Erica Yee,I woke up and thought I was a lot better then started coughing again during class so eh,87,18,9:48:09
Ben Fickes,"Once again, how are you doing haha",34,7,9:33:41
Ben Fickes,Okay haha sounds good. No problem :),36,7,22:12:54
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,22:12:17
Erica Yee,Maybe I'll try it this weekend if I grow increasingly desperate,63,11,22:12:14
Erica Yee,Ohh ok,6,2,22:11:52
Ben Fickes,Itâs like 16x a daily serving of vitamin c haha. (Vitamin c is water soluble though so itâs not toxic to have extra). Anyways I know you canât have citrus so thought it might be a nice way to get vitamin c. But your call. I have some and they have it at cvs I think and maybe even wallostons,297,60,22:08:50
Erica Yee,"Idk, never had it haha",22,5,22:05:11
Ben Fickes,Also do you want emergenc (the vitamin c stuff)?,48,9,22:00:28
Ben Fickes,Yeah you have your 8 am right? I always say this but Iâm sure rest is good,76,17,22:00:12
Erica Yee,Honestly might go to bed soon cuz I have nothing due tomorrow and feel lazy lol,79,16,21:58:58
Erica Yee,Okay sounds good!,17,3,21:58:32
Ben Fickes,Oh very very random but have a God moment to tell you about the worry convo that we had a long time ago. Remembered it on the way home and feel like itâs important to say,172,36,21:56:52
Ben Fickes,We did them in high school some. And yep!,41,9,21:55:35
Erica Yee,Glad the meeting was pretty brief?,34,6,21:51:45
Erica Yee,"Oh interesting, I've never done that haha",41,7,21:51:30
Ben Fickes,"Everyone logs in on their phones like Jackbox and itâs multiple choice, usually for school related stuff",106,17,21:50:03
Ben Fickes,Wait have you never done those?,31,6,21:49:39
Erica Yee,What's a kahoot,15,3,21:39:52
Ben Fickes,There was a freakin kahoot,26,5,21:37:55
Ben Fickes,Meeting just finished,21,3,21:37:48
Erica Yee,K meet you at Huntington x gainsboro,36,7,17:48:02
Ben Fickes,Leaving now,11,2,17:46:32
Erica Yee,Ok cool,7,2,17:18:20
Ben Fickes,As a heads up Iâll be leaving volunteering at 5:45,52,10,17:11:32
Ben Fickes,Here,4,1,14:52:58
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,14:52:36
Ben Fickes,Cool! Omw over now,18,4,14:48:18
Erica Yee,And ohh definitely heard of it but have not seen it,51,11,14:22:55
Erica Yee,Ok np,5,2,14:22:47
Ben Fickes,Also thought of movie I like that you may not have seen (itâs weird though): Napoleon Dynamite,96,17,14:21:35
Ben Fickes,Probably gonna be there close to 2:45 as I have not showered yet,64,13,14:21:07
Erica Yee,haha ok,7,2,12:13:20
Ben Fickes,But if itâs hot at volunteering I might have to be more careful haha,70,14,12:12:10
Ben Fickes,Jk haha hmm Iâll think about it. Normally when itâs cold (I.e. Iâm not gonna sweat through a shirt) I donât wear anything underneath my button downs,156,27,12:11:54
Ben Fickes,Guys actually wear 5-7 layers underneath their button downs,59,9,12:11:17
Erica Yee,"you can also drop it off with the chocolate if you want to wear a tshirt underneath or something (idk, just guessing how guys clothes works lol)",144,27,12:10:39
Erica Yee,haha ok,7,2,12:09:59
Ben Fickes,Eh Iâll do button down. Want your aunt to like me haha,56,12,12:07:43
Erica Yee,lol just saw your snap. i think gray long sleeve would be good if you don't want to wear button down to volunteering,116,23,12:06:56
Ben Fickes,Oh sure thing!,14,3,12:03:42
Erica Yee,haha ok,7,2,12:02:55
Erica Yee,remind me to tell you about my bot exercise in class cuz it's pretty funny/cool,79,15,12:02:53
Ben Fickes,I was going to send a snap asking you what you think and I think itâs funny so Iâm gonna send it anyways,108,23,12:02:43
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good :),19,4,12:02:12
Erica Yee,i think button down,19,4,12:01:57
Ben Fickes,Yeah I wanna make a good first impression haha. I have my long sleeve shirts I wear sometimes?,94,18,11:58:13
Erica Yee,do you have something in between a tshirt and buttondown haha,61,11,11:55:27
Erica Yee,i don't think they expect us to dress up but also could be nice?,64,14,11:55:00
Erica Yee,hm i'm wearing a semi nice sweater,34,7,11:54:43
Ben Fickes,Also do you think a button down is appropriate for dinner or too much,69,14,11:51:19
Ben Fickes,Awesome!,8,1,11:51:07
Erica Yee,yup,3,1,11:50:37
Ben Fickes,Oh if I stop by somewhere in the ballpark of 2:30-2:45 is that okay?,68,14,11:49:34
Ben Fickes,I blame my reaction on info from you haha. Hope your class goes well!,69,14,11:49:09
Erica Yee,Yah he wanted to stop and chat but I was like sorry gotta get to class,70,16,11:42:43
Erica Yee,"OKAY I was going to say something like ""yay apparently he's going to class"" but thought that would be mean ð",111,21,11:42:26
Ben Fickes,Thanks. And whoah haha glad he's going to class! Did he/you say hi,66,13,11:41:32
Erica Yee,Lol I just saw Victor in the wild (for the first time??) on the way to class,76,17,11:41:09
Erica Yee,Ah ok glad he was willing to talk to you about it and that you are there for him,80,19,11:40:45
Ben Fickes,"Yeah sorry that was a lot out of nowhere. I hope he's okay too. I think... he's mentally prepared, which is still kinda sad. But we talked some about it which I hope helped",172,34,11:32:57
Erica Yee,Hope he's alright whatever happens :/,37,6,11:31:58
Erica Yee,Omg ok,6,2,11:31:25
Ben Fickes,So in short I do not know if he will feel like helping me with Systems this weekend,83,18,11:29:13
Ben Fickes,And have not gotten to tell you this and technically he asked me to say nothing so please do not repeat this and I am going to be super vague but Michael is planning on asking someone out on Saturday and believes he is going to be shot down. There is a lot more to this so this is going to sound terrible but I think he will be too,331,70,11:28:45
Ben Fickes,"So I might ask Michael for help, but that won't be until Saturday",65,13,11:27:45
Ben Fickes,"No this is the individual one, we build off of it next week for partner",71,15,11:27:30
Erica Yee,Is it partner?,14,3,11:27:10
Erica Yee,Aw noooo I'm sorry :(,21,5,11:27:06
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but this systems assignment looks really terrible... have just been trying to figure out how to start for an hour,128,22,11:24:00
Ben Fickes,I definitely have not haha,26,5,11:19:12
Erica Yee,I will! Idk if I've ever read a contemporary book about a Korean international in the states,92,17,11:18:10
Erica Yee,HAHA oh yeah 27 dresses,23,5,11:17:43
Ben Fickes,"I think you mentioned this books title but not itâs plot. Or maybe Iâm thinking of the dresses one haha. Let me know what your thoughts are, sounds interesting",163,29,11:16:22
Erica Yee,"Called 29 dates. About a high schooler from Seoul whose parents ship her to San Francisco for senior year cuz her grades aren't great, but still keep having a matchmaker set her up with dates",191,35,11:14:50
Ben Fickes,Oh what book?,13,3,11:10:01
Erica Yee,I just started reading one of the books I got off the hold list cuz there's people waiting for it haha. Feels weird after not reading for the past few weeks but I have more time now yay,185,38,11:09:45
Erica Yee,Ooooh,5,1,11:08:17
Ben Fickes,Might be doing something with Victor next week? Idk he asked if I was free and I said I was and have not made any plans yet,123,27,10:56:46
Erica Yee,Ahh ok,6,2,10:32:36
Ben Fickes,"I also havenât watched movies much, because I rarely did with friends and never felt like it on my own",104,20,10:14:13
Ben Fickes,Iâll think on movies,22,4,10:12:37
Ben Fickes,Hmmm thatâs really hard. I canât remember a lot of them off the top of my head. I liked the LOTR movies (of course). Donât usually rewatch movies. And there are definitely Disney movies I like that I would rewatch but Iâm sure youâve seen all of them haha,265,49,10:12:31
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Would be down for both movies haha, Iâm excited to see the ones you like and hear your perspective",108,20,10:11:11
Erica Yee,I know you probably don't have favorites but what movies have you really enjoyed/would watch again?,99,16,10:10:32
Erica Yee,"There's this Korean movie called ""my girlfriend is a secret agent"" that I also want to watch with you sometime because it's so funny and I would watch over and over. But have only sketchily streamed it so need to find it again haha",231,44,10:09:59
Erica Yee,It's weird cuz I didn't think I'd like it do much. It's very 90s/00s and very teenage with some crude humor lol. But it's such a good movie and apparently very faithful to the Shakespeare play (I haven't read),209,39,10:08:37
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow. Letâs definitely watch 10 things sometime then, I wanna see it if you like it so much haha",100,20,10:02:10
Erica Yee,"Think p&p, 10 things, and Hercules are probably my top 3",56,11,9:57:44
Erica Yee,HAHA you should go into film journalism,39,7,9:57:19
Ben Fickes,That's like 2 years for every 1thing,36,7,9:54:43
Ben Fickes,Dang nice,9,2,9:54:26
Erica Yee,Whoa it just had it's 20th anniversary last month,49,9,9:53:48
Erica Yee,10 things definitely,20,3,9:53:31
Ben Fickes,"Which do you like better, that or 10 things",43,9,9:51:08
Ben Fickes,Ah I see. And yeah I've heard it's good haha,44,10,9:51:00
Erica Yee,Not a must-see imo but it is a legitimately good rom com haha,61,13,9:50:30
Erica Yee,That gif from Ariana's music video is a reference to the movie,62,12,9:49:47
Ben Fickes,Why do you ask haha,19,5,9:47:04
Ben Fickes,"I have not, I know the general plot though",42,9,9:46:56
Ben Fickes,Wow please don't tell me I'm your ex now haha,45,10,9:46:48
Erica Yee,Omg have you seen legally blonde,32,6,9:45:46
Ben Fickes,Well I said that twice oh well,30,7,9:37:15
Ben Fickes,Thanks :) thank you for appreciating haha,41,7,9:37:03
Erica Yee,"I know, I appreciate :)",23,5,9:36:10
Ben Fickes,Idk clubbing is my ideal picture of rest. And thatâs true. Sorry I know youâre taking care of yourself I just want to help and alas know just about nothing about the human body haha,185,35,9:32:41
Erica Yee,And eh I don't know what they could tell me beyond what my mom can tell me,74,17,9:29:03
Erica Yee,Ok we can see haha,18,5,9:28:38
Erica Yee,Definitely more restful than clubbing anyway,44,6,9:28:31
Ben Fickes,Iâm so sorry. I hope you feel better (as always). I know I asked this before but do you think you should get it checked out? And okay sounds good :) if you want to hang out and not talk we can watch a movie or something again,227,48,9:26:59
Erica Yee,I do want to rest but also I feel like us hanging is relatively restful? Maybe not for my voice but otherwise haha,114,23,9:25:56
Erica Yee,The same tbh lol,16,4,9:25:05
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling today?,26,5,9:07:28
Ben Fickes,Definitely did not communicate this well but if you also want to just rest rather than getting together this weekend thatâs a-ok,130,22,0:29:05
Erica Yee,Oh ok,5,2,22:22:55
Ben Fickes,On my way! Up,13,4,22:22:36
Ben Fickes,Here!,5,1,22:21:32
Erica Yee,Lemme know when you're here,27,5,22:19:25
Ben Fickes,Okay haha just take are of yourself please,42,8,22:18:14
Erica Yee,I'm not sleeping anytime soon since I stayed in bed till like 1 today,69,14,22:15:05
Erica Yee,Yeah ofc haha,13,3,22:14:51
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm assuming you wonât suddenly 180 and say I canât come so Iâm gonna head over haha,97,18,22:14:35
Ben Fickes,Also I love an excuse to see you haha,37,9,22:12:34
Ben Fickes,If you really donât mind it would be great if I can come over because I would like to be able to google things haha,117,25,22:12:26
Erica Yee,"i'm doing work, sophie is too but going to bed soon, b just got home, claire is in bed watching vids haha",105,22,22:11:29
Erica Yee,no hassle,9,2,22:10:49
Ben Fickes,How much of a hassle would it be? Because I have some offline work I can definitely do if that would be simpler,111,23,22:09:58
Erica Yee,you can come over if you need internet,38,8,22:08:34
Erica Yee,oh no :(,8,3,22:08:18
Ben Fickes,Idk if you can even receive this message but our internet went down haha,72,14,22:07:48
Erica Yee,ðð i wish,15,3,21:58:25
Ben Fickes,I can imagine you body checking everyone out of the way as you take the winning shot,84,17,21:56:13
Ben Fickes,Wow thereâs so much I donât know about you Erica,52,10,21:55:53
Erica Yee,lol my friend tiffany just messaged that she had a dream our friend group all visited me at northeastern because i was captain of the ice hockey team ?!?!,154,29,21:55:06
Ben Fickes,No problem!,11,2,21:55:04
Erica Yee,thanks :P,9,2,21:54:15
Ben Fickes,Sounds good. And oh my goodness I hope you can rest some (I know I keep saying that but just want you to feel better haha),122,26,21:51:42
Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,21:50:52
Erica Yee,i couldn't really breathe through my nose but otherwise fine haha,65,11,21:50:38
Erica Yee,us,2,1,21:49:58
Erica Yee,lol i would like it to be a gift from both of use,49,13,21:49:57
Ben Fickes,"Menâs was good. Me, Jason, Dara, Shem. Had some good discussion about passage and then following Jesus in the context of giving things up, especially comforts",160,26,21:33:53
Ben Fickes,"Okay so hear me out: if I donât Venmo request you, itâs truly a gift from me haha. Or I guess since it is a gift from both of us I can request you half?

Gotcha. How are you feeling now?",190,41,21:33:21
Erica Yee,How was men's,13,3,21:21:55
Erica Yee,It was ok. Had some good discussion but think everyone was pretty tired,71,13,21:21:50

Erica Yee,oh yah you're still good with getting the chocolate?,52,9,18:01:40
Erica Yee,she says no rush haha,21,5,17:37:16
Ben Fickes,Might be able to get out by 5:45 which would probably give me time,66,14,17:37:00
Ben Fickes,Okay hmmm may be able to do that,32,8,17:36:39
Erica Yee,"ok ideally we catch the 5:58 at hunt x gainsboro, but i'll tell her we may be a bit late",88,20,17:31:38
Ben Fickes,"Thanks :) my volunteering gets done at 6, I might be able to leave slightly earlier than that",93,18,17:27:52
Erica Yee,when can you get back from volunteering?,40,7,17:09:19
Erica Yee,i can tap you,13,4,17:08:18
Erica Yee,ok let's take the bus,21,5,17:08:16
Erica Yee,oh wait i just reread and there's no transfer with the bus like i originally thought,84,16,17:08:15
Ben Fickes,Oh but also Ty has my Charlie card still haha,45,10,16:56:55
Ben Fickes,"Iâm definitely good with either. I would say my normal preference would be to take the bus, since itâll be spending time together and doesnât have to inconvenience her. But if it would tire you out more at all since youâre sick letâs accept a ride",257,46,16:56:46
Erica Yee,What do you think,17,4,16:55:00
Erica Yee,Ahh I don't want to take bus but I also don't want her to have to pick us up,76,19,16:54:58
Ben Fickes,Iâll be where I normally am since I donât know which exit you take haha,75,15,16:35:10
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey!,10,1,16:34:28
Erica Yee,Ok going to bathroom then I'll be out,37,8,16:30:52
Ben Fickes,I can walk back with you if youâre up for that,48,11,16:14:09
Ben Fickes,Sounds good!,12,2,13:51:51
Erica Yee,Sure 225 at corner?,19,4,13:48:33
Ben Fickes,Do you want to walk together either before or after class? If not because of the presentation or anything else thatâs completely fine,135,23,13:21:49
Ben Fickes,Oh Iâm so glad. I did see the verse of the day. I hope you continue feeling better and your presentation goes well!,117,23,13:21:18
Erica Yee,Seeing if I can eat now and then should be able to present,58,13,13:16:30
Erica Yee,Lol did you see the verse of the day...me begging God for relief for the past 5 hours. But I know it's all in his timing,120,26,13:16:14
Erica Yee,Finally feeling better now,26,4,13:15:08
Erica Yee,Thank you,9,2,13:15:02
Ben Fickes,And Iâm praying you feel better,33,6,12:52:50
Ben Fickes,Idk if this would help but if you want to present you could tell the prof the situation and ask to leave right after the presentation?,134,26,12:51:23
Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâm so sorry. Is it bad enough you canât present? Maybe you can email your professor and explain the situation (like Iâm sure itâs possible someone would be super sick and itâd be the same thing). Would they let you postpone presenting until Monday?,265,46,12:50:10
Erica Yee,Woke up with bad headache and it won't go away... Didn't go to volunteering and need to go to class to present in a few hours but idk what to do since the medicine hasn't helped ugh,181,37,12:06:10
Ben Fickes,Goodnight! :) youâre almost there,35,5,0:14:01
Erica Yee,"Thanks, good night!",19,3,0:05:51
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad :) about the first thing. So sorry about the second. I hope it goes well and you get plenty of rest tonight,118,24,0:02:33
Erica Yee,Lol also just tried practicing my presentation and it's too short and couldn't get through 2 slides without coughing yikes,122,20,23:52:42
Erica Yee,I did smile haha,16,4,23:52:07
Erica Yee,Omg LOL,7,2,23:52:02
Ben Fickes,"Just as an update to hopefully make you smile, Dan sent me a copy of a book called ânot yet marriedâ for me to read for my education haha",141,29,23:45:11
Erica Yee,thanks :),9,2,21:38:08
Ben Fickes,And will do!,12,3,21:32:59
Ben Fickes,"Hope it goes well, Iâm rooting for you and praying for and thinking of you",76,15,21:32:52
Erica Yee,and yeah ok i should work on this project,41,9,21:32:10
Erica Yee,ooh lemme know how that goes,28,6,21:32:00
Ben Fickes,Sorry I know youâre busy but just wanted to let you know Iâm meeting Michael to talk about his talk at Wendyâs before menâs group tomorrow. Made me think about you meeting victor haha,191,34,21:27:46
Ben Fickes,No problem. And gotcha. Can relate with Matt actually. At least she's talking to you about it and going to therapy which both seem to be pluses,143,27,21:22:45
Erica Yee,"just listening is very appreciated, thanks",42,6,21:22:09
Erica Yee,they're still together and seem to be doing well. this identity crisis is why i sorta discouraged her from dating (actually hooking up) with him in the first place. cuz i thought some single time would be good. but eh,217,40,21:21:43
Ben Fickes,Is there anything I can do for you at all,41,10,21:21:42
Ben Fickes,I'm really sorry,16,3,21:21:21
Erica Yee,yeah and they said they would do stuff after their classes ended at 5 but ?,75,16,21:20:37
Ben Fickes,And gotcha. Did she and Sean break up or are they still together,64,13,21:20:27
Ben Fickes,I'm so sorry you have to do all of this Erica,45,11,21:20:09
Ben Fickes,If you have no choice ofc you gotta do what you gotta do but hope it's okay,75,17,21:20:00
Erica Yee,yeah asian jasmine from cnbc,28,5,21:19:53
Ben Fickes,If you can make them write some of it I think that's more fair,62,14,21:19:32
Erica Yee,should i just write this whole thing by myself ugh,50,10,21:19:19
Ben Fickes,"Oh my goodness. Is this the jasmine who was at CNBC? I'm glad she's going to therapy at least, that's a big step. Is her crisis about identity? And oh my goodness I'm so sorry. Are they responsive to messages?",209,40,21:19:18
Erica Yee,omG neither of my other research group members did ANYTHING on the docs for our report due tomorrow,99,18,21:18:19
Erica Yee,this was discussed in between class workshops so hopefully we can talk about it more some other time lol,104,19,21:17:06
Erica Yee,"omg part of class was jasmine wu talking about her existential crisis and going to therapy. i'd heard some of it while in NY, but basically she hasn't been single for 5 years and doesn't know who she is without a partner. so she's been trying to think of/do hobbies for herself",277,52,21:16:41
Erica Yee,thanks for watching haha,24,4,21:15:06
Erica Yee,yeah two of my group members dragged this huge steady cam to the seaport for it,79,16,21:15:01
Ben Fickes,right now,9,2,21:13:42
Ben Fickes,But neither of them are home haha,33,7,21:13:38
Ben Fickes,I told Jason and Dan that instead of playing Smash as a hw break tonight I wanna talk about life,96,20,21:13:32
Ben Fickes,Okay actually just watched it haha looks amazing!!!,51,8,21:13:11
Erica Yee,"no worries, have fun there",26,5,21:12:32
Erica Yee,so professional,15,2,21:12:13
Erica Yee,even if none of the the coding works out we will be proud of this video haha,76,17,21:12:13
Ben Fickes,Okay I'm at DP rn but soon will check it out,44,11,21:12:11
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well hopefully that helps others code more on it?,57,10,21:11:54
Erica Yee,if you have some time you can go to ericayee.com/seaport and see the top opening video -- it's sooo good,104,20,21:11:50
Erica Yee,we're actually going to try to use github so...we'll see how that goes,70,13,21:11:17
Erica Yee,pretty good,11,2,21:11:00
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha. How was class?,25,5,20:42:30
Erica Yee,it's a gui,10,3,19:47:33
Ben Fickes,Itâs Friday night. Donât know how late it will go though. And haha is it not command line? If not I donât think I know how to use it haha,143,30,19:43:47
Erica Yee,currently learning how to use github desktop. goodbye my minimal command line knowledge lmao,92,14,19:39:16
Erica Yee,your spain reunion is friday or sat?,36,7,19:38:58
Erica Yee,yeah def,8,2,19:37:58
Erica Yee,aw i'm glad it was so powerful!,31,7,19:37:56
Ben Fickes,"Michaels talk was amazing. About depression, anxiety, and God. Donât think I can do it justice via text so would love to talk to you about it sometime. I have a lot of thoughts and things to chew on related to it",214,42,19:19:19
Ben Fickes,Oh haha,7,2,19:18:39
Erica Yee,that is also wild lol,21,5,19:15:44
Erica Yee,python -m http.server 8080,26,4,19:15:19
Ben Fickes,"In other news, I just prayed with Abby and Ty for Michael with gangham style playing in the background",102,19,18:08:32
Ben Fickes,Because I have no idea how to and it sounds interesting,55,11,18:01:49
Ben Fickes,Can you show me how to do that sometime please,46,10,18:01:39
Ben Fickes,Whoah that is wild,18,4,18:01:33
Erica Yee,wild.,5,1,17:57:57
Erica Yee,but mine only works when i DON'T use the server (everyone else's only works when they use the server),101,19,17:57:48
Erica Yee,we learned how to set up a server using python to load an external data source,78,16,17:57:18
Erica Yee,ooh ok will save to watch later,31,7,17:56:02
Erica Yee,lol friend showed me the meme and it hought it was funny,56,12,17:55:56
Ben Fickes,Also itâs an April fools joke,31,6,17:49:02
Ben Fickes,Josh sent me this extra credits link. Know youâre in class and also busy so no rush but here it is https://youtu.be/P91a5VCEbt8,129,22,17:48:55
Ben Fickes,Was a little confused why Baal is a cat but Iâll just accept it,65,14,17:38:39
Ben Fickes,Wow thank you for that haha,27,6,17:38:25
Ben Fickes,"Haha well beef and mushrooms are a pretty good pair. And haha hope it turns out good, guess youâll see soon enough",116,22,17:36:16
Erica Yee,i started making it at like 4:45 and didn't have all the ingredients lmao so who knows how it will turn out anyway,114,23,17:30:21
Erica Yee,ohh thanks but it's ok. it's just going to be a super mushroomy beef stew,73,15,17:30:01
Ben Fickes,"Also also if you need beef broth Iâm going to store sometime soon and could get you some, if that would be helpful",116,23,16:47:48
Ben Fickes,Also congrats on submitting the assignment,42,6,16:47:10
Ben Fickes,No problem haha,15,3,16:46:56
Erica Yee,thanks for sharing,18,3,16:34:02
Erica Yee,it's because you don't follow baseball,38,6,16:33:53
Erica Yee,omg lol,7,2,16:33:48
Ben Fickes,(I mean it makes sense because he knows you and doesnât know me very well but still think itâs funny),105,20,15:44:19
Ben Fickes,I think he likes responding to you better than me haha,54,11,15:43:34
Ben Fickes,Know youâre busy but just wanted to share my current convo with Victor haha,77,14,15:42:59
Erica Yee,LOL indeed i did,16,4,14:22:33
Ben Fickes,"Know that this is not the point but I do find it funny you searched ""holding hands"" to find it haha",99,21,14:02:58
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha, thanks for sharing about it",35,6,14:02:15
Erica Yee,don't have to have a big discussion about it now but just wanted to share since we talked about it last night,109,22,13:40:51
Erica Yee,this was march 9,16,4,13:39:56
Erica Yee,yay ok,6,2,13:38:22
Ben Fickes,Yes it is haha. So after 4/17 (two weeks!) at 2:50 my world will be significantly easier haha. And gotcha. Hopefully trip doesnât take all day? Even if it does I know you work a lot during the week so *hopefully* itâs okay,226,43,13:32:43
Erica Yee,lol victor and my trip is 4/13 so i might be not giving myself anytime to do work but oh well want to make this happen,118,26,13:30:18
Erica Yee,is that your final project?,27,5,13:29:52
Erica Yee,ooh ok,6,2,13:29:48
Ben Fickes,I have a big project (game engines) due 4/17 but hopefully can plan and work enough now to be good on 4/14,106,22,13:28:34
Ben Fickes,No problem haha it took me a while to figure out but eventually got there haha,78,16,13:27:44
Erica Yee,thanks for your input xD,24,5,13:27:10
Erica Yee,lol katie and i were discussing the dtl on snapchat which is why it was like the middle of the coversation,106,21,13:27:00
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well glad they're reliable haha. And thanks :),54,9,10:47:44
Erica Yee,will do :),10,3,10:46:59
Erica Yee,"i know the coding group always gets it done, it's just usually much closer to the deadline than i'm comfortable with haha",121,22,10:46:41
Ben Fickes,"Oh no. Iâm sorry about your group. I hope it all gets done, Iâll go to let you work. Please let me know how it goes at some point when itâs convenient for you, even if thatâs tomorrow after itâs all over",213,42,10:45:27
Erica Yee,work is busy today. we need to submit coding assignment as a group before class and people aren't putting their stuff in the drive so i'm getting worried. and then research study assignment due tomorrow + presentatio so ahh,223,39,10:43:30
Erica Yee,think i may have gotten 100% haha,33,7,10:42:13
Erica Yee,ooh ok,6,2,10:41:09
Ben Fickes,How about you? How's your work? And how did the quiz go yesterday?,66,13,10:33:11
Ben Fickes,I think my section is almost taken care of by this starter code so guess I'll do something else for it,102,21,10:32:33
Ben Fickes,"Yep, starting on it now, but just reading code so far that someone else pushed last night",89,17,10:32:13
Erica Yee,how's your work going? can you start on your game engine project yet?,69,13,10:31:37
Ben Fickes,Of course :),12,3,10:27:21
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,10:24:23
Ben Fickes,As always lemme know if there's anything I can do to help,57,12,10:10:01
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Well I guess yeah at least it's not worse. Hope you keep feeling better,82,16,10:09:48
Erica Yee,Which I guess is good but not great haha,40,9,10:09:06
Erica Yee,Honestly the same,17,3,10:08:37
Ben Fickes,Good morning! How are you feeling today?,40,7,9:52:34
Ben Fickes,"Aw that is great! Goodnight, hope you sleep well",48,9,22:58:32
Erica Yee,Anyway I'm gonna go to bed. Thanks for listening to all my ranting,66,13,22:57:47
Erica Yee,We don't talk about faith stuff as much as I'd like and it's usually me nudging so this is a pleasant surprise,110,22,22:57:13
Erica Yee,Aw he just asked if there's any way he could pray for me,56,13,22:56:39
Ben Fickes,Oh I see. I thought maybe he was saying looks and it was some other reason but I guess it is just looks hmm,107,24,22:51:05
Erica Yee,Oh noo he's never met her haha,30,7,22:49:51
Ben Fickes,HAHA nice. And okay I thought his parents' had them eat together (for some reason) and then she fb friended him and he didn't accept,132,25,22:46:58
Erica Yee,No literally she just happened to eat at his parents' restaurant,64,11,22:46:16
Erica Yee,I will gladly give my opinion of approval on someone based on very limited information (usually more than this case here though),128,22,22:45:50
Ben Fickes,Wait so Calvin has never met her in person?,43,9,22:45:26
Ben Fickes,Oh haha I thought you meant accept others' relationships with your blessing,75,12,22:45:14
Erica Yee,Oh also when I said accept earlier I meant Facebook friend requests,67,12,22:44:50
Erica Yee,I'm probably one of 3 people who actually do them usually tbh so it's fine,74,15,22:44:28
Ben Fickes,Maybe you can use them to help you sleep haha,45,10,22:39:08
Ben Fickes,And sorry about your readings,29,5,22:38:58
Ben Fickes,Well that's pretty fair haha. No one ever asks for my approval haha (except my cousin who dated a girl for one week and only communicated with her via snapchat),160,30,22:38:52
Erica Yee,Oh reminds me I have to invite people to the worship night event,64,13,22:37:50
Erica Yee,No that's literally all the information I have on her. Personally I try not to accept people I haven't met in person,116,22,22:37:34
Erica Yee,So eh,5,2,22:36:56
Erica Yee,And the topic is copyright law so I'm definitely gonna fall asleep sleep if I try now,85,17,22:36:54
Erica Yee,Omg just realized I didn't do my readings for tomorrow's class,62,11,22:36:20
Ben Fickes,And gotcha. Do you have other reasons you don't like her or just since he isn't into her it's better to not accept her request,126,25,22:36:03
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,22:35:57
Ben Fickes,Have an interesting story about soul mates - my dad was ardently against believing in soul mates (which is interesting with him being married). Can talk to you about it in person sometime,187,33,22:35:30
Erica Yee,I don't think he accepted her friend request which I approve of but not of his reasons (her looks) haha,103,20,22:34:47
Erica Yee,No one specifically from home I don't think. The other girl he's close with from hs is Tiffany and nothing is gonna happen there,128,24,22:34:06
Ben Fickes,Yeah I gotcha haha. And oh yeah right haha how is that,54,12,22:33:21
Erica Yee,He has the girl his dad tried to set him up with ð,53,13,22:33:02
Erica Yee,Lol idk why I said soul mate i don't even know why that means. But you get what I'm trying to say,97,22,22:32:46
Erica Yee,Obviously I would be happy for him if he found his soul mate or whatever in the next 2 months but I'm hoping he can just focus on finishing his undergrad well,158,32,22:32:30
Ben Fickes,And gotcha. Does he know anyone from back home? Though in general I usually support singleness and not rushing into relationships so I guess maybe not dating is the best thing,175,31,22:31:47
Erica Yee,Yeah,4,1,22:30:54
Ben Fickes,Since the concert you mean right?,33,6,22:30:37
Erica Yee,But don't think they've seen each other since. He's talked about wanting to date (other people in a general sense) but feeling weird about it since he's finishing school so soon and going back home,197,35,22:29:55
Ben Fickes,No I think you're in the right and I would've reacted the same way. I think the bigger thing though is it being a sign of him not distancing himself from their past if that makes sense,184,37,22:29:38
Erica Yee,Maybe shouldn't have been so judgy but I was just so like omg what are you doing am I going to see you get hurt AGAIN,117,26,22:28:21
Erica Yee,Hm actually maybe after I made my surprise/?!?? Known he probably didn't want to tell me more lol,97,18,22:27:50
Ben Fickes,No worries take your time haha,30,6,22:27:11
Erica Yee,Sorry I'm talk to Sophie so am typing very slowly,49,10,22:26:46
Erica Yee,And I don't remember exactly what he said after that and can't search on my phone,81,16,22:26:33
Ben Fickes,Sorry will wait and listen rather than keeping on tslking,57,10,22:26:16
Ben Fickes,Or did you have to tell him,27,7,22:25:56
Ben Fickes,Wait did he think that was an issue,35,8,22:25:50
Ben Fickes,Yeah I thought a lot more !?!?!? haha,37,8,22:25:36
Erica Yee,Except with more ?!?!??,23,4,22:25:22
Erica Yee,My reaction exactly,19,3,22:25:15
Ben Fickes,Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat,34,1,22:24:56
Erica Yee,I asked how their interaction was and he said they freaking HELD HANDS,70,13,22:24:24
Erica Yee,A while ago (a few weeks maybe? I'm losing concept of time) they went to a concert at school together and I was like hmm,120,25,22:22:54
Ben Fickes,Honestly I opened mine but have done nothing and am feeling pretty tired so might just sleep early,98,18,22:21:09
Erica Yee,I wish xD didn't even open my laptop since coming home because I knew there would be no point,93,19,22:20:04
Ben Fickes,No I don't think you did?,25,6,22:18:07
Ben Fickes,"Oh I did not know that, thanks Sophie haha. And also did not know honey was only for unproductive. Your cough is helping you be extra productive haha (okay I had to)",165,32,22:18:01
Erica Yee,"He hasn't mentioned her so I don't think it's affecting him as much, but did I tell you about when they went to concert together?",129,25,22:17:30
Erica Yee,"Also since I have a productive cough I shouldn't take honey, which works as well as cough syrup for unproductive ones but doesn't really help for productive",156,27,22:16:13
Erica Yee,"Learned that cough syrup is a scam because there's two types of coughs, productive and non-productive, and syrup has stuff that counteracts both which cancel each other out. My mom never gave me cough syrup anyway so wasn't using it but yikes",242,42,22:15:11
Ben Fickes,Is that doing better more directly? Like is she still causing problems (hate saying that but can't think of another way to say it),130,24,22:14:17
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,22:13:37
Erica Yee,"Not before the girl drama (that he told me about, but i think he tells me most stuff)",85,18,22:13:16
Ben Fickes,And on a lighter note what did you learn about coughs haha,58,12,22:11:33
Ben Fickes,I'm glad he's doing better now (or says he is). Hopefully time on campus and going to class will help. Not that you have to tell me all about his struggles but does he deal with this sort of stuff a lot?,203,42,22:11:23
Erica Yee,So I'm glad he has that to live for lol (actually though),57,12,22:09:54
Erica Yee,"Anyway he said he's feeling better now though and will go to class tomorrow cuz it's his supreme court class which he ""wouldn't miss for the world""",147,27,22:09:44
Erica Yee,Sophie just learned about coughs in class so lectured me a bit haha,67,13,22:08:41
Ben Fickes,Oh no. Iâm so sorry to hear that. No worries Iâll wait for the rest haha,76,16,22:06:20
Erica Yee,Wait sorry pressed enter too soon when I coughed lol,52,10,22:06:08
Erica Yee,Calvin just told me he skipped his classes today because he was too tired and anxious ð¢,90,17,22:05:34
Erica Yee,Praise to the Lord the almighty the king of creation,52,10,21:39:36
Ben Fickes,Got it!,7,2,21:38:49
Erica Yee,Blue. It should be on the dispenser right in front of uhcs,58,12,21:36:19
Ben Fickes,What color is it again,22,5,21:36:06
Erica Yee,Could you also fill it please haha,34,7,21:35:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing :),18,4,21:35:54
Erica Yee,Omg really? That would be much appreciated,42,7,21:35:35
Ben Fickes,Yikes indeed wow,16,3,21:35:19

Erica Yee,Ok I'm sleeping but we can discuss tomorrow,43,8,23:38:55
Erica Yee,Do you think your place will be free? I really dislike cooking here,67,13,23:38:39
Erica Yee,"""Balancing the right to privacy and freedom of speech and the press is really hard""",83,15,23:37:54
Ben Fickes,I'll check,10,2,23:37:37
Ben Fickes,I'm sorry you've probably told me,33,6,23:37:34
Erica Yee,Do you guys have rice wine,26,6,23:37:28
Ben Fickes,What is the brief summary of your paper haha,44,9,23:37:23
Erica Yee,Thanks for wisdom HAHA,22,4,23:37:13
Erica Yee,"I gave my mom a very brief summary of my paper and she responded ""yes, democracy is a struggle""",95,19,23:37:04
Erica Yee,Lol omg x 2,11,4,23:36:33
Erica Yee,Lol omg,7,2,23:36:21
Ben Fickes,*since heehee,13,2,23:36:19
Erica Yee,I made it a lot when I lived in dp but haven't sense,52,13,23:36:08
Ben Fickes,"Also read "".com"" as "".corn"" and was amazed they had a whole recipe section under corn, and that tomatoes and eggs counted for it",128,24,23:36:06
Ben Fickes,My sad leftovers are veggies. I had no cheese today and had to eat tortillas with veggies and no cheese. Now I'm out of tortillas. So your food sounds amazing haha,163,31,23:35:38
Erica Yee,Ok ok haha,10,3,23:35:36
Ben Fickes,I'm totally down,16,3,23:35:03
Ben Fickes,No I'm telling you I don't dislike tomatoes that much haha,58,11,23:35:00
Erica Yee,We can make something else,26,5,23:34:50
Erica Yee,"Oh wait it's tomatoes, scratch that lol",39,7,23:34:45
Erica Yee,If you're down,14,3,23:34:35
Erica Yee,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018570-chinese-stir-fried-tomatoes-and-eggs,80,1,23:34:26
Erica Yee,I have not cooked all week but I was planning on making this tomorrow,69,14,23:34:24
Erica Yee,Ok!,3,1,23:34:04
Ben Fickes,So we can have a 3:30-4 pre dinner? Or is that too early haha,61,14,23:32:19
Ben Fickes,And so I'll probably want to eat lunch after class,50,10,23:32:03
Ben Fickes,I will probably not be hungry for lunch by 11:15,48,10,23:31:52
Ben Fickes,I will probably run and eat bfast around 11,43,9,23:31:41
Ben Fickes,Okay haha hear me out on this,29,7,23:31:31
Erica Yee,Though I do need to eat a pre dinner at some point,50,12,23:31:20
Erica Yee,Yeah hopefully should be good,29,5,23:31:08
Ben Fickes,But I figured I'd offer Fabricio the choice,43,8,23:29:51
Ben Fickes,Boston Burger is open that late I know haha,43,9,23:29:28
Ben Fickes,Sure! No pressure though. And no psych so does after 3:15 still give you enough time?,85,16,23:29:21
Erica Yee,Beside tasty burger ð,24,4,23:28:47
Erica Yee,What's even open around here then,33,6,23:28:33
Erica Yee,It's probably south station right? So that will take a bit,58,11,23:28:26
Erica Yee,"I definitely need to do a good amount of work tmr since Saturday is gonna be none, but hopefully free after your class?",119,23,23:28:13
Ben Fickes,"Yeah Fabricio arrives at 9:10, though I have a feeling that's when his bus gets in and not when he gets to my apartment",119,24,23:27:33
Erica Yee,Just mentally planning for dinner at like 930 or 10 haha,56,11,23:26:34
Erica Yee,And then where is Fab arriving at 910?,38,8,23:26:19
Erica Yee,Ok,2,1,23:26:08
Ben Fickes,I think itâs 6-7:30 (though end time is loose),48,9,23:12:44
Erica Yee,What time is r&r again,22,5,23:11:44
Ben Fickes,"If youâre feeling up to it tomorrow (and really, only if), when do you wanna hang out?",88,17,23:05:31
Ben Fickes,Hopefully that wonât be too bad though,40,7,23:04:50
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha,9,2,23:04:44
Erica Yee,We have a take-home final for this class though,47,9,23:04:36
Erica Yee,But relieved I guess. It's weird cuz this is like the final project but not due at the end of semester,102,21,23:04:29
Erica Yee,Anticlimactic. I've already checked my sent folder 3 times to make sure lol,75,13,23:03:50
Ben Fickes,How does it feel to have turned it in,37,9,23:02:47
Ben Fickes,No problem :) I canât give you any tangible informational support so moral is the next best haha,98,18,23:02:39
Erica Yee,seriously thanks for all the support :),39,7,23:02:10
Erica Yee,haha thanks,11,2,23:02:00
Ben Fickes,I truly think you're good haha. To be fair I have not read your essay but I'm pretty sure it's not garbage by a long shot,121,26,22:45:53
Erica Yee,not my best work but oh well,28,7,22:45:03
Erica Yee,just thinking about it it's kind of dumb tho because all of what i wrote we haven't learned in class yet (learning about privacy tomorrow LMAO) + we didn't actually learn how to *read* and examine caselaw so i'm just ??,219,41,22:45:00
Ben Fickes,You can do it! Lemme know when you submit,41,9,22:43:18
Erica Yee,quadruple checking names now ð¬,33,5,22:42:31
Erica Yee,ok thanks,9,2,22:42:22
Ben Fickes,"I know nothing's filler so I think it's 3,117 quality words and you're good to submit",85,16,22:39:27
Ben Fickes,I think that's to prevent people who try to turn in 10K word papers,67,14,22:39:00
Ben Fickes,I think you're fine,19,4,22:38:39
Erica Yee,and mine is 3117. do you think that's ok lol,44,10,22:37:08
Erica Yee,"if the instructions are: ""Your paper should be about 2,500 to 3,000 words long. A little shorter or longer is OK. A lot longer is not OK.""",138,27,22:37:04
Erica Yee,hmm i'd say go for it,21,6,22:36:15
Ben Fickes,"yeah I will. Don't know whether to say ""my dad died too"" or not. Seems like a huge personal jump but my high school math teacher told me his dad died when he was 18 after mine did and it meant a lot so idk",205,45,22:35:00
Erica Yee,i think i a brief response of condolences would be appreciated,62,11,22:32:51
Erica Yee,got it,6,2,22:32:39
Ben Fickes,Was cancelled already for next week,35,6,22:31:27
Erica Yee,wait i thought it was already cancelled for week? or was that next week,71,14,22:30:44
Erica Yee,oh no :(,8,3,22:30:33
Ben Fickes,Idk what level of condolences and personal-ness itâs appropriate to reply with,80,12,21:58:20
Ben Fickes,Psych is cancelled tomorrow. My profâs dad died,49,8,21:57:57

Ben Fickes,"Oh that's one thing from ST info meeting, after applying you're supposed to meet with someone from staff or VT to talk about it. So if you do apply I guess talking with her would count probably",193,37,14:33:08

Ben Fickes,Or was this a different day?,28,6,11:43:25
Ben Fickes,I remember you telling me about him! Hope your class with him is good today,75,15,11:43:03
Erica Yee,this journalism professor who was on the globe spotlight team that broke the priest sex abuse story is guest teaching bostonography and he remembered me (though not my name). i never had him but we talked before and i really admire him because he's like the only christian journalist i know lol,294,52,11:41:56

Erica Yee,Hmm yeah sorta like guilty pleasure? Though I don't feel guilty about it,72,13,11:11:00
Ben Fickes,Does you being weak for it mean you really enjoy it? Sorry Iâm clearly not up on the hip lingo so want to make sure Iâm right haha,134,28,11:05:50

Ben Fickes,Okay if you change your mind lemme know. And no pressure to hang out Friday if you're not feeling well or are stressed,118,23,21:22:06

Erica Yee,Small blessing but my new research class group seems pretty good so far,71,13,16:46:05
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Sounds like a solid plan! Glad youâre able to eat something,69,12,13:47:43
Erica Yee,hopefully i'll be hungry by after class and will have early dinner,66,12,13:47:11
Erica Yee,i had a bar for breakfast and have snacked a bit since,54,12,13:46:58
Ben Fickes,Have you eaten yet today?,25,5,13:42:04
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I just hope you feel better (and keep taking care of yourself haha),80,15,13:41:53
Erica Yee,"i thought about that, but probs gonna be on campus till then anyway becuase i'm trying to avoid my apartment..this is all in my head but the more i'm in my bedroom the more germs i feel",185,37,13:38:33
Ben Fickes,Thatâs good! And yeah I guess you have to balance the work but if youâre enjoying it itâs a nice break from other work,124,24,13:38:27
Erica Yee,just met with coding prof and i feel good about our project (though end result is gonna be such a bloated webpage because we're trying to do so much lol). honestly this is the only thing i want to work on right now but telling myself not to becuase it is not the most urgen deadline,282,56,13:37:42
Ben Fickes,Also not to tell you what to do at all but if you donât feel up to even going to enc you could probably swap snack weeks with someone,135,29,13:37:06
Ben Fickes,"Okeydokey, Iâll be praying",28,4,13:36:41
Erica Yee,"thanks, i'll let you know",25,5,13:36:25
Ben Fickes,Okay haha I will definitely do that :) if you do need anything though Iâm happy to help. If you want me to cook/buy you something and drop it off Iâm more than happy to do that,180,37,13:34:18
Erica Yee,like eating just feels distasteful to me right now but i know i should ingest some calories at some point,105,20,13:33:55
Erica Yee,"thanks. really don't want to get you sick so i probably will try to stay away before friday. but if you can just periodically ask if i'm taking care of myself, that would probably be helpful LOL",194,37,13:33:21
Erica Yee,i met him at the potluck in like january i think,48,11,13:32:26
Ben Fickes,If thereâs anything I can do to help you please let me know,61,13,12:30:42
Ben Fickes,Donât know him super well (only from studying in Ryder like twice) but I just have mentioned PAX because he reached out to me about it haha,141,27,12:29:35
Ben Fickes,And yeah I think he goes there,30,7,12:29:10
Ben Fickes,"Okay sounds good, just hope you can relax some",46,9,12:29:02
Erica Yee,Is James the mcp guy,20,5,12:28:09
Erica Yee,I might just drop them off and then leave,41,9,12:28:05
Ben Fickes,"Would rest help? Iâm sure you could send snacks with someone else to enc, or tell your group you feel terrible",112,21,12:26:46
Ben Fickes,Is there anything you can do? Or I can do?,42,10,12:26:21
Erica Yee,"It's ok, thanks for listening",29,5,12:26:00
Erica Yee,But alas things to do,21,5,12:25:56
Erica Yee,Throat is same ok but my head is throbbing now and I can't tell if it's a migraine or sinus,91,20,12:25:52
Ben Fickes,Iâm so sorry,14,3,12:25:51
Erica Yee,I've just decided that I'm feeling pretty awful right now lol,61,11,12:25:27
Ben Fickes,"No worries! Hope your volunteering, group meeting, and enc all go well",70,12,11:01:30
Erica Yee,And would love to but really don't think I have time today between class and enc (which I probably should skip for the sake of work but signed up to bring snacks so will not lol),178,36,10:35:30
Erica Yee,Oh nice! My coding group is meeting with professor at 1230 anyway,65,12,10:34:18
Ben Fickes,No worries haha. Also my class got cancelled today haha so I wonât be walking to or from class today. Would you wanna study together at some point (just because itâs been a bit)? No pressure though at all,208,39,9:50:52
Erica Yee,Jk no time to respond before volunteering,41,7,8:45:56
Ben Fickes,In general I just find it hard to trust the intentions of guys in relationships. Sometimes I ask myself if itâs some sense of competitiveness or something and maybe it is but I think itâs just that Iâve seen (and more heard about) a lot of guys act not great in this regard,279,53,0:27:32
Ben Fickes,Again I have never once met this guy so maybe this is unfair but needless to say I think this is something to be very careful about. Can talk to you more sometime,162,33,0:24:32
Ben Fickes,I think also with âthat type of guyâ there is a âidealâ a lot of men shoot for which is being very confident and smooth but often times that can translate into being aggressive and not taking no for an answer. I am worried he has a goal and everything he does from here out is in pursuit of it and if he thinks itâs possible he wonât back down from it at any point,376,75,0:23:33
Ben Fickes,"No problem, Iâm honored :) hmm I guess one question would be why does she want to be friends with him? I am kinda with you on that I donât think she should really encourage this but also on that itâs her decision. I was trying to figure out with my first questions if itâs about making a friend or having the attention of a boy if that makes sense?",356,70,0:21:22
Ben Fickes,Goodnight! Hope you sleep well,30,5,0:19:22
Erica Yee,Sleeping now but will read tmr if you have response!,52,10,0:19:04
Erica Yee,though honestly my friends and i were not boy crazy which i am very grateful about,82,16,0:02:33
Erica Yee,thanks for your perspective as usual :) where were you in all my high school sleepover girl talks omg,101,19,0:02:09
Erica Yee,"she usually does not want attention (from anyone actually lol) so can be kinda clueless about guys (which is why she brought it up at lunch today. and she has not been in a relationship before. that makes sense about that type of guys, i think i know what you're takling about. she can be VERY not assertive so i am worried she's not gonna clearly shut it down if she feels uncomfortable (that's why ghosting is her MO). and yeah after talking with justin, i don't want her to be friends with him. but i also don't want to judge/force my opinion on someone i've never even met, so idk...",587,111,0:01:36
Ben Fickes,Iâm gonna walk back but if you have more thoughts feel free to send,69,14,23:57:50
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! I got no homework done tonight ugh but hope it helped Vivian,69,14,23:57:19
Erica Yee,"no worries, i did a lot of writing in that time you were listening so yay",73,16,23:56:44
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening haha,25,4,23:54:50
Ben Fickes,And idk how deep the friendship would get,41,8,23:54:46
Ben Fickes,So obviously I do not know this guy at all. But from the sounds of things he reminds me of a certain type of guy (frat boys and/or guys who are really into âpickup artistâ stuff). They are usually very confident and smooth talking (hope this isnât me projecting faults onto more confident guys haha). Between you and me only Matt read a pickup artist book to try to get a girlfriend and it was honestly disgusting. But anyways my guess regardless of all of this is that he is interested in her (idk if in a relationship or just sex). So he probably is not thinking of this as just friendship. And even if Kristy keeps it as âjust friendsâ he will likely still want more (just assuming based on other guys). So idk how much she knows him. My thoughts (depending on what she wants) is she is probably best not engaging at all or being *very* clear and *very* forceful about being just friends,900,167,23:54:38
Ben Fickes,"So, my first question is Kristyâs attitude toward guys. Like idk how else to ask this but does she usually want or not want attention from guys? And do you know if she has been in a relationship before? Sorry just want to know her side of things",247,48,23:45:51
Ben Fickes,Okay so sorry for the late reply. Iâm at DP and Vivian came for FCG planning with Joshua. Actually did not talk about you and me at all but a lot of other stuff sheâs going through (related to John). Anyways just wanted to listen. And now Iâll send my thoughts on Kristyâs guy,284,54,23:43:45
Erica Yee,haha (Y),8,2,22:35:22
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. I will reply soon haha. Vivian just said âSomeone thought you and Erica were dating.â I said âwe are.â And now she wants to know all about it,165,31,22:33:34
Erica Yee,ok the end. hopefully i didn't hype it up too much but thought it was so funny,78,17,22:32:40
Erica Yee,"kristy responded: ""good thing i'm trying to keep this a friends thing"" so i guess she's still gonna get boba with him next week?",128,24,22:32:23
Erica Yee,"so i relay this to the kristy's love life group chat, as well as justin saying he's a fine roommate but would feel creeped out if he were the girls",147,30,22:31:46
Erica Yee,"apparently spam was a random because one of justin's former roommates is co-oping in new york. before meeting him, justin had heard some stories about him. but he thought nah how bad can this guy be? apparently quite! his exact words were: ""my man is MAD THIRSTY"" ðð",272,48,22:30:57
Erica Yee,but THEN justin just messaged me out of nowhere asking if i still had my old laptop charger because his broke and replacement is super expensive. so when he came over to pick it up i got ask him about his roommate,213,42,22:30:10
Erica Yee,and that was that,17,4,22:29:16
Erica Yee,eventually decided she will say yes but probably keep it a friends thing. i was like umm he probably doesn't think so but ok,124,24,22:29:14
Erica Yee,so this afternoon when we were discussing she was like: is he just friendly? is he asking me out? i'm not looking for a relationship. maybe i should just ghost him too,167,32,22:28:14
Erica Yee,"(side note: i think he should've asked in an actual question but she thought ""let's..."" constituted a question so it was fine"")",127,22,22:27:29
Erica Yee,"he added her on fb and she saw justin (my old cs partner) was a mutual friend. turns out spam is justin's suitemate! so they both live in willis. they message a decent amount afterward and he seems really nice. she says she's really busy in the next week, and he says ""after your 3 exams, let's grab boba!""",306,59,22:26:47
Erica Yee,"i'll talk about guy #1 later because he's less interesting and she's ghosting him. BUT guy #2 (i'm dubbing him ""spam"" here because they met at this hawaiian event where she was volunteering and these food nicknames amuse me greatly) approached her and started chatting",268,45,22:24:05
Ben Fickes,What haha,9,2,22:23:46
Erica Yee,omg this is so funny,20,5,22:15:17
Ben Fickes,Oh my wow I am eager to hear haha,33,9,22:00:58
Erica Yee,"re victor, ah ok. since he hasn't talked to this other guy i'm like uhh how do you know..",89,19,21:59:38
Erica Yee,but i will tell you in 15 mins after i rendezvous,49,11,21:58:25
Erica Yee,oh well she didn't go out either of them (yet). but something happened to me that's related,91,17,21:57:56
Erica Yee,or like is going to happen in 15 mins,37,9,21:57:03
Ben Fickes,Also about to play a round of smash so just a sec,49,12,21:56:57
Ben Fickes,Wait what?,10,2,21:56:48
Ben Fickes,"So I think guys do notice other guys feelings/crushes more. I think Victor could be imagining it but also he could be shooting himself down preemptively. My personal thoughts are that itâs not bad to have interest in a girl if another guy does, but I think if the girl is interested in another guy itâs better to back off",325,60,21:56:44
Erica Yee,OMG something hilarious related to kristy's story from earlier just happened,76,11,21:56:36
Ben Fickes,"Staying with taliban member sounds concerning
I love the name kimchimberly haha. I think guys do notice other guys sometime but it could be that itâs in his head. I have more thoughts on this I can send soon in a separate message
And yeah he told me that to my face haha (about hanging out over the summer)",308,59,21:50:51
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing all of that haha. Have some thoughts,55,10,21:47:21
Erica Yee,and yep am eating haha,22,5,21:40:05
Erica Yee,ok this is all i can remember right now,39,9,21:40:02
Erica Yee,"in no particular order, here are things he said tonight
-  if he doesn't have a gf then he can go backpacking in pakistan/afghanistan. sent me a nyt article about how people ""couchsurf"" (app kinda like airbnb) at locals' houses, including (low level) taliban members just for the experience. he thinks it would be really cool bc where else would you get to meet these people
- he has no motivation to talk to kimchimberly (thank you for this name x) right now. plus thinks another underclassmen guy also has a crush on her so he doesn't want to get ruin his chances (do other guys notice these things/feel this way??)
- went to church potluck which was nice and met some more people, but then was all churched out and stayed in bed all day sunday (?!)
- we've been meaning to take advantage of the mbta's $10 round trip weekend commuter rail trips, so might try to go to worcester or somewhere before the end of the semester bc neither of us have been
- he wants to hang with you in the summer because andrew will be gone (lol feel the love)
- he was good hanging with you one-on-one but wouldn't want to with group of iv people ""bc iv is cliquey."" me: ""how"" him: ""idk and i don't even know people but i just think it is"" (ok i was ready to be convicted but nope)",1263,241,21:39:47
Ben Fickes,But also hope you can eat something haha,40,8,21:38:36
Ben Fickes,"If you wanna talk about it Iâm happy to listen, but no pressure",65,13,21:38:28
Erica Yee,also also me: oh yeah you never told ben about that conversation,64,12,21:25:39
Erica Yee,also me: because you had a frosty with victor before class,58,11,21:25:32
Erica Yee,me: why am i just getting hungry now even though i didn't have dinner,69,14,21:25:14
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,21:21:55
Ben Fickes,My mom sent me an article on it too,35,9,21:14:17
Ben Fickes,He did haha,11,3,21:14:10
Erica Yee,Also did Fab sent you his tik tok haha,38,9,21:07:38
Ben Fickes,Oh gotcha,9,2,21:07:05
Erica Yee,Like changing flow/layout of webpage when you resize browser window or view on mobile vs desktop,96,16,21:06:56
Ben Fickes,I feel like you listen a ton so if it was enough to make you want to talk about it I think thatâs a good thing (even if not for your voice),141,32,21:06:38
Erica Yee,One of first things you learn in j school is covering meetings and you always gotta get estimate of attendance,110,20,21:06:27
Erica Yee,Omg thank you ð,18,4,21:06:03
Erica Yee,This should be a lesson in listening better but I learned that I can just not shut up,85,18,21:05:58
Ben Fickes,And whatâs responsive design?,31,4,21:05:56
Ben Fickes,I counted in anticipation of you asking haha. 21 or 22 people roughly,69,13,21:05:44
Erica Yee,But I talked waaaay too much sigh lol,37,8,21:05:25
Erica Yee,Class was cool. Learned about responsive design,47,7,21:05:10
Erica Yee,How was the turnout?,20,4,21:04:57
Erica Yee,Oh ok,5,2,21:04:53
Ben Fickes,How was class?,14,3,21:04:30
Ben Fickes,Really didnât feel like there was anything new at the meeting,63,11,21:04:25
Ben Fickes,It sounds comparable to this year commitment wise,49,8,21:04:03
Erica Yee,Is it gonna be more commitment?,31,6,21:02:41
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,21:02:33
Ben Fickes,Donât know why I said haha,28,6,20:43:41
Ben Fickes,I have a printout I can give you of what we talked about haha,61,14,20:43:34
Ben Fickes,Meeting just finished,21,3,20:43:23
Erica Yee,ohh mb,6,2,19:32:48
Ben Fickes,Me neither haha. Oh we both wanted to talk about it so maybe we can sometime. Meeting is starting in a minute so nothing yet haha,129,26,19:29:23
Erica Yee,what did they talk about in the meeting?,40,8,19:28:04
Erica Yee,but i don't even know what i want to do,39,10,19:27:56
Ben Fickes,No you can just let Christine know haha,39,8,19:23:41
Erica Yee,but yay looking forward to hearing his talk!,44,8,19:14:38
Erica Yee,well guess i won't be on it next year lol,41,10,19:13:49
Erica Yee,i totally forgot,16,3,19:13:32
Erica Yee,OMG the ST meeting,18,4,19:13:28
Ben Fickes,Goin g out to dinner then ST meeting but will tell you about it later,69,15,18:59:20
Ben Fickes,Dans talk was really good. He said I could tell you about it and literally handed me his notes to share with you haha,117,24,18:59:05
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good. Hope your class is good!,42,8,17:43:21
Erica Yee,in a bit,8,3,17:43:00
Erica Yee,he seemed ok. said some very random things that i'll try to remember,68,13,17:42:56
Ben Fickes,Oh huh. How was he?,19,5,17:31:17
Erica Yee,"so victor didn't really even want to talk, he just wanted an excuse to leave work lol",85,17,17:30:55
Erica Yee,LOL (Y) thanks,14,3,17:30:37
Ben Fickes,Notice the wow react,20,4,16:55:04
Erica Yee,And lmao nice,13,3,16:42:54
Erica Yee,I will,6,2,16:42:46
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but saw Barbs and she started skipping toward me which I find really funny haha,94,17,16:39:34
Ben Fickes,Oh that reminds me he said yesterday that he ate ice cream and gummy bears for lunch. He brought it up unprompted so maybe he wants to be told to eat better? Idk just guessing wildly,182,36,16:39:08
Ben Fickes,Heâs away haha. And gotcha hope that goes well. Please let me know how that is. Maybe frosty will soothe your throat haha,123,23,16:38:01
Erica Yee,Which is prob not the most conducive thing to healing but eh friendship,71,13,16:21:09
Erica Yee,Apparently eating Wendy's frostys and talking with Victor soon,62,9,16:20:51
Erica Yee,Why?,4,1,16:20:20
Erica Yee,LOL what is college,19,4,16:20:19
Ben Fickes,And we just got out early,25,6,16:19:08
Ben Fickes,Found out my psych class is cancelled all of next week,54,11,16:19:04
Erica Yee,No it definitely is ð,24,5,14:16:09
Ben Fickes,HAHA sorry I find that really funny maybe I shouldn't,53,10,14:15:33
Erica Yee,Towards them,12,2,14:12:59
Erica Yee,She feels apathetic towards it lol,34,6,14:12:40
Ben Fickes,How does Kristy feel about it in general? Unless that requires going into all the details,89,16,14:05:23
Ben Fickes,Okay haha no worries whenever we talk about it. And I'm sure you were helpful!,78,15,14:05:04
Erica Yee,But don't think I contributed anything revelatory lol,53,8,14:04:18
Erica Yee,Also a bit weird for me cuz this was the first time talking in a group about dating advice where I was the one dating,117,25,14:04:03
Erica Yee,Or I might type it out on a study break we'll see haha,54,13,14:02:41
Erica Yee,I do want to get your perspective actually but ideally when I can talk in person,80,16,14:01:39
Ben Fickes,I am curious about her situation but maybe that's just me being nosy and it may not be for me to know haha,106,23,13:59:18
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow, sounds like a very interesting lunch haha",49,9,13:58:45
Erica Yee,So very interesting to see how this turns out,45,9,13:57:35
Erica Yee,Anyway this is the girl that is so introverted/antisocial that she forgot the name of her roommate (like who she sleeps in the same room as) when we saw the roommate in public because they literally never talk ðð,218,39,13:57:20
Erica Yee,Pork belly was pretty good but small portion since it was meant to be an appetizer (from the new poke place that replaced temptations on hunt ave),146,27,13:56:43
Erica Yee,Oh dang you are clairvoyant,27,5,13:56:10
Erica Yee,So then I had to talk,21,6,13:55:59
Erica Yee,"Also I just had lunch with Sophie Barbara Kristy Zoe and I promised myself I wouldn't talk much, but then Kristy asked how to know if someone is asking you out because TWO GUYS (basically strangers) have all but asked her out recently",234,43,13:55:54
Ben Fickes,How was the pork belly you snapped,34,7,13:55:35
Ben Fickes,I will haha,11,3,13:55:29
Erica Yee,Kk please let me know what he says xD,37,9,13:54:31
Ben Fickes,I'll message him haha maybe it will come up and I can also see a reaction,73,16,13:53:30
Erica Yee,But I'm good with you messaging him unless you want to see his reaction live,76,15,13:53:01
Erica Yee,Idk why,7,2,13:52:32
Erica Yee,For some reason I'm thinking it would be awkward in person lol,62,12,13:52:29
Ben Fickes,Okay here are my thoughts: if you want to tell him together and/or see his reaction we can when he gets here. If not Iâll message him because it may not come up in person,172,35,13:32:22
Ben Fickes,I can message him or tell him in person and idk which haha,58,13,13:28:13
Ben Fickes,I have not but I was thinking about that haha,45,10,13:27:49
Erica Yee,Did you tell Fab we're dating lol,33,7,11:56:26
Erica Yee,Just occurred to me,19,4,11:56:17
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha,9,2,11:31:17
Erica Yee,Nah she has a midterm on Monday,31,7,11:07:28
Ben Fickes,Also is Sophie going to pax?,28,6,11:05:36
Ben Fickes,No problem :),13,3,11:05:28
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,10:41:23
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Glad you can swallow now and hope you keep feeling better,65,12,10:40:02
Erica Yee,Like it doesn't hurt when I swallow but it still feels sensitive,64,12,10:38:25
Ben Fickes,Is your throat better as in all better or better than before?,61,12,10:37:50
Erica Yee,"Throat is better, voice is still mostly gone. But on the upswing hopefully?",75,13,10:36:52
Erica Yee,Omg realize i need to get better before pax lol,47,10,10:36:22
Erica Yee,Yeah that sounds good,21,4,10:36:09
Ben Fickes,Also how are you feeling today?,31,6,10:26:58
Ben Fickes,If youâre feeling better and donât have too much work do you want to get dinner and/or hang out Friday evening? No pressure though,134,24,10:26:51
Ben Fickes,Oh dang good luck! I think heâs supposed to get in at 9:10 pm. He said heâs deciding between leaving Sunday night and Monday morning,136,25,10:22:21
Erica Yee,My first amendment paper worth 30% of my grade lol is due before 8am class so I may be free depending on when he gets here,122,26,9:49:14
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,9:44:53
Ben Fickes,Fabricio is probably gonna get here Friday night and leave Monday morning,73,12,9:07:16
Ben Fickes,HAHA man now I want both haha,29,7,23:27:08
Erica Yee,she just baked snickerdoodles ð,34,5,23:26:21
Erica Yee,wow good thing you have him instead of sophie this lent,55,11,23:26:10
Ben Fickes,Fwiw Johns bread is very good haha,34,7,23:24:23
Ben Fickes,Yeah I have had similar thoughts before haha,44,8,23:24:08
Erica Yee,"i was going to say i will rant about it to you in person, but actually thinking about it it's probably healthier for me to just not think about it anymore lol",158,32,23:22:25
Ben Fickes,Of course haha I have said way more about my projects haha,58,12,23:20:42
Ben Fickes,No worries! Congrats on being done with it!!!,45,8,23:20:20
Erica Yee,Thanks for listening to all my negative emotion about it,56,10,23:17:20
Erica Yee,Still have to do teammate feedback but yay,42,8,23:16:19
Erica Yee,Just wanted to share that this first research project has been submitted finallyyyyy,84,13,23:15:55
Erica Yee,Lool,4,1,23:15:24
Ben Fickes,If you donât have someone to spray with the water you just canât make anything,82,15,22:06:02
Ben Fickes,No I think thatâs how you do it,33,8,22:05:48
Erica Yee,lol that's probably exactly what's not supposed to happen,57,9,22:05:17
Ben Fickes,Sorry was curious what they had for sous vide gifs haha,55,11,22:03:51
Erica Yee,like i'm not a huge fan of chicken but i will eat so much of it sous vide,73,18,22:02:14
Ben Fickes,I actually remember you mentioning that haha. I donât think Iâve had sous vide food but have heard John rave haha,117,21,22:01:23
Erica Yee,but yikes haha,14,3,22:00:43
Erica Yee,sous vide chicken is sooooo good (my parents like kitchen toys),63,11,22:00:34
Erica Yee,it is sous vide!,16,4,22:00:04
Ben Fickes,He tried to get it to rise by putting it in the sous vide (I think I misspelled that) at 80 degrees. It did not work and he aborted the plan immediately,152,32,21:55:55
Ben Fickes,"Meanwhile here, Thiago got an interview for Thursday and John has bread in the oven",83,15,21:55:25
Ben Fickes,When your voice is back I guess you just gotta scream everything to make up for now,83,17,21:54:54
Ben Fickes,"HAHAHA I can imagine that so clearly, thank you for sharing that haha",69,13,21:54:33
Erica Yee,i feel bad because sophie keeps talking to me and i have to whisper back so she whispers too and then her voice gets progressively louder and then drops back down to a whisper LIOL,180,35,21:54:08
Erica Yee,haha thanks,11,2,21:49:51
Ben Fickes,"Iâll sleep on it (my thoughts, not your report) and tell you I have any tomorrow",82,16,21:39:47
Ben Fickes,I definitely will. Good luck with your report!,46,8,21:39:31
Erica Yee,ok now actually have to finish up this report ðð but lemme know if you have any more thoughts,99,19,21:38:47
Erica Yee,sounds good,11,2,21:38:13
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I guess Iâll just be available and weâll see what happens over time,84,15,21:32:45
Erica Yee,"hmm idk, about accountability. i feel like he does have people (even guys) he knows who he could reach out if he felt like that it. but he's so afraid of people pushing him away i think. also, i really agree with him that he more needs a older adult male figure investing in his life",283,56,21:30:41
Erica Yee,"yeah he does not like talking about his brother omg. his brother went to europe over spring break and victor was criticizing his choice of doing ""touristy things"" so much lmao",175,31,21:27:08
Erica Yee,"honestly i didn't even consciously realize the cycles thing till you said that, probably cuz i'm so used to hearing those things from him it took that new perspective",166,29,21:25:44
Ben Fickes,Okay that was surprisingly short but I think that's it haha,59,11,21:02:47
Ben Fickes,"As for accountability, I haven't really ever actually done accountability (except maybe a little freshmen guys and I guess my parents holding me accountable if that counts), but do you think I should reach out to him about it? Seems almost like he doesn't want it from me and don't wanna push him away. But maybe it'd be good idk",329,60,21:02:20
Ben Fickes,"Sorry about cru, idk what the situation is but sounds not great",63,12,21:01:11
Ben Fickes,Oh unrelated but he mentioned his brother and sounds like they don't get along really,85,15,21:00:33
Ben Fickes,"On diversity, he mentioned high school some. He said he liked high school better than college but he got rejected by his crush senior year and that kinda ruined it for him. He mentioned something about he could have had Asian friends but didn't",244,44,21:00:12
Ben Fickes,"On the cycles thing, that makes a lot of sense, thanks for sharing. I figured he had some sort of thought process I just wasn't attuned to, so thanks for sharing that, it's very helpful",185,35,20:59:21
Ben Fickes,Okay haha thank you again. Random thing before I reply but one thing I forgot is that he said he found girls better at listening and less overbearing than a lot of guys which I think is fair,190,38,20:57:57
Erica Yee,think i'm done for first round haha,35,7,20:56:37
Ben Fickes,"Thank you so much for sharing all of this and listening. Not to interrupt if you're not done though, I'm happy to read any more you have to share",145,29,20:52:33
Erica Yee,that is sad and messed up about his friend :(,45,10,20:51:14
Erica Yee,"when i asked what he learned about you, he said ""I learned I am comfortable talking to guys less because with girls youâre not so often expected to have a friendship/relationship of accountability"" (though he said talking to you wasn't uncomfortable so yay). he has a habit of saying important breakthroughs casually and not realizing his own insight about himself, which i feel like this is",393,66,20:49:51
Erica Yee,"yeah he's mentioned the accountability thing a lot so i've been pushing him to just ask a cru staff (not the northeastern one tho lol) or someone at church but that hasn't happened yet. idk if i told you before but he became christian through cru at boston latin. his family isn't. so something i think about is that a lot of structures that i take for granted as someone who grew up in a stable christian family and regular church, he doesn't even know what that looks like or how to approach it",496,94,20:47:16
Erica Yee,the cru thing is so ugh. there is a looot of drama there that is pretty complicated so i won't get into it but it makes me sad to see (my biased view from victor) in the body of Christ. i don't really get why he doesn't like IV even though i'm pretty sure we've talked about it so eh whoops,290,61,20:43:28
Erica Yee,"an interesting background on victor maybe related to his feelings on diversity at church and guy friends is that at boston latin, even tho i think it has a decent number of asians, he never really had asian friends -- college was the first time. which is hard for me to wrap my mind around because 1) his parents are immigrants i'm pretty sure, 2) boston area has asians. i don't have any revelatory conclusions about this, but things like going to the epic conference were really big steps for him due to his lack of experience with asian community before",556,101,20:41:13
Erica Yee,many time i too do not understand what goes on in that boy's head and what comes out of his mouth. he has told me those words about not feeling like can be single without a crush while wanting to be content without one. i think he feels these things in cycles (the paranoia etc too) which is why he can seem really contradictory,328,64,20:35:13
Erica Yee,ok let's dive in,16,4,20:31:50
Ben Fickes,"""No conclusive evidence""",24,3,20:14:21
Ben Fickes,I did actually haha I got the reference (for once) haha,55,11,20:14:14
Erica Yee,"Not that it was nothing, but yah",32,7,20:14:06
Erica Yee,Lol sorry idk if you saw news about the Mueller report,54,11,20:14:00
Erica Yee,Investigation*,14,1,20:13:51
Erica Yee,We can conduct a 22 month Victor investigate it and find nothing,64,12,20:13:38
Ben Fickes,Maybe we should create a Victor dossier,39,7,20:12:23
Ben Fickes,Take your time haha,19,4,20:11:59
Ben Fickes,No problem! Thank you! I did enjoy the time with him. And he was complaining that none of his friends would be here this summer so I said I would and he said at the end that maybe we can hang out this summer,207,44,20:11:53
Erica Yee,Ok actually think I need computer too so give me a bit,54,12,20:11:49
Erica Yee,Lemme read thru,15,3,20:10:54
Erica Yee,"HAHA jk thank you so much, really appreciate you hanging with him and giving me the deets ð",94,18,20:10:41
Erica Yee,Whaaa that's it?,16,3,20:09:48
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening to this massive Victor info dump,53,9,20:09:43
Ben Fickes,I'll add if I have any more,27,7,20:09:29
Ben Fickes,Think that's it,15,3,20:09:22
Ben Fickes,"Last thing I think is not really related to Victor but he mentioned his ""best friend"" was ""going through a lot"" because she had to pretend to enjoy apartment hunting with her boyfriend whom she lives with even though she is ""planning to break up with him when she goes to Vietnam this summer."" And he kept talking about how it was tough for her. And I know that's a complicated situation and I did not say anything but really wanted to vent that I don't think that's right to pretend to like someone so yeah thanks for listening haha",533,100,20:09:19
Ben Fickes,"At some point he mentioned accountability. And he said ""guy friendships slowly blossom into relationships where you keep each other accountable. And I don't want that."" I was really confused and asked more he said he had never had someone to keep him accountable (he mentioned that in connection with Europe). I asked if he wanted someone to keep him accountable and he said ""it depends if God wills it."" I asked if he had a want for one way or another though and he said not really, whatever God wants",502,91,20:06:46
Ben Fickes,He also said his only guy friend was someone from Harvard he sees once a month. And he said he wishes he had been discipled by someone I think,142,29,20:04:51
Ben Fickes,"So one of the things he said toward the beginning was ""I went to IV a couple times. But one of the reasons I stopped going was the ratio of guys to girls. I find it easier to connect with girls than guys."" So I was kinda confused (did he not go because he wanted a higher girl:guy ratio)? So I asked him if the ratio was something he looked for in a group and I don't remember his exact response but I don't think it was a clear yes or no. He said later ""if I were sitting here with two guys who were white, I would probably not talk. If they were Asian, I would feel threatened."" And at some point he mentioned feeling threatened by guys again and he said immediately after it ""even meeting with you... was a stretch."" (Does he feel threatened by me???) So I tried to ask him what he meant by threatened and he said ""It just makes me think of what life could have been like if I had been in other activities besides Cru."" Then he said not to get to hung up on the word ""threatened."" I asked him more about it and he mentioned particularly being in IV instead of Cru (then he said the stuff about IV being cliquey, if I remember correctly). He mentioned he told 5 or 6 girls about his crush in the very beginning",1212,241,20:04:02
Ben Fickes,Then we talked about guy friends vs. girl friends,49,9,19:55:57
Ben Fickes,Talked about his work some which was good and interesting,57,10,19:55:42
Ben Fickes,"He talked a little bit about feeling disconnected from Cru. He talked about going to Europe (which he talked about his unsafe behaviors there, lack of caring whether he came back) and then how he felt that ""some people in Cru probably wish I didn't come back."" I told him I didn't think that was true and he shrugged and said he did think it was true of some people. Sometime around then he talked about his paranoia about things. I talked very briefly about my dad and Josh's struggle to believe his friends loved him. Will talk about this more briefly later but IV came up and he said ""IV is cliquey, which is fine"" and toward the end he said ""I am going to make negative effort to get to know people from IV""",711,136,19:55:26
Ben Fickes,"He said he goes to his current church out of convenience because it's nearby to his work. He said twice that church feels very white to him. He mentioned he felt disconnected from church and I asked if it was his church specifically or church in general. He said more of the latter but did not elaborate. He mentioned considering visiting BCEC if he left his current church. I said ""I know some people who go, if you end up visiting let me know."" But he immediately rejected that and said ""if I go I'm just going to be a shadow on the back pew."" He mentioned that he felt he was very slowly gaining community at his current church. But he said he had individual friendships, not a group of friends",697,132,19:51:39
Ben Fickes,"He also mentioned later in talking about church ""getting rejected by my crush would be a perfect reason to stop going to my church."" So I will transition to church stuff now",173,32,19:46:18
Ben Fickes,"I think he talked about having a crush and stuff but maybe I brought it up, I can't remember. But I know at one point I said ""Erica told me you're going through something with a girl"" (I think that was as much info as I said I had) and he immediately said something like ""I've made it a point never to talk with guys about girls."" Then he said something that made it sound like he talked it over with a guy friend and got good advice?? Maybe I misheard some stuff but I was kinda confused. Anyways I kept asking him more about it and he answered so oh well haha. He said he was lacking motivation and I asked him about it and he said that stemmed from lack of optimism about her saying yes. He said she doesn't have FB so he only sees her in person and doesn't message her. I asked him about getting to know her as a friend and he said (at separate points)  something like ""you shouldn't do that if you like someone"" (which I can see some logic to) and ""I don't have the patience for that"" (which honestly seems like a red flag to me). Then at some point he said ""I've never felt like I could be single and not have a crush"" (which seems like an important revelation to me even though he said it casually). I asked him if he wanted to be able to be single without a crush and he said ""right now I can't imagine that."" We didn't get any further in that regard",1358,271,19:45:36
Ben Fickes,So first on kimchimberly (who we did not talk about that much actually),71,13,19:36:45
Ben Fickes,Okay transitioning to computer to type out debrief haha,55,9,19:32:24
Ben Fickes,Okay so before my real debrief on this topic yes he would just not talk and like stare off to space and said so much random stuff haha. But honestly it made me feel more comfortable because I didnât feel pressure at always having to talk. And he was actually less awkward than I expected haha,294,56,19:32:09
Erica Yee,Oh for sure. He is so awkward sometimes it pains me around other people,71,14,19:28:19
Ben Fickes,awkward not awakened haha oops,30,5,19:27:54
Ben Fickes,Iâll type it out gimme just a sec. And HAHA oh my goodness sorry that is valid but only between you and me he definitely is more awakened than I haha,151,31,19:27:43
Erica Yee,"He says you're ""slightly awkward"" LMAO",38,6,19:26:54
Erica Yee,I can also wait but idk when I'll see you,41,10,19:26:39
Erica Yee,No I'm kinda dying of curiosity so would love to hear. Up to you if you want to type it out,91,21,19:26:18
Ben Fickes,I would normally want to talk to you about it in person sometime but since you have no voice do you want me to message you about it? I know you have the project due at midnight so no worries if you canât now,209,44,19:23:35
Ben Fickes,Thanks! I just got back from meeting with him. It was very interesting. He shared a lot which was good. Not gonna lie some of the things he said were kinda troubling and some made no sense to me,194,39,19:22:32
Erica Yee,Excited and praying ð,24,4,17:52:27
Ben Fickes,Iâm like a minute away,24,5,17:50:19
Ben Fickes,HAHA letâs hope so,20,4,17:50:15
Erica Yee,But I'm guessing he remembers what you look like :P,51,10,17:39:18
Erica Yee,Victor just asked me your major and year lmao,45,9,17:39:07
Erica Yee,Will do ð,12,3,17:38:08
Ben Fickes,Just tell me what results you want ;) haha jk,45,10,16:50:41
Ben Fickes,Okay haha I can definitely do that!,35,7,16:50:32
Erica Yee,I really don't want to do one but we're probably going to,57,12,16:50:15
Erica Yee,You can probably take our survey actually lol,45,8,16:50:03
Ben Fickes,I know there isn't but if I can ever help in any way please let me know,71,17,16:49:35
Ben Fickes,I'm so sorry Erica,18,4,16:49:23
Erica Yee,No then we have to run an actual experiment somehow for the third one haha,74,15,16:49:08
Ben Fickes,Do you get a break after that or not,36,9,16:46:19
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I'm so sorry,27,6,16:46:07
Erica Yee,We already have to start our next research study project (with a different group) and it's due next Wednesday ughh I hate this,126,23,16:45:23
Erica Yee,And aww hope it's alright,25,5,16:44:42
Erica Yee,Whoa that's so cool,19,4,16:44:22
Ben Fickes,BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM MY FIRST GROUP IS IN MY GROUP NOW ugh not really a huge deal in reality but still haha,113,25,16:40:30
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. My class ended very early so Iâm already back haha. And sorta, he said we needed to add on more so weâre gonna make a visual novel engine which Iâm actually super hype for",185,35,16:40:02
Erica Yee,Did you get your final project approved?,40,7,16:36:12
Erica Yee,Yay good job!,13,3,16:36:05
Erica Yee,Neither but staying on campus,29,5,16:36:01
Ben Fickes,Also are you walking back or working with your group after your class?,70,13,16:08:34
Ben Fickes,No problem :) also just submitted systems,41,7,15:47:01
Erica Yee,ok cool thanks :P,17,4,14:48:49
Ben Fickes,Iâm happy to listen I just donât usually know what to say but Iâm okay listening haha,91,17,14:46:54
Ben Fickes,For you not me haha,19,5,14:46:36
Ben Fickes,No itâs good itâs a part of life,36,8,14:46:32
Erica Yee,"Thanks I appreciate xD sorry if tmi, I can not talk about it",60,13,14:37:48
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah my bad haha. And gotcha hope it goes well? Donât know what to say exactly but Iâm trying to express support haha,124,24,14:36:05
Erica Yee,Also I just started my period so that's fun. At least it was pretty much on time,80,17,14:34:08
Erica Yee,Not with class in 20 mins haha,30,7,14:33:42
Ben Fickes,Have you suggested that they work to get it done sooner haha,60,12,14:23:45
Ben Fickes,Oh no Iâm so sorry,20,5,14:23:29
Erica Yee,So now my group has no motivation to finish it right now even though I don't want to think about it as soon as possible,119,25,14:21:37
Erica Yee,Also my research Prof just posted the blackboard assignment for the group report and it's due at midnight not at class time omg,127,23,14:20:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah my thoughts exactly,24,4,14:18:52
Erica Yee,And oh man yikes,16,4,14:18:39
Erica Yee,Wait that's so funny lol,24,5,14:18:29
Ben Fickes,Oh one kid literally just took a zero today rather than presenting,66,12,14:17:50
Ben Fickes,But honestly Iâm not worried this class is pretty chill and Iâve gotten good grades so far,94,17,14:17:32
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I talked about myself writing so Iâll be writing about myself talking about myself writing,102,17,14:17:04
Erica Yee,writing about yourself talking about yourself maybe worse than just writing about yourself,90,13,14:15:17
Erica Yee,omg dang,8,2,14:14:51
Ben Fickes,Now I have to write a thousand word evaluation of my five minute presentation haha,82,15,14:11:05

Erica Yee,if you have time to talk about it,33,8,14:07:09

Erica Yee,aww no,6,2,14:04:37
Ben Fickes,"Sorry you donât have to reply but wanted to vent, restarting to see if that helps",83,16,14:04:15
Ben Fickes,Ugh I changed nothing with systems and now it doesnât work,60,11,14:03:57
Erica Yee,Loool got it,12,3,13:53:28

Ben Fickes,Oh man. I hope you feel better. But yeah good think you donât have to present and thereâs no ST,99,20,9:26:02

Ben Fickes,How are you doing this morning?,31,6,9:04:38
Ben Fickes,Gotcha haha. Hope you get some rest then (and hope someone else does the discussion haha),89,16,0:45:06

Ben Fickes,I'll just adopt 5 kids and start training to break the record,61,12,20:34:44
Ben Fickes,HAHA dang that's awesome. Can't imagine doing that haha,55,9,20:34:18
Erica Yee,My mom's coworker running her first full marathon took pic of dad pushing stroller with 5 kids who apparently broke a world record by finishing under 5 hours with them. And apparently had to keep stopping to feed them lmao,222,40,20:33:36

Ben Fickes,My reward for myself for not falling asleep in church,53,10,13:25:54
Ben Fickes,And sorry for the late reply I took a nap haha,46,11,13:25:31
Ben Fickes,"Sorry I was napping haha. It was Your Great Name (at least thatâs what I think itâs called, itâs the one where the chorus is âJeeeeeesus, worthy is the lamb that was slaaaain for usâ). No personal significance it just really hit me haha",246,44,13:25:20
Erica Yee,Aww what song was it?,21,5,12:42:01
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,12:41:56
Ben Fickes,Also was really not feeling the songs in the beginning but at the last song at the end I started crying so I guess it evens out haha,132,28,12:35:40
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. And church was good! Felt very tired and fittingly the sermon was on the verses about the disciples falling asleep while Jesus prays haha. Actually have a lot of thoughts on what the pastor (sermon was about temptation) said but one thing she said that stuck out to me was âJudas was the money keeper which meant people thought he was worthy of  trust.â,368,66,12:34:57
Erica Yee,Also I was able to talk somewhat which was good haha,52,11,12:30:49
Erica Yee,How was church?,15,3,12:30:32
Erica Yee,"Just showed her behrakis, curry, isec basically",47,7,12:30:29

Erica Yee,Ran into Patrick h and his brother on the way to brunch. Well actually they were on a run and I heard fast footsteps behind me so I tried to dodge but then realized it was them lol,180,38,12:27:33
Ben Fickes,:),2,1,10:19:00
Erica Yee,"It's ok, it was worth x)",24,6,9:07:32

Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,19:22:38
Ben Fickes,We spent two hours on something that was swapped arguments,58,10,19:08:53

Erica Yee,And thanks for everything :),28,5,23:17:43
Erica Yee,(from experience lol),21,3,23:17:33
Erica Yee,"Kk heads up it might be fast food, Dorchester, or asking if you want to cook",76,16,23:17:29
Erica Yee,Guess who was texting while walking and went all the way down to Snell basement lmao,84,16,23:16:46
Ben Fickes,I donât wanna ask him where he wants to eat yet because he might think weâre talking about him but please remind me in the morning,134,26,23:14:48
Ben Fickes,I definitely will. Iâm so sorry. And Iâll talk to him on Monday if that still goes through,94,18,23:13:52
Erica Yee,"Agh he agreed with the reasoning we discussed, but now I think he's going into the possible depression/paranoia that led him to hitchhike around Europe and almost not come back...please pray",190,31,23:07:25
Erica Yee,Ah nice,7,2,22:54:22
Ben Fickes,It is! The rest of them are playing overcooked haha. And Iâm glad! Hope you get some good rest,96,19,22:48:48

Erica Yee,Hope you're having fun with your friends,40,7,22:47:25
Ben Fickes,Also high quality meme haha,27,5,22:47:13
Ben Fickes,No worries haha are you okay? And happy to help :),50,11,22:47:05
Erica Yee,"But this is very helpful, thank you :)",38,8,22:46:57
Erica Yee,Thank you!! Could not think clearly about emotions etc right now so I sent him this meme to stall,97,19,22:46:20
Erica Yee,Ok this is very good,20,5,22:45:52
Ben Fickes,"Okay and most likely scenario is:
V: âI like someoneâ
K: âoh who is itâ
V: âI canât sayâ

And I think that will leave no question in her mind itâs her",166,32,22:45:07
Ben Fickes,"If he tells her he has a crush on someone and not on whom, there are two cases. The first is that she thinks (correctly) itâs on her (might be likely depending how well she can read him and how close they are). Then heâs essentially told her but not directly so it doesnât give her a chance to actually respond (which isnât fair to her). The other case is that she doesnât know itâs her and she will definitively not think of him in any romantic terms because she will think he is interested in someone else",519,98,22:44:12
Erica Yee,Oh sorry didn't realize they were still there. This is not super urgent,71,13,22:42:39
Ben Fickes,Okay so my thoughts:,20,4,22:40:41
Ben Fickes,Now there is at least one good thing to come from all of this haha,66,15,22:40:36
Ben Fickes,No worries haha. HAHA I started laughing in the midst of all my guests thatâs hilarious,89,16,22:40:24
Erica Yee,I'm laughing my head off in Snell after he sent me this gif,59,13,22:39:54
Erica Yee,I'm dying,9,2,22:39:37
Erica Yee,Sorry for the code LOL,22,5,22:39:13
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,22:39:10
Ben Fickes,"Okay so to be clear, he wants to say vaguely that he has a crush (but not on whom), and you want to tell him not to do that",123,29,22:38:47
Erica Yee,Or please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks it's a bad idea lol,69,16,22:37:14
Erica Yee,How do I tell v to not tell k that he has a c but not say it's on her??,71,20,22:36:56
Erica Yee,You too haha,12,3,18:48:07
Ben Fickes,No problem! Hope your evening is good :),40,8,18:47:47

Ben Fickes,So what do you have left?,25,6,18:19:55
Ben Fickes,Thatâs amazing Erica! Congrats :),35,5,18:19:33

Ben Fickes,My thought exactly haha,23,4,17:43:16
Erica Yee,lol what ok xD,14,4,17:43:03
Ben Fickes,"His explanation: May is short for mayonnaise, because it tastes good. Sona is short for Furrsona, which is a Furry's persona. I still have no idea why he gave those names but that was his explanation",199,36,17:41:47
Ben Fickes,"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you feel better soon. Sona and May, both created by John",90,19,17:40:56
Erica Yee,ooh what are they,17,4,17:40:17

Erica Yee,"on the w-2 from co-op, the employer address for parent company nbc is new york and there is no state name next to state wages/withholding. so initially i filled out new york, but it said i actually owed money. so then i deleted that one and filled out new jersey....which apparently owes me money! so filed that one (MA, CA, NJ) and hopefully it's fine and i get my tax return ð¬ð¬",385,72,17:16:41

Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs good. Yeah sorry you have so much. If you donât have time to hangout this weekend but wanna work together Iâm okay with that,140,26,9:57:02
Erica Yee,Honestly not feeling really stressed though. More just like ugh so much work,76,13,9:45:17

Erica Yee,Oh well think I got the bonuses so it's fine,44,10,9:32:41

Ben Fickes,Oh good luck! Was the project due for this class or a different one?,68,14,9:10:40
Erica Yee,"And thanks, about to take a quiz but I think it's multiple choice so shouldn't be too bad",89,18,9:06:31
Erica Yee,That's what I get for reading news from it right before bed haha,64,13,9:06:11
Ben Fickes,Hope your class is going well!,30,6,9:05:11
Ben Fickes,HAHA thatâs hilarious! Iâm gonna tell Josh about that,57,9,9:04:40
Erica Yee,I dreamt we and Josh were at gdc but I don't know what it looked like so in my dream it was just a blurry pax lol,113,27,7:38:46
Ben Fickes,Sounds good! Feel like Iâm gonna show up tomorrow but have to remind myself itâs Saturday haha,98,17,22:26:10

Erica Yee,Oh yes our date at the foodbank,31,7,22:16:59
Ben Fickes,Thanks :) yeah would love to hang sometime this weekend if youâre doing okay on work but no pressure if youâre not. If thereâs anything on your mind or you really need a break or anything I probably have an hour or two but if not Iâll see you Sat morning,262,51,22:16:01
Erica Yee,Hope you guys have fun :),25,6,22:08:43
Erica Yee,But I should actually get as much done as possible since weekend is kinda busy,78,15,22:08:35
Erica Yee,Cuz I was gonna ask if you want to hang if I finish enough work,63,15,22:08:13
Erica Yee,No worries! Honestly probably better,36,5,22:07:43
Ben Fickes,And haha ð maybe you just suddenly love cannolis,51,9,22:05:21
Ben Fickes,"In the evening I made plans to have Matt, Beth, Rachel, and Brian over, sorry ð but would be down to do something later in the week if you want! Or you could probably come too tomorrow if you really want to",209,42,22:05:05
Erica Yee,Omg why do I keep defending cannolis this is a social construct I'm conforming to the world,91,17,22:00:40
Erica Yee,What are you doing tomorrow?,28,5,21:48:32
Erica Yee,What makes you say that xD,26,6,20:33:38
Ben Fickes,Okay from your description I think I like them more than you do haha,68,14,20:31:13
Erica Yee,Well apparently I can't either xD,33,6,20:30:18
Ben Fickes,"Oh I love ricotta filling haha. I like cannolis a lot, wouldn't say I ever have cravings for them or anything but I would definitely not turn them down haha",156,30,20:28:53
Erica Yee,Do you like them?,17,4,20:27:49
Erica Yee,Yes and not a huge fan of the ricotta filling,45,10,20:27:45
Ben Fickes,The mess?,9,2,20:26:34
Ben Fickes,Why did you decide you didn't like them haha,44,9,20:26:32
Erica Yee,Oh well still ok,16,4,20:26:16
Erica Yee,Ok now that I'm eating it I remember why I decided I don't like them that much,78,17,20:26:09
Erica Yee,Lol they just apologized for getting them from modern pastry instead of Mike's,78,13,20:25:46
Ben Fickes,Ugh itâs probably gonna be saved until the end because they know people will leave if they serve it,101,19,20:22:55
Erica Yee,I was told there would be from Mike's pastry (plus the dinner) but I don't see it yet ð¤ð¤,94,19,20:22:25
Erica Yee,I like the cream,16,4,20:21:52

Erica Yee,Also everyone else is dressed up whoops,39,7,19:55:22
Erica Yee,Futures in the sciences. Nu sci helped organize but I didn't know about it till someone texted in the slack right before. It's all these scientists talking to science students about science things so I don't understand anything but it's fine lol,245,42,19:55:05

Ben Fickes,Canât make the vigil at 3 because of volunteering,51,9,9:44:37
Ben Fickes,Iâm good haha. Honestly maybe it was momentary but I still feel hopeful from my convo with John. Work is starting to get heavier but I think itâs gonna be alright. Have to do a prototype today for my game for games and social justice and then will try to start on the project for game engines (or at least figure out a group),329,64,9:44:23

Ben Fickes,Apart from ports how do you like the laptop?,44,9,13:52:43

Ben Fickes,"Oh wow! Iâm glad too. And gotcha, looking forward to hearing about it!",72,13,11:38:38
Erica Yee,"I listened to the enneagram marriage episode and then another one from a different podcast explaining all the types and don't have that many thoughts honestly, at least that I can articulate yet. But it was interesting and there's a few things I can share whenever we have this conversation haha",295,51,11:36:27
Erica Yee,I'm very glad though,20,4,11:34:52
Erica Yee,I did not! And he didn't mention it to me so I won't bring it up,64,16,11:34:48
Ben Fickes,Idk if you had a hand in this but Victor and I are meeting for dinner on Monday,79,18,11:26:39
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,10:58:24
Ben Fickes,laurafickes@yahoo.com haha,26,2,9:56:54
Erica Yee,What's your mom's email? My mom wants to know,45,9,8:05:09
Ben Fickes,It was very short lived,23,5,22:22:39
Erica Yee,Yeah she was the one who told me about his journalism minor ð¤£,64,13,22:19:05
Erica Yee,LMAO,4,1,22:18:45
Ben Fickes,He was talking about people he was close with freshman year and he said âand I talked to Erica about a lot of stuff going on in my life.â He meant Amy haha,159,33,22:16:07
Ben Fickes,Oh I have a slightly funny story from eating with Jason earlier,63,12,22:14:54
Erica Yee,Haha thanks,11,2,22:13:22
Ben Fickes,Oh wow! North Carolina? Iâve been there for running. Hope you enjoy your time with them if that happens!,106,19,22:12:20
Erica Yee,Actually that time my mom just texted she's gonna try to visit other new relatives in Raleigh? And wants me to go too. So we'll see if that happens,147,29,22:05:01
Erica Yee,I wish,6,2,22:04:28
Ben Fickes,Hmmm I think maybe you should come to Boston to see it ð haha,64,14,21:49:20
Erica Yee,Oh well,7,2,21:47:39
Erica Yee,Fab just told me they announced its May 15 LOL rip,50,11,21:47:37

Erica Yee,Gillette,8,1,21:24:47
Erica Yee,Do you remember fab and I were really excited cuz my soccer team (Chelsea) announced a game against the new England revolution here at gillete?,143,25,21:24:41
Erica Yee,Yeah we'll see,14,3,21:10:04
Ben Fickes,Oh wow. Well I hope it goes well for her then. Hopefully she makes new friends to make up for her boss being bad?,113,24,21:06:16
Erica Yee,"If she gets offered it (and they would be dumb to not, she has clearly shown herself capable and already knows the ropes), I think she is going to take it",154,31,21:04:26
Erica Yee,"Pretty bad lol. And her coworker friend she really liked is the person whose position she would be taking cuz they just got a new job at HBO, which means she would kinda be alone against her boss",195,38,21:03:46
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. How bad is the boss? And is she leaning one way or the other?,70,16,20:58:10
Erica Yee,Talked a lot with Jasmine about a job she might get offered at CNBC on the team she co-oped at that would be an amazing position but it's a really hard choice cuz the boss is so bad,181,38,20:55:04
Erica Yee,Haha omg,8,2,20:53:00
Ben Fickes,Maybe there's a secret bathroom they're keeping from you,56,9,20:43:21
Erica Yee,But there's never anyone else,29,5,20:42:38
Erica Yee,I don't understand how none of the other girls don't go to the bathroom during break OR after class ?! I do both,112,23,20:42:30
Erica Yee,"It was ok, SQL so kinda boring",30,7,20:41:57
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,20:41:40
Ben Fickes,How was class?,14,3,20:41:27
Ben Fickes,You were one of three people she specifically mentioned in talking about her first experience with worship I think,114,19,20:41:22
Erica Yee,I honestly have no idea for what,32,7,20:40:31
Erica Yee,Lol what,8,2,20:40:23
Ben Fickes,Erin name dropped you in her talk haha,38,8,19:15:48
Erica Yee,Haha yay,8,2,17:19:38
Ben Fickes,And I did too ofc haha,22,6,15:56:22
Ben Fickes,HAHA I'm glad it arrived. My mom really really appreciated your family hosting us,81,14,15:56:18
Erica Yee,Your mom's thank you note arrived. I'm guessing it had a stamp ð,67,13,15:54:14
Ben Fickes,HAHA oh my goodness that's hilarious. Glad he got out,53,10,13:49:53
Erica Yee,He did get out of it though,27,7,13:47:04
Erica Yee,Calvin emailed our home county to try to get out of jury duty and the response is so funny,90,19,13:46:40
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,13:46:15
Ben Fickes,Don't know his last name,24,5,13:44:41
Ben Fickes,Yeah pretty sure his name's Alex,32,6,13:44:35
Erica Yee,Oh nice! Did you know his name?,31,7,13:44:05
Ben Fickes,"Very random but a kid from my games and social justice class class came up to me after class and said âyouâre Ben, right?â Then he asked if I was a developer and I thought he was gonna try to get me to work on a project but he actually just talked to me about classes and games and stuff and it was very nice and unexpected haha",334,68,13:34:45
Erica Yee,Of course,9,2,11:36:00
Ben Fickes,Thank you Erica :),18,4,11:32:26
Erica Yee,Ah got it. Glad he was willing to talk to you and will pray,59,14,11:29:52
Ben Fickes,Also Iâll tell you about this in person sometime but I talked to John some last night since we all went to bed at the same time after the movie. And a part of me was wondering why he deactivated his Facebook. And he talked about that and how heâs doing and Iâm not worried for his immediate safety but I am worried in the sense that it seems like heâs doing worse,371,73,11:23:06
Ben Fickes,Well if itâs much needed itâs not procrastinating haha,58,9,11:21:21
Ben Fickes,Sorry meant to send that earlier,32,6,11:21:03
Ben Fickes,Ugh I know. And losing your eyes ugh thatâs pretty creepy. Glad you got some stuff done this morning!,103,19,11:20:56
Erica Yee,Lol this might be procrastinating work I don't want to do but now doing laundry and much needed cleaning,104,19,11:20:32
Erica Yee,And then went to the gym,24,6,10:50:29
Erica Yee,"I'm good, woke up late but managed to speed walk to class in 11 instead of 15 mins (you have to pick up nameplates at the beginning of class for attendance)",156,31,10:50:16
Erica Yee,The mom ð¶ð¶,16,3,10:49:19
Ben Fickes,How are you doing today?,24,5,10:24:10
Ben Fickes,Slept late so no time to run now but oh well,44,11,10:24:04
Ben Fickes,I think John had but Thiago hadnât. Also I think I had only seen parts of it not all of it. Less creepy than a horror movie but way creepier than a kids movie should be haha,175,37,10:23:49
Erica Yee,Had they seen the movie before?,31,6,7:56:25
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:40:15
Ben Fickes,Wow he wouldnât be Joshs brother. And I can understand that haha,66,12,22:37:04
Erica Yee,(^ actually was a bit of an issue cuz his side wanted him to shave it),70,16,22:36:43
Erica Yee,That facial hair omg,20,4,22:36:14
Erica Yee,Would you vote to confirm him,29,6,22:36:10
Ben Fickes,"Robert Bork is a great name. That just made my mind, Iâm going to switch to a history major. Guess weâre gonna have our first argument, sorry Erica",151,28,22:32:42
Erica Yee,And lol nooo ð ,17,4,22:27:18
Erica Yee,It's on Reagan's failed supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork,63,10,22:26:53
Ben Fickes,Oh wow congrats to him!!! Whatâs it about? Unless you donât feel like presenting right now haha. And wow Erica I was about to message you that Iâm heavily considering switching majors to history but now I feel conflicted,226,39,22:22:04
Erica Yee,Also very glad that you're not a history major because I don't think I could survive two close people like this honestly. Don't get me started on Victor and art history lmao..,175,32,22:20:43
Erica Yee,So I feel like this due date is an accomplishment in my life too xD,67,15,22:19:13
Erica Yee,It's interesting but I feel like I've heard enough about it to do the presentation myself lol,93,17,22:18:49
Erica Yee,And today is finally the due date omg,37,8,22:18:14
Erica Yee,"Random but Calvin has been working on his senior thesis for the past two quarters (so since last fall) and I've basically been hearing about every single step of writing this 13,000 history/poli sci paper",204,35,22:18:03
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,22:14:06
Erica Yee,Jk sorry I definitely will,26,5,22:12:17
Erica Yee,That he'll be able to read?,27,6,22:12:10
Ben Fickes,Oh also he was vague with me so I donât even know specifics but if you could pray for Michael I think that would be good,122,26,22:10:45
Ben Fickes,Sounds like a plan ð,23,5,22:10:10
Erica Yee,Agh ok let's prioritize it to the next time together,52,10,22:09:23
Erica Yee,2. LOL OH YEAH,14,4,22:08:59
Erica Yee,1. Definitely ok that you didn't feel like talking about it last night but yah we will talk about,97,19,22:08:55
Ben Fickes,Oh also two more things: 1. I still have enneagram related thoughts (shouldâve probably talked about them last night but didnât feel like it haha sorry) 2. Whenever we do eventually get time together do you want to do another chapter bible study?,250,43,22:00:58
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð okay sure thing! I actually have some thoughts to talk to you about about it too,90,18,21:58:55
Erica Yee,"As in I want to talk about next year, not talk next year ð",61,14,21:54:56
Erica Yee,As in I don't have anything to talk about but I should lol,58,13,21:54:18
Erica Yee,As in next year,15,4,21:54:02

Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:02:33
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:02:23
Ben Fickes,Yeah I guess time is time so it's just restructuring it not losing it,69,14,16:12:45
Erica Yee,At least I'm bring productive for other classes haha,52,9,16:04:46
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,16:04:33

Erica Yee,Aw sorry didn't see this till I got to class but yep al,55,13,11:39:39

Erica Yee,Hm probably both,16,3,10:54:43
Erica Yee,I call you Jesus,16,4,10:54:11
Ben Fickes,Okay haha let me know how it is! If you think itâs worth listening to maybe I will. And oh glad you got more time! What song? And okeydokey! Do you mean youâre going between classes and also between second class and ST or just the latter?,242,47,10:40:55
Erica Yee,"Also also now that I think about it I'll likely go to Snell between afternoon class and ST, so see you there",108,22,10:17:16
Erica Yee,Also there's no rehearsal for aletheia downtown  again lmao so yay for more time but don't know one of the songs so might have to go to Ryder and practice,154,30,10:17:08

Ben Fickes,Okay nvm he says he doesnât want to talk now,46,10,16:58:27
Ben Fickes,"Like should I keep it âif you ever wanna talk about anything let me knowâ or âI heard you had something today, how are you feeling?â",140,26,16:55:20
Ben Fickes,"Okay also Victor is messaging me, how much do you want me to say I know about the situation?",92,19,16:54:53

Erica Yee,No weren't individual ones both colors? Like penguins,53,8,13:06:30
Erica Yee,I was very not until the sermon so I was thinking about the ending scene again (actually teared up a little LOL must look very spiritual),137,26,13:06:13
Ben Fickes,Like the two kids that were male were black and the one that was female was white?,82,17,13:06:06
Ben Fickes,Uh because some of their kids are male and others are female,60,12,13:05:49
Erica Yee,Do the different gender phenotypes only express when they're older??,68,10,13:05:43
Erica Yee,Ok if male night furies are black and female are white then why are their kids both colors,90,18,13:05:14
Erica Yee,Oh I'm glad!,12,3,13:04:45

Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm trying downloading new software but am gonna head over to Snell in the meantime in case it doesnât work. And because it would be nice to see you haha,162,31,21:41:21

Erica Yee,Can anybody in your group do it?,32,7,21:32:59
Erica Yee,Hm don't think you did but oh no :(,35,9,21:32:42
Ben Fickes,So Iâm restarting my computer in case that fixes it but sadly this might be a little close,92,18,21:27:15
Ben Fickes,So idk if I told you about trying to start a personal project in NY. But I had to download graphics software for it and t didnât work. But apparently because of that software my screen capture recording software doesnât work,228,41,21:26:45
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good! Iâll be up by then haha,43,9,20:51:23
Erica Yee,"Oh we're supposed to be there at 945 actually, so meet at 930?",62,13,20:50:19
Erica Yee,Yeah sure!,10,2,20:40:49

Erica Yee,"Oh please also remind me to tell you two things from her (r&r, club)",68,14,20:30:48
Erica Yee,Also Abby k really needed to talk about her life so I'm glad I was able to be there to listen. I feel like the only times we talk are deep stuff lol,148,33,20:30:07
Erica Yee,"Sam Thomas, Abby m, Dara, Molly, other friends were there but thankfully didn't have any more chairs at their table so it was ok for us to just stand and not order anything and then leave ð",192,37,20:28:42
Erica Yee,Too loud and crowded for us to want to stay longer but we finally fulfilled our friendship target of going to one of Patrick's gigs,131,25,20:27:57
Erica Yee,Abby and I are perfect for one another omg. Band was playing 5-8. Got there at 740. Heard a few songs and congratulated our friends. Left at 8,142,28,20:27:13

Erica Yee,But I have something to tell you from it about mentoring,56,11,19:20:17
Erica Yee,Omg the panel was so long,25,6,19:19:49

Erica Yee,"Omg one of the speakers just ran in and introduced herself as ""this is [name]"" what",83,16,17:00:45
Ben Fickes,Hope the event is a success but you got pizza and thatâs whatâs important haha,82,15,17:00:37
Ben Fickes,Yeah finished early for psych. Game is pretty set! Itâs non coding stuff from here on out (though I might add a feature if thereâs time),140,26,17:00:11
Erica Yee,I hope people show up to this event though.. but since I'm doing marketing writing not journalism I guess i can say it was a huge success anyway ð¤·,149,29,16:58:00
Erica Yee,You're done with classes?,25,4,16:56:31
Erica Yee,Omgg,4,1,16:56:27
Ben Fickes,I ate breakfast at 11 so I wasnât hungry for lunch at 11:15 and now Iâm starving so Iâm treating myself qdoba haha,120,23,16:55:29
Ben Fickes,Best reason to be awkwardly early haha,38,7,16:55:00
Erica Yee,So gonna crack open the pizza lol,33,7,16:54:46
Erica Yee,Awkwardly early to this event and they said I could take food,61,12,16:54:31
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,16:54:20
Ben Fickes,r and r is ryder 143,20,6,16:44:47
Ben Fickes,I will for sure,15,4,16:05:22
Erica Yee,Haha no worries but lemme know if you find out,46,10,16:04:37
Erica Yee,Ohhh apparently he texted her first saying he heard she got an offer from them,78,15,16:04:28
Ben Fickes,I probably won't see him until Tuesday,38,7,16:03:09
Ben Fickes,Okay haha if I see him I'll ask him,35,9,16:02:59
Ben Fickes,Probably good advice haha,25,4,15:30:33
Erica Yee,"Ah ok thanks, I'll tell her to just ask him lol",47,11,15:30:19
Ben Fickes,I feel like it wasn't cbiz but idk,34,8,15:29:25
Ben Fickes,Oh idk. He got an offer but I don't know from where,51,12,15:29:13
Erica Yee,Barbara is asking lol,21,4,15:28:28
Erica Yee,Do you know if Dan got an offer from cbiz?,42,10,15:28:18
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha,11,2,15:18:02
Erica Yee,Hope you guys figure it out!,28,6,15:13:41
Erica Yee,That's either a super easy or super hard game,45,9,15:13:24
Ben Fickes,We have the same code but mine displays a red rectangle and no tiles which is just wacky,88,18,15:09:55
Ben Fickes,So game engines looks like it might be a little tighter than originally thought but I think it'll be okay,105,20,15:09:33
Erica Yee,Yep I hope they're reclining seats as I've heard haha,53,10,15:02:49
Ben Fickes,Yeah at least you get it done now! Sorry it's so inconvenient to get to fenway but we have saved seats so not like we'll lose them,130,27,14:55:26
Erica Yee,I'll meet you at the theater i think. Very complicated getting to fenway from there but will figure it out,106,20,14:42:24
Erica Yee,Ugh but we really need to go lol,32,8,14:41:52
Erica Yee,Ok definitely going to the seaport tomorrow,43,7,14:41:39
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,13:59:19

Erica Yee,Do you mind telling me what room r&r is in when you find out please?,68,15,13:57:52
Erica Yee,No worries lol that is weird to think about,43,9,13:52:47
Ben Fickes,Sorry not to make your story about me just interesting to think about haha,74,14,13:41:03
Ben Fickes,Dang three years ago I was in high school haha seems like so long ago,69,15,13:40:34
Ben Fickes,"Okay haha thanks, just curious",30,5,13:40:18
Erica Yee,Like 3 years ago?,17,4,13:39:43

Ben Fickes,Also where is your profile pic from the article from haha,57,11,13:33:21

Erica Yee,Think I'm just going to go in between volunteering and the movie,64,12,13:28:59

Ben Fickes,Okay sure thing haha. If you end up there I guess you can have two haha,71,16,11:50:27
Erica Yee,Not sure if I can make it,25,7,11:50:08
Erica Yee,Hmm can you leave one behind for me please,42,9,11:50:03
Ben Fickes,Sure! Are you going to be at r and r? Like do you want me to save you one there or not bring one if that makes sense haha,121,29,11:49:13
Erica Yee,Could you save me one please?,29,6,11:41:44
Erica Yee,Ooh good idea,13,3,11:41:29
Ben Fickes,Oh Iâll bring them to r and r,31,8,11:35:39

Ben Fickes,Thank you for sharing,21,4,22:04:28
Ben Fickes,HAHA I can imagine that perfectly,33,6,22:04:24
Erica Yee,Got so scared when she came out,31,7,22:02:26
Erica Yee,Sophie was just in her room,27,6,22:02:21
Erica Yee,Omg was not home alone this whole time,38,8,22:02:16
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,21:24:40
Ben Fickes,Haha ð thatâs amazing. From my lock screen I thought it was Thiago,71,13,21:21:04
Erica Yee,Omg I like this gif,19,5,21:20:00
Ben Fickes,Exactly haha. I was really surprised/nervous when he said yesterday he didnât get a chance to work on anything. But hopefully itâs okay,139,23,21:16:58
Erica Yee,Yay that sounds good,20,4,21:16:29
Erica Yee,Ooh he's the really quiet guy who's been good before right haha,63,12,21:16:17
Ben Fickes,Okay itâs gonna take a bit to set up but Iâm assuming things are working if Marcos pushed it? Obviously will check on that but right now Iâm not worried,158,30,21:15:27
Ben Fickes,Oh I stand corrected the pull wasnât done. Lemme see what we have,67,13,21:14:17
Ben Fickes,Other than that pretty decent,29,5,21:13:53
Ben Fickes,So Marcos still hasnât pushed anything at all which is a little concerning. So we have no enemies in our game. But he says he will so hopefully he does,153,30,21:13:44
Erica Yee,With the soft deadline haha,27,5,21:12:53
Erica Yee,Oh yeah how is that going,25,6,21:12:49
Ben Fickes,At least you'll get most of during the day to yourself right? And yeah I'm gonna try to go to r&r as long as my project is okay,127,28,21:11:49
Erica Yee,The last part of the event is networking so hopefully I can leave before 7 and pop into r&r,91,19,21:10:12
Erica Yee,But yeah really needed this before tomorrow which is covering that CCIS event + going to the pub,96,18,21:09:43

Ben Fickes,Oh that's great! Yeah I'm glad you get to recharge some. Thanks for coming to volunteering even though I know that was probably a lot of interaction too,152,28,21:03:20
Erica Yee,Today was a lot of people interaction which was all good but needed this recharge time haha,91,17,21:02:27
Erica Yee,I'm home alone right now and it's so nice,41,9,21:02:11
Erica Yee,Ooh ok,6,2,21:02:00

Erica Yee,Hm either 150 or 350,20,5,10:49:47
Ben Fickes,"I think Regal is the one by Fenway right? Iâm kinda thinking either we rush from volunteering to Regal, or eat a chill lunch and head to AMC, or hang out and go to any later showing (if you want to wait until later in the day to watch the movie)",247,51,10:41:24

Ben Fickes,I just woke up haha,19,5,9:52:37
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Thatâs great!,24,4,9:52:32
Erica Yee,I have only seen her like twice at church this semester so yay haha,67,14,9:44:12
Erica Yee,My former roommate Roshni is also signing up for volunteering,61,10,9:43:37
Ben Fickes,"Goodnight, hope you sleep well!",31,5,23:43:17
Erica Yee,"Also sleeping soon, good night",30,5,23:42:13
Erica Yee,But yay,7,2,23:42:03
Erica Yee,Tbh don't think I've ever had an actual conversation with him,61,11,23:41:57
Erica Yee,LOL what,8,2,23:41:45
Ben Fickes,I mentioned i went on 5 flights and then was asked for details so I said I visited your family (and the rest of my trip). Shem said âare you guys a thing or do you just really like her familyâ,196,41,23:40:44
Ben Fickes,Of course! Also unrelated but something I forgot about menâs group is that Shem knows about us now (apparently he didnât before),132,22,23:39:53
Erica Yee,Thanks for being interested :),30,5,23:26:51
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs amazing. Thanks for sharing all of that. Iâm glad itâs going well and that seems like a really amazing thing to do,132,24,23:24:15
Erica Yee,"Lol was going to try to make some joke about putting oil on my head and washing my face but too much thinking oh well. I'm fasting from Reddit and Twitter because those are the social media I use just for content like news or if i'm bored and want to be amused. But I don't actually directly communicate with other humans on them like my other social media. This will probably reduce my screentime, which i guess is good haha. but i don't want this to just be self-improvement. i want to use the time  i would usually go to one of these apps to more intentionally talk to God, talk to other humans, and talk to myself (both self-examination and just letting my mind wander). Seems to be going well so far and i already feel the ""extra"" time",740,141,23:22:05
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica :),15,3,23:18:24
Erica Yee,Jk she can't make it,20,5,22:53:19
Erica Yee,Inviting Kristy,15,2,22:45:22
Erica Yee,I can,5,2,22:45:17
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,22:45:16
Ben Fickes,Theyâre away haha. And yeah Iâd love to! Do I need to or are you for both of us?,84,19,22:44:36
Erica Yee,I see Lisa signed up LOL,24,6,22:39:57
Erica Yee,Want to do it?,14,4,22:39:53
Erica Yee,And wait first aletheia has volunteering 10-12 at Susan bailis assisted living (right across from Mass Ave station) this sat,124,20,22:39:50
Erica Yee,Ok thanks no rush! And if you want to hang with your friends that's totally fine too,84,17,22:38:37
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good! Iâll look at times tomorrow probably. And okay I feel like Iâve heard you tell someone but I donât think Iâve heard from you haha so what are you fasting from?,185,34,22:14:23
Erica Yee,"Oh I wanted to ask, I know I mentioned Twitter earlier but I forgot if I actually told you what I'm fasting from? Did I?",120,25,22:13:24
Erica Yee,Pretty sure I'm gonna cry lol,29,6,22:12:38
Erica Yee,Think Saturday would be good,28,5,22:12:24
Ben Fickes,He said he spent a lot of time piercing everything together but he liked it,75,15,22:12:20
Erica Yee,What did he think??,19,4,22:11:40
Ben Fickes,Do you want to go Saturday or do something else/just hang out?,62,12,22:09:42
Ben Fickes,Jason and Rachel watched it haha. Jason hasnât seen the first two. Iâd definitely be down!,94,16,22:08:41
Erica Yee,Would you be down?,18,4,22:08:25
Erica Yee,You're welcome,14,2,22:08:22
Erica Yee,Oh yeah one girl almost spoiled how to train your dragon 3 because some plot thing related to her sharing and now I kinda want to watch it lol,142,29,22:08:10
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing that,23,4,22:07:51
Erica Yee,"I talked about my not trusting God in my physical health. Like going through cycles of praying for healing and then giving up when nothing changes, but not actually receiving a yes or no",186,34,22:07:11
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow. Thatâs intense haha. What did you talk about, if youâre willing to share? Menâs was good, we talked about the parable of the sower. It was pretty good, just me, Jason, Shem, and Dara",196,36,21:49:56
Erica Yee,How was men's?,14,3,21:43:41
Erica Yee,"Straight up ""where is Jesus not Lord of your life"" lol",54,11,21:43:36
Erica Yee,Continually amazed and encouraged by how vulnerably these girls share,69,10,21:43:09
Erica Yee,It was good,11,3,21:42:37
Ben Fickes,How was ENC?,12,3,20:48:51
Erica Yee,HAHA love it,12,3,18:14:19
Ben Fickes,Also random but I was looking through my pics and this is from Disneyland,73,14,17:34:53
Ben Fickes,"No I was anticipating it, that's why I added the clause about social situation haha",83,15,17:34:22
Erica Yee,Ooh ok cool,11,3,17:33:57
Erica Yee,Wow the temptation came quickly,31,5,17:33:47
Ben Fickes,"Yeah it is super late, halfway through finals. My mom's gonna come up for it I think",84,17,17:25:55
Ben Fickes,Haha well truthfully my one exception so far has been the dessert your mom served on Ash Wednesday. And scones for breakfast if that counts? And that sounds awesome haha I'll be looking forward to it :),202,37,17:25:37
Erica Yee,Whoa Easter is so late this year. April 21,42,9,17:24:44
Erica Yee,Ok how about on Easter we go there and have one while I scroll through Twitter LOL,82,17,17:24:23
Erica Yee,"If you were home I would call the first one ""the mom exception""",63,13,17:23:50
Ben Fickes,"Another good idea is that I can dip my burger and chips in the shake to eat it so it's a sauce, not a dessert",109,25,17:22:16
Ben Fickes,And HAHA I laughed out loud to both of those,44,10,17:21:53
Ben Fickes,The exceptions I make are social situations in which someone makes desserts for me and it would be rude to refuse. But since I'm assuming you're not going to pressure me to do it I don't think I can count it as a social situation,229,45,17:21:40
Erica Yee,Lol jk sorry not trying to me stumbling block,45,9,17:21:04
Erica Yee,Or we can have it before dinner so it's not dessert,51,11,17:20:56
Erica Yee,Ok you can sit there while I take hours to finish by myself,59,13,17:20:42
Ben Fickes,"Ooh I do too. But on that note, I gave up desserts for Lent",59,14,17:20:08
Erica Yee,I do want to try a Boston burger shake sometime this semester,61,12,17:19:44
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,17:19:32
Ben Fickes,I guess our ice cream present rate is holding steady at a pint per month haha,77,16,17:13:32
Ben Fickes,Dude I cannot believe that,26,5,17:12:55
Ben Fickes,Whaaaaat,8,1,17:12:50
Erica Yee,Dude can you believe as of tomorrow Valentine's day was a month ago,67,13,17:12:32
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs right. I donât know why I canât remember it, itâs just booyah with an m. Oh well thanks and thanks in advance for the next time I ask you what itâs called",171,33,17:11:32
Erica Yee,And mooyah HAHAHAH,18,3,17:10:22
Erica Yee,I will thank her,16,4,17:10:18
Erica Yee,Aww I'm very touched,20,4,17:10:12
Ben Fickes,Oh and Barbs helped me by getting it from me while you were at volunteering,75,15,17:07:42
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad you liked it :) I wanted to do something to congratulate you for finishing your exam. Oh wow I did not know that was the other one! I just remembered the kind you brought for waffles and that we had a pb shake at mooburger (forget actual name even though you told me) so went off that haha,300,60,17:07:22
Erica Yee,And now I can binge through two cartons together,48,9,17:06:25
Erica Yee,Lol do you remember when I bought ice cream for waffles? I got two because there was a deal and that flavor was the other one that I got. So good job with knowing what I like haha,179,38,17:06:11
Erica Yee,You are so sweet,16,4,17:05:22
Erica Yee,Omg thank you!!!,16,3,17:05:01
Ben Fickes,Take your time!,15,3,16:33:39
Erica Yee,Ok just gonna go to the bathroom I'm coming,43,9,16:33:20
Ben Fickes,If Iâm not too late haha,26,6,16:32:48
Ben Fickes,Yep! Iâm by Forsyth now if you wanna head back,48,10,16:32:01
Erica Yee,Are you walking back?,21,4,16:31:40
Erica Yee,Omg it wasn't terribly difficult (except one question) but it was so long,73,13,16:31:35
Ben Fickes,How did it go?,14,4,16:28:04
Ben Fickes,Sounds good :),14,3,13:37:33
Erica Yee,Haha oh ok yeah let's talk about it later,41,9,12:58:10
Ben Fickes,That makes sense haha. I did! We had a good talk about a lot of different things. I was actually going to message you last night âremind me to tell you about my talk with my momâ but figured youâd be studying and I wouldnât forget haha,243,47,12:50:18
Erica Yee,Did you get to call your mom?,29,7,12:49:16
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,12:49:12
Erica Yee,Inputting into spreadsheet vs. checking what someone else inputted,66,9,12:48:52
Ben Fickes,"Whatâs the difference between the two again? And Iâm good, I didnât go to bed until about 1 (which was my own fault). Still had some trouble falling asleep but nothing was on my mind, think itâs just jet lag. And I got some work done this morning which is good",268,51,12:25:21
Erica Yee,How are you doing?,18,4,12:24:11
Erica Yee,It's chill. Proofreading again. Can't decide whether I like this or the actual indexing more,92,15,12:24:04
Ben Fickes,Thatâs really good! How was/is volunteering (besides the snaps you sent haha),79,12,12:18:14
Erica Yee,Fell asleep much more easily last night,39,7,12:14:59
Erica Yee,Actually pretty good so far today,33,6,12:14:45
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,12:14:32
Ben Fickes,"Oh Iâm really glad you feel less stressed. Itâs gonna be okay whatever happens, even though Iâm sure youâll do great. How are you feeling besides about the exam?",169,29,12:05:43
Erica Yee,After praying about it last night I feel less stressed though still unprepared lol,82,14,12:04:47
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,12:04:29
Ben Fickes,I hope your exam goes well today!,33,7,11:59:32

Erica Yee,ah chichi just messaged the worship team leadership channel for prayers cuz she's leadiing weekly worship acapella by herself and it's so awkward so she was thinking of cancelling but God told her not to,203,35,19:59:40

Ben Fickes,Eh Iâm sure itâs fine.  And you went as a group so I guess thatâs better than being late individually,107,20,17:47:31
Erica Yee,lol my group was late to class even tho we were altogether in wvg which is 5 mins away,86,19,17:38:21
Erica Yee,oh interesting,14,2,17:37:24
Ben Fickes,Barbs just got back and my productivity has dropped sharply while hearing about her day and co op haha,102,19,17:31:55
Ben Fickes,Time to look up catchecumens haha,33,6,17:31:20
Ben Fickes,"Huh thatâs really interesting, thanks for sharing",51,7,17:31:08
Ben Fickes,She's on the phone so I didn't ask her but turns out it was just my second grade reading comprehension skills tripping me up haha,129,25,16:23:44
Erica Yee,and np,6,2,16:23:15

Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,11:22:05
Ben Fickes,"Thanks again for letting me use them. I might work in your apartment if thatâs okay. Glad youâre alright, hope the rest of the day is chill for you. And Iâm pretty good, I think I slept weird physically (probably from sleeping scrunched on the blanket) and right now I donât feel too tired. I do want to share sometime, I know you have your midterm tomorrow so maybe not today but I guess whenever we next have extended time together I can share. Thank you :)",467,87,11:01:46
Erica Yee,How about you? Also would love to hear about your thoughts if you want to share sometime,88,17,10:54:54
Erica Yee,"Class was fine, nobody wanted to answer questions lol. And in doing alright. Went to the gym briefly",100,18,10:54:31
Erica Yee,"Apologies in advance if they are being used, you can leave your laundry in my apartment (or even hang out there) if you need to",127,25,10:53:38
Erica Yee,Sure think I will be at Snell then,34,8,10:52:58
Ben Fickes,Also how was class? And how are you feeling now?,48,10,10:50:01
Ben Fickes,Oh so psych got cancelled (apparently that professor is sick too). So if it works for you I can get the key after systems? It ends at 3:15,138,28,10:49:33
Erica Yee,Ohh wow,7,2,9:56:27
Ben Fickes,Had a ton of stuff on my mind (related to enneagram tangentially haha) and couldnât tell if that was keeping me from sleeping or my not sleeping was giving me opportunity to think about it,190,35,9:02:52
Ben Fickes,"Wait it took me forever to sleep too, I thought about getting up but tried to pray some",87,18,9:02:13
Erica Yee,Omg couldn't sleep for so long until after I think Barbara went to bed which is never a good thing lol. Ended up listening to old Taylor swift music for a while,160,32,7:41:31
Ben Fickes,Idk if that's a night-night or a especially unexclamatory night but either way goodnight,88,14,23:00:38
Erica Yee,Night.,6,1,22:59:53
Erica Yee,Night,5,1,22:59:51
Erica Yee,Yw haha,7,2,22:59:49
Ben Fickes,I was gonna comment âtoo bad I couldnât bid on itâ but guess he beat me to it,83,18,22:58:36
Ben Fickes,Wow what a humble bragger. Jk thanks for showing me haha,56,11,22:58:20
Erica Yee,Wait first thought you'd like to see Joshua's 3rd ig post (major milestone),75,13,22:57:41

Erica Yee,Here!,5,1,20:02:32
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good haha. Just lemme know whenever you get here,60,11,19:50:18
Erica Yee,Heading over soon and bringing the lunch I didn't really eat for dinner haha,76,14,19:49:46
Erica Yee,Haha I will,11,3,18:30:13
Ben Fickes,Well obviously Iâm interested in any interesting parts too,60,9,18:22:43
Ben Fickes,HAHA well if any of them are 5-6 pairs let me know what they say,64,15,18:22:29
Erica Yee,This podcast that I listen to it's a married Christian couple who interview people in their lives and they just teased an upcoming episode in which their married friends talk about their relationship in terms of the enneagram lol,229,39,18:12:15
Erica Yee,Lol no problem and thanks,25,5,18:07:50
Erica Yee,I also ordered a new one (smaller version of current one). Probably not best financial decision but will ease my mind so all good,129,24,18:07:06
Ben Fickes,Okay thatâs perfect! Mine is free. Johns here but he just went out probably to the gym or climbing. It smells a little here because John used three Trader Joeâs bags as trash cans instead of the trash can but Iâll take out the trash haha,243,46,18:06:04
Erica Yee,I'm off to Cambridge to pick up very cheap backup laptop,56,11,18:05:02
Erica Yee,Probably around 8 and is yours free? Can't remember if you said John is still gone too,86,17,18:04:23
Ben Fickes,At whose place and what time do you want to meet up?,52,12,17:52:39
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm glad :) and sure thing! Thanks :),44,9,16:52:05
Erica Yee,Hope you have a good run!,25,6,16:46:45
Erica Yee,And yay ok. I'll pass on groceries but down to study/hang together after dinner?,80,14,16:46:41
Erica Yee,Have been looking for an excuse anyway since my current laptop battery has been dying even before all this,106,19,16:46:16
Erica Yee,Honestly not stressed but think that says more about my financial privilege in having the means to just buy a new laptop than my inner peace lol,144,27,16:45:51
Erica Yee,Aw you're so generous,21,4,16:45:23
Ben Fickes,"I'm gonna go to the store later after I run, do you want to come with? No worries if you're busy though",103,22,16:33:39
Ben Fickes,No ST tonight,13,3,16:33:00
Ben Fickes,I'm about done with my meeting,30,6,14:56:55
Ben Fickes,I know this is extremely extra but do you want mine for class,61,13,14:56:49
Ben Fickes,Oh dang,7,2,14:56:37
Erica Yee,Lol laptop is overheating and still not turning on ahhh,55,10,14:43:31
Ben Fickes,Gotcha be there soon!,21,4,13:24:35
Erica Yee,I'm on the second floor behind where there are curtains sometimes?,66,11,13:24:12
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,10:34:28
Ben Fickes,"âItâs today, Erica. Thanks for remembering.â Haha that wouldâve been good",81,11,10:25:29
Erica Yee,Thanks xP,9,2,10:23:33
Erica Yee,Ok good thing I asked because in my head it was either may 9 or may 21... So close yet so far,93,22,10:23:27
Erica Yee,You should definitely have given me a fake one and watched me make a fool out of myself,87,18,10:23:03
Ben Fickes,Wow Iâm so hurt how could you not remember. Jk itâs May 29 (1998 haha),74,15,10:21:23
Erica Yee,Random but when is your birthday?? I realize I don't know/remember the exact date LOL sorry,91,16,10:20:13
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,10:19:44
Ben Fickes,Awesome Iâll meet you there after class,41,7,9:55:35

Ben Fickes,If that was an invitation for lunch haha,40,8,9:53:07
Ben Fickes,Where at?,9,2,9:52:50
Ben Fickes,Sorry Iâll just let you know my schedule and we can figure it out. I can definitely do lunch though!,102,20,9:52:46
Erica Yee,I was planning to have lunch on campus anyway so just lemme know,64,13,9:52:26
Erica Yee,Haha ok,7,2,9:52:10
Ben Fickes,And I guess if we meet for all of the class time I can walk back with you,73,18,9:49:37
Ben Fickes,So I guess it may not be worth it for an hour but if Iâm meeting during class then I can,90,21,9:49:17
Ben Fickes,I asked my group to see,23,6,9:48:46
Ben Fickes,Thatâs either going to be at 2:20 or instead of the second class (itâs for that class and we were told we can meet in the classroom),136,27,9:48:41
Erica Yee,Thought you had group thing?,28,5,9:46:41
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,9:46:34
Ben Fickes,Do you want to work together between classes or after?,54,10,9:45:20
Ben Fickes,My second class got cancelled haha sorry,40,7,9:45:07
Erica Yee,Walk back together after 4:30 instead?,38,6,9:40:41
Erica Yee,Oh wait I forgot my class is on the other side of campus now,60,14,9:40:01
Erica Yee,We'll see haha,14,3,22:56:17
Ben Fickes,Maybe they can try to convert me to a California team,53,11,22:54:20
Erica Yee,Probably better that you're not into sports than a rival team honestly,70,12,22:48:27
Ben Fickes,Oh no I hope thatâs not the tipping point of your family liking me haha,73,15,22:44:52
Erica Yee,Loool exactly,13,2,22:44:35
Erica Yee,Also I just laugh reacted to my uncle asking if you're a warriors fan instead of replying. He'll find out eventually,116,21,22:44:19
Ben Fickes,I would be surprised if he did comment on a fb post to make me feel special ð,80,18,22:43:31
Erica Yee,I've never seen my cousin Jordan comment on any fb post so you can feel special haha,84,17,22:43:01
Ben Fickes,And just saw the laughing reacts haha,37,7,22:42:13
Ben Fickes,And your dads comment haha,26,5,22:41:55
Ben Fickes,I also love âSo discrete Eâ,31,6,22:41:46

Ben Fickes,Apartment not dorm haha,23,4,19:52:01
Erica Yee,"Sure, never been",16,3,19:51:59
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was thinking that too. How do you feel about pad Thai cafe? Itâs literally a minute from my dorm and pretty fast,121,24,19:51:43
Erica Yee,Idk but probably somewhere fairly fast haha,43,7,19:51:14
Erica Yee,Oh LOL nice!!,13,3,19:50:47
Ben Fickes,Where do you want to eat dinner haha,36,8,19:50:47
Ben Fickes,No the driver says he had no machine so itâs free,51,11,19:50:35
Ben Fickes,But will have a bit of a walk,29,8,19:50:26
Erica Yee,Nah the driver has a device he brings around,44,9,19:50:20
Ben Fickes,No machine on it so itâs free?,32,7,19:49:57
Ben Fickes,I got there right at 7:40 and was worried I missed the bus. But it was just late,80,18,19:49:50

Erica Yee,Sorry ð¢,10,2,19:25:43
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,19:25:36
Ben Fickes,They said they just have to spray it but I think it might be more stuff than just that,86,19,19:22:34
Ben Fickes,Related to weather,18,3,19:22:18
Erica Yee,Did they give a reason?,23,5,19:22:06
Erica Yee,Whaaa,5,1,19:22:03
Ben Fickes,Dang itâs been half an hour and no oneâs gone off the plane,63,13,19:20:11
Ben Fickes,Got it. Thank you haha I feel thoroughly mentally prepared,58,10,19:19:59
Erica Yee,Show them Charlie card but pay with regular card,48,9,19:19:18
Erica Yee,They'll come around later or just do it when you get off,56,12,19:18:51
Erica Yee,Oh and you don't pay when you get on,36,9,19:18:21
Ben Fickes,Iâm expecting chaos so Iâm hoping to be able to make a beeline out of there,79,16,19:15:54
Ben Fickes,Thank you so much,17,4,19:15:28
Erica Yee,Take back Bay and tell them hynes if they ask,45,10,19:15:11
Erica Yee,You walk past the baggage claim following the signs for Logan express and then there's signs outside where you wait,115,20,19:14:45
Erica Yee,Logan was kinda chaos when I got in cuz of all the delays,57,13,19:13:53
Erica Yee,Np thanks for update haha,25,5,19:13:13
Ben Fickes,Oh wait that last message was for Josh oh well,46,10,19:12:08

Ben Fickes,How are you feeling btw? After early morning and flight?,56,10,18:55:15
Ben Fickes,Haha I do not think Iâm gonna be ready for the cold,53,12,18:54:51
Erica Yee,How did 1 week at home make me forget where I've lived most of the last 4 years,79,18,18:53:00
Erica Yee,Lol I saw snow on the ground at legit at first was like what is this stuff,74,17,18:52:44
Erica Yee,Ok no worries,13,3,18:52:30
Ben Fickes,Yeah definitely faster this way. I think it was a tailwind. Still havenât deplaned so sadly it might be a little bit,118,22,18:51:37
Erica Yee,Was yours also only like 4.5 hours in the air?? So fast. Wonder if we had a big tailwind or something,101,21,18:50:51
Erica Yee,I'm on the bus so lemme know whenever you get back,50,11,18:50:07
Erica Yee,Ooh nice,8,2,18:49:49
Ben Fickes,I watched winter soldier and spent the rest of the time on hw. Got a lot done which is awesome,94,20,18:48:15
Ben Fickes,So I guess when weâre both back we can meet up for dinner? But no rush at all of course,89,20,18:47:59
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness Iâm sorry about the book. I just landed. Wow it looks different from CA haha,93,18,18:47:38

Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha hope you can zone out. Or see if one of them wants to trade seats?,86,19,12:57:52
Erica Yee,Just boarded. Sitting in between two student age girls who know each other so think I'm gonna be talked over to the whole flight lol,132,25,12:57:13
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,11:17:13
Ben Fickes,Yeah I agree. Awesome :) now time to pray our flights arenât cancelled haha,77,14,11:06:13

Ben Fickes,And do you want to meet at airport or our places?,49,11,10:40:54
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness. My mom checked it and let me sleep in haha. Do you want to meet up for dinner still?,100,22,10:40:25
Erica Yee,"Dang could've slept more than 4 hours, but this is probanbly time to seriously do homework lol",94,17,10:39:38
Erica Yee,Ah ok 6:40 for now,18,5,10:39:03

Erica Yee,"Ugh looks like mine is delayed till 9am, so eta 5:15pm as of now",64,14,8:49:44
Ben Fickes,Nighty night sleep tight,24,4,3:19:44
Erica Yee,"Lol Tell you tomorrow sleeping now, gnight!",43,7,3:04:14
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but we went to in n out and I got my burger animal style. Honestly could not tell a difference (they put cheese on mine though so thereâs a chance I took Joshs regular burger),192,37,1:51:06
Ben Fickes,How was the show?,17,4,1:50:10
Ben Fickes,Sorry for the late reply my phone ran out of power haha. Yeah I think Iâm gonna be super exhausted tomorrow too. Like you said oh well,136,27,1:50:05
Erica Yee,Gonna be so tired tomorrow oh well,34,7,1:23:44
Erica Yee,And I forgot about daylight savings,35,6,1:23:39
Erica Yee,Lol packing now,15,3,1:23:33
Erica Yee,Yeah the sound stuff mostly,27,5,20:33:01
Ben Fickes,Are you helping setup at church for tomorrow?,45,8,20:02:15
Ben Fickes,Haha ð I showed that to my mom and Josh and they started laughing. Glad your mom approves enough to spread the word haha,123,24,20:02:15
Erica Yee,Lol thanks for spreading the news mom,37,7,19:43:48
Erica Yee,Me: oh. Yes.,12,3,19:43:25
Erica Yee,Him: and they're in town.,25,5,19:43:15
Erica Yee,Me: ...yes,10,2,19:43:01
Erica Yee,"Just saw the pastor and the first thing he says is ""I understand you have a boyfriend. And he has a mom""",104,22,19:42:50
Ben Fickes,Haha very sorry for her but thatâs pretty funny,49,9,19:34:45
Erica Yee,Oh nice! I guess we all forgot it took over tower of terror so when we started going up and then dropping I remember my sister's birthmother gripping my arm so hard while screaming lol,184,35,19:28:01
Ben Fickes,Josh and I decoded their alternate alphabet and it turns out thereâs a sign near the entrance that says (in the other language) âwarning: sudden dropâ,156,26,19:22:53
Ben Fickes,Got to ride toy story but apparently itâs broken now. Just went on the guardians of the galaxy ride,101,19,19:22:06
Ben Fickes,Thanks :) and haha yeah same,28,6,19:21:44
Erica Yee,Yah the end when missiles were about to annihilate Earth it was so low stakes I was rolling my eyes,99,20,18:57:08
Erica Yee,Apparently brie Larson is allergic to cats so the scenes they used a puppet lmao,80,15,18:53:15
Erica Yee,No worries I like hearing your thoughts,39,7,18:52:23
Ben Fickes,Sorry I know we can talk in person haha just have thoughts coming to me,71,15,18:30:27
Ben Fickes,Though the retreat at the end felt weird to me too,50,11,18:30:08
Ben Fickes,"And how quickly and easily she switches sides. But like you said I did like the fighting (even though she felt OP by the end, but I guess thatâs what they were going for and what super heroes are supposed to be)",213,42,18:28:33
Ben Fickes,Oh and Iâm also annoyed at the anticlimactic way Fury lost his eye,68,13,18:27:24
Ben Fickes,I know the cat thing was a joke but it felt weird to me. Also did not think the plot twist was very surprising at all,117,26,18:26:03
Erica Yee,But yeah the fighting and her powers were so cool,49,10,18:16:33
Erica Yee,Disappointed by the writing though. And sometimes hard to follow,64,10,18:16:21
Erica Yee,Honestly better than I expected lol,35,6,18:15:49
Ben Fickes,Haha ð Iâm glad heâs doing it haha. Also hope you enjoy the movie!,73,14,16:03:53
Erica Yee,YES lol totally forgot I told you that,38,8,15:58:05
Erica Yee,Magdalena Boulet,16,2,15:57:49
Ben Fickes,Oooh and is that the one he made the promise to do if he qualified for Boston? Or something like that,101,21,15:52:13
Ben Fickes,Is his leg okay? And thatâs amazing what marathoner? Thatâs so awesome he got to do that,92,17,15:51:21
Erica Yee,Lol idk how he ran 12 miles this morning after he could barely walk yesterday because of his leg hurting but yay,112,22,15:44:36
Erica Yee,As part of this non-profit he is part of running with Oakland public school kids,80,15,15:43:56
Erica Yee,My dad ran with an Olympic marathoner this morning ð®ð®,59,10,15:43:28
Erica Yee,Yep np,6,2,15:39:13
Ben Fickes,Okay that sounds great! Thanks for looking into everything :),61,10,14:54:08
Erica Yee,And I'm pretty sure they have lent stuff,40,8,14:46:30
Erica Yee,That would be convenient cuz we could take the Logan express bus to Copley,74,14,14:46:18
Erica Yee,The one that's been under construction for a while,50,9,14:45:48
Erica Yee,I was looking up evening services and Trinity Church (the big Episcopal one in Copley square) has a 6pm,103,19,14:44:08
Erica Yee,Doesn't matter but I am kinda skeptical we can get to aletheia on time since it requires transferring,101,18,14:43:21
Ben Fickes,"Iâm good with either, do you have a preference?",49,9,14:36:59
Erica Yee,"Oh speaking of tomorrow, if we get in on time are you ok with aletheia or do you want to find another church service? Cuz don't think aletheia observes lent",156,30,14:30:21
Erica Yee,Yep!,4,1,14:28:07
Ben Fickes,Ooh let me know what you think of Captain Marvel (ofc we can talk tomorrow too). And let me know how west side is too please,124,26,14:24:40
Erica Yee,"We are watching captain marvel soon, then picking up an uncle later and seeing west side story",94,17,14:22:37
Erica Yee,Ohhh scary lol. That must've replaced California screaming,58,8,14:21:58
Ben Fickes,What are you doing today?,25,5,14:20:13
Ben Fickes,"Oh man Iâm so sorry. And yeah Josh and I would try to find secrets in all the levels haha. And itâs pretty good, the âplotâ is finding Jack Jack. The start is Elastigirl says âJack run!â And it shoots you super fast. Then itâs just appearances from other characters and a loop-de-loop. Hope that was a good description haha",337,60,14:20:05
Erica Yee,What's the Incredibles one like? (If you have time),51,9,14:18:08
Erica Yee,Toy story is fun! It's a bunch of mini games shooting stuff,59,12,14:17:49
Erica Yee,Oh yess cars is always super popular. It broke while we were in line last time :(,81,17,14:17:39
Ben Fickes,Gonna try to go on Toy Story after this I think because I remember from Disneyworld it was really good,102,20,14:16:08
Ben Fickes,Yep! We got one for incredibles and one for Cars (at 5:15...),61,12,14:15:44
Erica Yee,Are you guys using fast pass?,29,6,14:10:02
Erica Yee,Hope it's fun haha,18,4,14:09:56
Ben Fickes,We went on the incredibles ride,31,6,14:08:37
Ben Fickes,It is so crowded here my goodness,33,7,14:08:20
Erica Yee,Oh nice,7,2,13:29:20
Ben Fickes,She and Josh have been before and I think thatâs the one they went to,71,15,10:57:49
Ben Fickes,"Oh I think thatâs the one weâre going to, I remember my mom mentioning that ride",84,16,10:57:31
Erica Yee,Good night!,11,2,2:16:50
Erica Yee,And apparently the new Incredibles one just opened,50,8,2:16:44
Erica Yee,Yep the new guardians ride is there (which replaced tower of terror),68,12,2:16:34
Ben Fickes,Also Iâm going to bed now so goodnight! Talk to you soon,58,12,2:15:45
Ben Fickes,Is that one of the parks? Forget which one weâre going to but Iâll let you know,83,17,2:15:31
Erica Yee,The only one I've been to recently is California adventure,58,10,2:15:08
Erica Yee,To both haha,12,3,2:12:10
Erica Yee,Ooh fun,7,2,2:11:53
Ben Fickes,Josh and my mom and I played some DnD this evening. Thereâs a slight chance weâre going to Universal tomorrow but probably Disneyland,137,23,2:08:04
Ben Fickes,Wow that sounds super amazing. Thank you for sharing all of that :) and Iâm glad you and Julia had an opportunity to go!,122,24,2:07:22
Erica Yee,Oh and I like both haha. Like I have my electronic music and then I always look for the acoustic versions too,109,22,1:53:45
Erica Yee,"Even though it wasn't a ""Christian"" concert it was so cool to hear people, especially in the Bay area, sing along to her psalm 42 song and cheer when she mentioned her gospel album ð",185,35,1:51:16
Erica Yee,And she did everything from her early songs to covers she auditioned on TV shows with to songs from her new album,113,22,1:50:16
Erica Yee,Her voice is incredible,23,4,1:46:07
Erica Yee,But it was super good ðð,30,6,1:46:01
Erica Yee,Ok electric guitar is not acoustic!!!,37,6,1:45:39
Ben Fickes,Ohhh hmm guess that makes sense. Do you like acoustic more or less than non-acoustic?,85,15,23:12:50
Erica Yee,"We were wondering why the stage just has a couch on it and apparently this tour is ""the acoustic sessions,"" which is why it's so soon after her previous one lol",160,31,23:11:22
Erica Yee,Cult of darkness (Julia's phone),32,5,23:09:06
Ben Fickes,Josh saw the pic and says he would like to know how to join your cult,69,16,23:08:13
Ben Fickes,You look like you're telling a ghost story by a campfire,56,11,23:08:00
Erica Yee,Trying to take pictures at a concert rip,40,8,23:07:28
Ben Fickes,Well thatâs good :),21,4,23:05:03
Erica Yee,"Yeah the book is actually really good, it's just long haha",58,11,22:57:28
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs awesome! I hope you could recharge some with time to yourself?,74,13,22:55:46
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I'll let you know how it is",35,8,22:55:23
Erica Yee,Today was the one day that it's just our family at home before one uncle stays over tomorrow so we had dinner together,118,23,22:55:15
Ben Fickes,Dang thatâs a lot. Also I just saw your snap have fun at the concert!!!,73,15,22:54:50
Erica Yee,Pretty restful. Read 4 of the 10 chapters of a book for bostonography (total is almost 300 pages ð),102,19,22:54:27
Ben Fickes,How's your day been so far?,27,6,22:50:31
Erica Yee,Interesting x),14,2,22:49:31
Ben Fickes,"And he's bald, if that tips your handsomeness scale one way or the other",72,14,22:39:56
Ben Fickes,But I would say he seemed a little older than the age people are usually considered handsome at,95,18,22:39:33
Erica Yee,Haha alright,12,2,22:39:21
Ben Fickes,Well maybe I am not one to judge,32,8,22:38:43
Erica Yee,Was he handsome still though,28,5,22:37:40
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,22:37:35
Ben Fickes,I got to witness Handsome Jack today. He does not look like Handsome Jack from Borderlands,90,16,20:59:20
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,17:22:22
Ben Fickes,He hasnât yet. Just gotta hope he doesnât in the next two days ð¤,71,14,17:20:32
Erica Yee,I hope Josh doesn't disown you,30,6,17:19:21
Erica Yee,thanks for the heads up,23,5,17:19:11
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,17:19:08
Ben Fickes,This is incredibly random and I know unnecessary but I wanted to let you know that my face will be very hairy when you see me on Sunday because I did not bring a razor haha,172,36,17:07:20
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Crazy how close it is already,38,8,17:06:34
Erica Yee,Yep. Was able to use my Alaska miles to get one on the last Friday of finals,76,17,16:41:51
Ben Fickes,For end of semester? And gotcha hope you get some time to relax too,67,14,15:46:37
Erica Yee,currently looking for flights home but think i'm gonna do homework later as well,80,14,15:45:55
Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,15:45:41
Ben Fickes,Iâm doing homework while we do Joshs laundry haha. Josh is doing hw too. Idk if my mom and I will do something during his classes later or if Iâll just work. So might be just meals and evening hanging with Josh. What about you?,231,45,15:29:25
Erica Yee,What are you guys up to today?,30,7,15:28:04
Erica Yee,Ok I'm glad haha,16,4,15:27:58
Ben Fickes,No it was great meeting her! She's so smart. And honestly it may have just been my bad assumption. Also your mom mentioned something to my mom because my mom mentioned someone else might be there? Really it was great seeing more of your family,243,45,15:17:07
Erica Yee,But hope it wasn't too uncomfortable for you guys ð¬,54,10,15:16:07
Erica Yee,"Also sorry again for not being clear that Diana was staying at our house, though my mom was like your mom may have protested more if she knew lol",145,29,15:15:34
Erica Yee,Yeah of course. I don't really know how to process it though,60,12,15:13:25
Ben Fickes,Well Iâm glad Iâm not dragging you down haha ð also glad I spark such emotional depth in you haha ð are you okay if I ask you about the family stuff on Sunday? Iâm curious to hear your thoughts but donât want to bother you with it if you want a break from talking about it,286,57,14:58:57
Erica Yee,"But she thinks we're good for each other, especially how us spending time together leads me to have to talk about my thoughts and feelings more lol",147,27,14:56:27
Erica Yee,"""umm it's good""",15,3,14:55:09
Erica Yee,"Which she thought was lacking in emotional depth. So then she was like ""ok then tell me how you feel about having a boyfriend"" ð",131,25,14:54:16
Erica Yee,"About the family stuff. And I was just like idk, it's all very sudden and I'm going along with it",97,20,14:53:11
Erica Yee,My mom wanted to talk about my feelings lol,43,9,14:52:47
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,14:02:45
Ben Fickes,Alaska 1360,11,2,13:09:19
Erica Yee,Mine's Alaska 1350,18,3,12:57:18
Erica Yee,What's your flight number?,26,4,12:56:47
Erica Yee,And if we don't get delayed,27,6,12:56:43
Erica Yee,Yeah ofc,8,2,12:56:36
Ben Fickes,Sounds good! If youâre good with waiting haha,47,8,12:47:58
Erica Yee,So I guess we'll meet up at Logan and figure out to get there?,62,14,12:28:21
Erica Yee,Ok same,7,2,12:26:41
Ben Fickes,So I though about it and I would like to try to make it to church on Sunday night,81,19,11:35:36
Ben Fickes,You too :),10,3,2:15:08
Erica Yee,Ok sleep well :),16,4,1:37:24
Erica Yee,Aww haha,8,2,1:37:09
Ben Fickes,Just got back to Joshs dorm. I think weâre gonna talk and do homework and then Iâm going to go back to the hotel to sleep,125,26,1:35:37
Ben Fickes,Itâs been good! Iâve gotten to spend more time with just Josh which is nice. I like his friends but they are all pretty high energy and tire me out haha. I can explain more in person but they also make Josh a lot more energized and I just feel like a tired old man haha,273,56,1:35:11
Erica Yee,Oh interesting. How was spending time with him and his friends?,63,11,1:17:27
Erica Yee,Ok we'll see if we have time/what we feel like haha,51,11,1:17:09
Ben Fickes,"Oh and sorry one more captain marvel thing: one of Joshs friends said âwhen you think about it, that movie was basically Frozen.â So you can see if you agree or disagree haha",178,33,1:07:04
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha haha well if you wanna see it Iâd be down, or we can go to another movie or do something else",102,22,1:06:15
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good,14,3,1:05:05
Erica Yee,Think*,6,1,1:04:43
Erica Yee,I have. I was just looking and showtimes and saw the third one is out now and then saw it had really good ratings. But plot according to trailer made me thing haven't we already been over this so idk,199,40,1:04:24
Ben Fickes,No worries haha i can tell you general thoughts Sunday but my mom and I talked about it today which made me think of it,119,25,1:03:31
Erica Yee,But yes I would like that and think it would be fine :) honestly cannot think that far ahead right now though,109,22,1:02:40
Ben Fickes,Have you?,9,2,1:01:35
Ben Fickes,Yeah I have,11,3,1:01:31
Ben Fickes,HAHA I think I have,19,5,1:01:27
Erica Yee,Wow I was gonna ask if you've seen the first two how to train your dragon movies,80,17,1:01:06
Ben Fickes,Oh also I can talk to you about this on Sunday but in short if youâre okay with it I might be able to visit again this summer (but again only if you and your family are okay with it),184,40,1:00:41
Ben Fickes,HAHA wow what deep secrets lie in your house,44,9,1:00:00
Erica Yee,It was under the plate hahaha,29,6,0:58:23
Ben Fickes,Haha ð Iâm glad. And OH itâs those rocks. I definitely remember haha glad you found the sheet,100,18,0:54:12
Erica Yee,Oh when you were here in the living room (still mind-blowing) didn't we briefly look at the plate of rocks on an end table?,123,24,0:49:42
Erica Yee,Although I've read two books since then so thoughts getting mixed up unfortunately so I'm glad we're talking about it before talking to her about it lmao,153,27,0:48:46
Ben Fickes,Also what were the rocks haha,29,6,0:48:06
Ben Fickes,Oh yes please!,14,3,0:48:00
Ben Fickes,Okay haha then we can talk about it if you have thoughts,56,12,0:47:53
Erica Yee,Oh yeah we also have to talk about chichi's book in person,58,12,0:47:51
Erica Yee,"That makes perfect sense haha, thanks. Think I'll try to see it here then",73,14,0:47:26
Ben Fickes,Yeah and definitely entertaining,32,4,0:46:24
Ben Fickes,"Oh wow thanks for sharing that!! And yeah I think so. I would say itâs pretty standard as far as super hero movies go (with the exception again of the feminist aspect). So if you like super hero movies itâs worth seeing in theaters, but for example I would not recommend to my mom to see it in theaters",306,59,0:45:52
Erica Yee,Ok so you think it's worth seeing in theaters? Like it's enjoyable and entertaining enough even if it's not an amazing movie?,125,22,0:44:23
Erica Yee,"Diana asked us to call her haopo which is literally ""good grandmother"" (lol). Never heard that specific phrase before but ð¤·",126,21,0:43:51
Erica Yee,Oh yah you're good! So in cantonese you call your maternal grandmother popo (paternal is different) so that's what we grew up calling our (now we know) adopted grandmother,171,29,0:43:04
Ben Fickes,Oh 5. Cat was weird and random (will make sense after you watch it),67,14,0:42:15
Ben Fickes,"Okay general thoughts:
1. Plot was alright. Plot twist was pretty obvious
2. Liked the fight scenes
3. Pretty feminist (sometime pretty overtly)
4. Have thoughts on religion in movies Iâll tell you about in person",215,36,0:41:48
Erica Yee,Oh take your time haha,22,5,0:41:38
Ben Fickes,"Before I send my thoughts, I do have a random question. So you just referred to Diana as haopo, but I remember (I think) you referred to your moms adopted mom as popo? I feel like Iâm misspelling it but I think it was something like that. Whatâs the difference between the two?",281,53,0:40:38
Ben Fickes,Dang I have to start calling you Rachel Chu. Okay so Iâm about to get on the subway back but will message later. I can tell you more in person and also more after youve seen it,178,37,0:39:19
Erica Yee,"We played mj again and the first time I won, it was with the same 8 of bamboo that I won with yesterday and that was the winning card in crazy rich asians ð thought it was funny",180,38,0:24:14
Erica Yee,Sorry haopo = diana,19,4,0:23:09
Erica Yee,Just said bye to uncle (who's coming back Saturday) and to haopo (who's leaving early tomorrow morning) so would love to hear about it!,135,24,0:23:03
Erica Yee,Oh wow so not midnight haha,27,6,0:22:16
Ben Fickes,Just finished Captain Marvel. Know youâre with family (and examining rocks?) and also are planning to watch it but I can give you general thoughts later haha,159,27,0:14:40
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I agree haha. Iâm very curious, I still feel like thereâs a lot we havenât seen in that game",103,20,17:47:22
Erica Yee,So ok cool. When/if we have more time this semester I want to continue subnautica if you're up for it anyway,108,21,17:46:49
Erica Yee,Don't think I lose data cuz I used to play it on previous laptops so it must've transferred over through steam,110,21,17:45:56
Ben Fickes,Or both is fine,15,4,17:44:50
Ben Fickes,As far as which one take your pick haha,39,9,17:44:43
Ben Fickes,Yeah I would love to play all or games but we have so many I think realistically we wonât play them all soon. And yeah do you lose save data if you uninstall it?,163,34,17:44:35
Erica Yee,Probably not gonna play the latter anytime soon either but i have so many memories there it feels wrong lol,107,20,17:44:13
Erica Yee,BTW we're probably not gonna play destiny 2 for a while yeah? Thinking of uninstalling that and/or borderlands 2,112,19,17:43:40
Erica Yee,Haha I appreciate it,20,4,17:42:37
Ben Fickes,No worries! I completely understand and have definitely sent short and/or nonsense messages to you in NY while gaming. No problem :) I just know your family was very welcoming to me and I wanted to make sure you know my mom is happy too even if she doesnât show it as outwardly,279,53,17:34:52
Erica Yee,"Ok sorry I should not text while gaming cuz I didn't have time to finish my thought before I came back to life, but thanks for telling me that about your mom :)",160,33,17:31:20
Ben Fickes,Haha probably,13,2,17:24:29
Erica Yee,I think she really just liked the protein style in n out burger,63,13,17:23:37
Ben Fickes,Huh I feel like it was the same thing with Ashe? Like people talked about testing her before she actually âcame outâ for everyone? So idk how that works,156,29,17:22:38
Ben Fickes,Also my mom texted the in n out pic of us to her friends. So idk how much but clearly she has been talking about and looking forward to this trip to visit you,158,34,17:21:56
Erica Yee,I don't see the new character tho,33,7,17:21:52
Erica Yee,Yup ofc haha,12,3,17:21:48
Ben Fickes,What character? Moira?,22,3,17:20:43
Ben Fickes,Whoah MLG right here,20,4,17:20:34
Erica Yee,But playing a few rounds of overwatch right now and it's perfectly fine. I got 30 elims and gold (but we lost) so guess my computer is ok xD,140,29,17:08:34
Erica Yee,Lol thought my computer was being slow when I was doing email and stuff and was worried it was the water damage,111,22,17:07:36
Erica Yee,Yay,3,1,17:06:38
Ben Fickes,Thanks for all the pics! And the article. We just landed!,57,11,17:01:26

Erica Yee,Will send mine in a bit,23,6,15:30:56
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,15:30:50
Erica Yee,LMAO,4,1,15:30:48
Ben Fickes,And now the best two,20,5,15:23:29
Erica Yee,Lol yikes,9,2,15:11:22
Ben Fickes,Oh theyâre boarding now haha,30,5,15:04:39
Ben Fickes,They are âwaiting for the mechanics to fill out some paperworkâ so we havenât boarded yet,95,16,15:04:33
Erica Yee,Yay ok x),9,3,14:39:37
Ben Fickes,Haha I can tell she did a lot,29,8,14:35:51
Erica Yee,Oh well actually I hope she did haha,36,8,14:34:01
Erica Yee,And you're very welcome :) glad you and your mom enjoyed it,59,12,14:33:49
Erica Yee,Whoa that was fast,18,4,14:33:24
Ben Fickes,"I really canât say it enough but thank you to you and your entire family, they are extremely hospitable and kind and I felt very welcomed and at home. You are all amazing :)",175,34,14:28:15
Ben Fickes,Of course! And we are at our gate,33,8,14:27:23
Erica Yee,Let me know when you land please?,33,7,14:17:24
Erica Yee,"Username: ThomasKirche
Pw: solideogloria",40,4,1:56:42
Ben Fickes,Yep toward end,14,3,14:12:24
Erica Yee,Are you near the end?,21,5,14:12:02
Erica Yee,Beige camry,11,2,14:11:21
Ben Fickes,Awesome! :),11,2,14:09:43
Erica Yee,Kk be right there,17,4,14:09:36
Ben Fickes,Southwest 2,11,2,14:09:23
Erica Yee,Oh ok we're coming from park and call,37,8,14:09:23
Erica Yee,Ok when she's done can you walk out near the end of terminal 2,62,14,14:09:14
Ben Fickes,Weâre outside now,19,3,14:09:08
Ben Fickes,So as an update we are by baggage claim and my mom is using the restroom. Again no rush but want to keep you posted,115,25,14:08:28
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey take your time!,25,4,13:57:44
Erica Yee,Cool we're on the way,21,5,13:57:27
Ben Fickes,Plane just touched down - will keep you posted when we get off etc.,67,14,13:56:58
Erica Yee,Yay ok,6,2,12:30:25
Ben Fickes,Weâre on the plane! Seeya soon :),35,7,12:29:36
Ben Fickes,I will make sure to ask for each of these tonight haha,54,12,12:13:16
Erica Yee,You can be slightly amused while you wait by this thing my dad just sent,72,15,12:01:42
Erica Yee,Oh yay,6,2,11:58:38
Ben Fickes,No worries! The flight got delayed then un-delayed so I think weâll be flying soon?,85,15,11:50:35
Erica Yee,Omg no I'm sorry,16,4,11:02:18
Ben Fickes,My mom is texting your mom the flight info,42,9,9:31:35
Ben Fickes,"Sooo our flight got cancelled. Trying to book another one, will keep you posted",79,14,9:26:37
Erica Yee,Hope you sleep well,19,4,2:03:51
Erica Yee,Thank you!! ð This is more than I could ask for,50,11,2:03:37
Ben Fickes,"Also Iâm going to bed now but lemme know if you have any other questions, Iâll answer in the morning. See you tomorrow :)",125,24,2:01:15
Ben Fickes,*then,5,1,2:00:01
Ben Fickes,"Of course no pressure on your mom, she could talk about the weather and I think my mom would be happy but if this helps her feel less stressed than here it is",158,33,1:59:45
Ben Fickes,"HAHA like I said my mom really likes your mom so she will probably ask a lot of questions too. Here are some ideas that I can think of:

Talking about Josh and me (probably more Josh since Iâll be there, like what made him choose USC and what he studies. She low key likes to brag about him studying there haha)

What does she do in Delaware while weâre at college (sheâll probably talk about her Bible study. She doesnât like people worrying about her so she usually responds better if itâs framed not with a tone of worry haha if that makes sense)

What brought her to Delaware (sheâll probably talk about my dad some and moving for his work)

Where is she from before DE (she might talk about Kansas)

And honestly my mom doesnât talk to Josh and me much about herself so I feel like I find out new things when she talks with other adults haha",860,162,1:58:09
Ben Fickes,Oh my sleep schedule has been a little messed up haha,53,11,1:54:00
Erica Yee,My mom is asking me what conversation topics to talk to your mom about lol,74,15,1:43:55
Erica Yee,Hope jetlag isn't treating you too badly,40,7,1:34:33
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm excited,16,3,1:34:22
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs good to hear! And awesome, thanks so much :) canât believe itâs actually tomorrow haha. See you soon ð",118,20,1:31:53
Erica Yee,"Also before I forget, we'll be in park and call tomorrow at the airport so just text me when you guys are ready to be picked up",127,27,1:23:01
Erica Yee,Just got back from dinner. Ate sooo much. And it went actually quite well,73,14,1:07:37
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,15:57:57
Ben Fickes,"No, he had a class cancelled but said he wanted to do hw. So heâs in class now and weâre meeting him in about an hour",121,26,15:48:02
Erica Yee,Did you guys see Josh yet?,26,6,15:47:22
Erica Yee,Yupp thanks,11,2,15:47:11
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I hope itâs okay! You and Barbs have bad luck with laptops I guess haha,88,18,15:46:22
Ben Fickes,Yeah. I kept thinking theyâd get rescued in the end,53,10,15:46:00
Erica Yee,Lol I was about to do homework but then I spilled some water in my laptop ð so now drying it out and hoping for the best,123,27,15:46:00
Erica Yee,When the title came up I was like omg this is such deep emotional writing,73,15,15:45:25
Erica Yee,Oh dang yeah it is,18,5,15:45:03
Ben Fickes,It's intense haha,17,3,15:16:17
Ben Fickes,"Don't want to take your time and we can talk about it later, but I just finished Chichi's book",94,19,15:16:12
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,15:13:38
Ben Fickes,oh my goodness this sounds like quite the event. I hope it goes well and if you feel like talking about it would love to hear about it at some point,148,31,15:05:34
Erica Yee,oh yeah she will be,19,5,15:04:51
Erica Yee,my bio grandmother's friend from uc berkeley days will also be there and he's this rich 90 year old gay chinese man so i'm very interested to see what he's like haha,165,32,15:04:46
Ben Fickes,I will pray too. I meant her birth mom,38,9,15:04:08
Erica Yee,and yep that's what i'm praying ð¬,36,7,15:03:51
Erica Yee,"not her adopted mom, she doesn't leave her assisted living place anymore",72,12,15:03:36
Ben Fickes,Is the dinner with your moms mom too? And wow glad the food will be good at least haha. Hopefully in the spirit of reunion everyone will be kind to each other,158,32,14:22:40
Erica Yee,The nicest Chinese restaurant in Oakland though so yay delicious food,69,11,14:21:37
Erica Yee,So that will be interesting lol,31,6,14:21:21
Erica Yee,Np! I'm running errands with my mom rn and then we have a fancy dinner tonight which is very stressful because my mom's half brothers are going to be there and they don't have the greatest relationship with their mom,216,40,14:21:16
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening haha. What are you up to today?,52,10,14:16:47
Erica Yee,LOL oh yeah huh,15,4,14:12:06
Ben Fickes,Oh and also sheâs telepathic so why is he able to deceive her? Ugh still bothers me,85,17,14:10:53
Erica Yee,Whaaa rip,9,2,14:09:33
Ben Fickes,"Yeah Tina has very few lines and her sister (Queenie?) joins Grindelwald (which makes no sense because heâs anti-muggle and sheâs in love with Jacob, the muggle dude)",170,28,13:53:54
Erica Yee,Oh well,7,2,13:48:25
Erica Yee,Nooo I loved the girls in the first one,39,9,13:48:17
Ben Fickes,Also I think they milk cool spells and Dumbledore just existing too much,72,13,13:41:56
Ben Fickes,Yeah I can rant about it in person but I feel like nothing actually happened and they changed the characters a lot. And there were so many new characters that besides Newt and Grindelwald none of the old characters did much (imho),230,42,13:41:27
Erica Yee,^ about Grindelwald,19,3,13:28:37
Erica Yee,Lol really? Think I'll read the Wikipedia then,46,8,13:28:29
Erica Yee,Oh nice okay,12,3,13:27:36
Ben Fickes,"Flight was long of course but not bad. Did some systems work, read Chichiâs book (though got very self conscious when my mom would glance at my screen) and watched Crimes of Grindlewald (was really not that good)",214,38,13:21:52
Ben Fickes,Thanks! Nope it is actually sunny (for now haha),48,9,13:20:56
Erica Yee,And how was the flight?,23,5,13:19:40
Erica Yee,Yay welcome to the west coast! Is it raining down there too lol,63,13,13:19:36
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think youâre right. I have about ten pages left of the story. And we just landed in LA!,96,20,13:17:15
Erica Yee,Yeah I was wondering that too. Also I think she's the eldest of 5 children as well iirc,87,18,12:10:08
Ben Fickes,"Wow dang Iâm impressed you were able to track it down. Iâm like halfway through the book I think. Yeah itâs pretty dark. I wonder what made her want to write about such dark stuff. I also wonder how much of the main character is based off her (I know she did dance and is pre-med). So Iâll probably ask her about that in Boston. Have other thoughts too, but I will tell you about them in person sometime",411,79,5:04:08
Erica Yee,Will have to read it someday,28,6,0:31:22
Erica Yee,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27865146-finding-you,56,1,0:31:17
Erica Yee,Lemme try to find it,20,5,0:28:51
Erica Yee,"Actually just reminded me that at aletheia's Easter eggstravaganza last year I was chatting with the church admin, and she said she was a writer who had published a book about human trafficking",193,33,0:28:48
Erica Yee,Very good and engrossing though,31,5,0:25:26
Erica Yee,But dang gets really dark,25,5,0:25:06
Erica Yee,And hopeful,11,2,0:24:55
Erica Yee,Omg just read Chichi's book it's so depressing,46,8,0:24:35
Erica Yee,HAHAHA true though,18,3,21:31:28
Ben Fickes,Also his poor team though,25,5,20:33:02
Ben Fickes,And wow yet another reason Iâm glad we were friends before we started dating ððð it would have been such a tragedy if I had never gotten to play Overwatch or Borderlands or Destiny 2 because we were too busy dating,225,41,20:32:45
Ben Fickes,Ah I see,8,3,20:31:01
Erica Yee,Although they don't even play an actual round before they start kissing #tragedy,80,13,20:24:42
Erica Yee,And that guy chooses tracer so think the author sorta knows what he's talking about? x),87,16,20:21:10
Erica Yee,Lol I mean kind of? he's bringing it over to another guy's house for a date,75,16,20:20:32
Ben Fickes,âEven though it was a single player gameâ what,50,9,20:17:00
Erica Yee,Lol part of the culture now,27,6,19:31:50
Erica Yee,Yeah let's talk about it in person haha,39,8,19:21:28
Erica Yee,Ooh thanks for sharing,22,4,19:21:20
Ben Fickes,Okay so I realize we can definitely talk in person about this. But the short of it is that I like to feel proud about going to a (sorta?) public charter school for high school. But I went to a private school for elementary and middle school which was definitely not cheap and even my high school was very academically strong and had it been private my parents probably wouldâve paid for me to be there. I guess it fits in a lot with privilege in general. Iâll talk to you in person sometime but I have thoughts on my career/calling connected to privilege I actually want to talk to you about sometime,604,113,18:13:16
Erica Yee,"Sounds good, thanks",19,3,17:55:20
Ben Fickes,"I have some thoughts on private/public school but Iâm trying to run before it gets dark so Iâll send them later. And great, no pressure but I would love to talk to you about it haha",185,36,17:29:26
Erica Yee,"And oh nice! Forgot about that. I might have time this evening, then we could talk about it",91,18,17:22:02
Erica Yee,But eh I'm very grateful for the education I got (even though I managed to barely retain any Chinese lmao),106,20,17:21:21
Erica Yee,The high school in the book is fictional but definitely based on current ones,77,14,17:20:27
Erica Yee,Just started the one I'm reading so don't have many thoughts yet but one thing is it brings up the slight guilt I feel sometimes about having the means to go to private school. Oakland public schools did not have a great reputation which is a big reason why my parents only sent us to one for elementary school,310,59,17:19:58
Ben Fickes,Oh speaking of reading I started Chichiâs book!,49,8,17:11:36
Ben Fickes,Donât worry your secret is safe with me haha. Oh wow thanks for sharing all of that. Would love to hear about the book youâre reading if you have thoughts,158,30,17:11:23
Erica Yee,But anyway I think this the first novel my dad has read in DECADES and only cuz it's set in Oakland. Hella depressing though so don't think I'm going to read anytime soon,170,33,17:07:25
Erica Yee,"I started this new YA book called ""anger is a gift"" that is set in Oakland. Mentioned it to my dad yesterday and he said he's reading this book called ""there there"" which is also set in Oakland. There there was on all the best books of 2018 lists cuz it's by/about this native American",285,55,17:06:34
Erica Yee,Oh speaking of Oakland,22,4,17:04:21
Erica Yee,Don't tell her this please but we're not going to our church's Ash Wednesday service cuz my mom doesn't want to being you guys to that part of Oakland #pride,157,30,17:04:05
Ben Fickes,"No but I was gonna mention that to you! I never remembered it was in Oakland and when we watched it I was like âwow, Oakland!0",128,26,17:03:53
Erica Yee,Ooh ok. Did she comment on Oakland in the movie lol,51,11,17:03:12
Ben Fickes,I wanted to watch spider verse with her because she hasnât seen that but it was twenty dollars and black panther was free on Netflix,134,25,17:02:53
Ben Fickes,She said she liked it but didnât really elaborate more. And we had to pause a few times for me to explain what was happening haha. She also said it was very intense,166,33,17:02:28
Erica Yee,Oh! What did she think?,23,5,16:59:50
Ben Fickes,"Oh nice! To both! Hope you have a good time walking! Donât think I told you this but my mom and I watched Black Panther last night, it was her first time seeing it",165,34,16:59:32
Erica Yee,Think my parents and I are going to walk around the lake later,62,13,16:57:05
Erica Yee,Played through my hairspray soundtrack book and going through Disney songs now haha,83,13,16:56:18
Ben Fickes,"You did haha. Glad you get some time to chill. And thatâs awesome, what songs?",80,15,16:53:02
Erica Yee,It's been chill. Think I snapped but our internet is down as usual lol. I've been playing a lot of piano which has been really good,131,26,16:46:20
Erica Yee,Haha nice,9,2,16:45:23
Ben Fickes,Howâs your day going?,23,4,16:41:58
Ben Fickes,It was sparked by asking who took the Boston Burger photo of me eating the burger haha,86,17,16:41:49
Ben Fickes,It was good! We went to a burrito place called El Diablo. It was me and four of my friends. Two left early but the two who were there later got to hear about us dating haha,172,37,16:41:25
Erica Yee,And my mom just laughed lol,27,6,16:40:40
Erica Yee,"No worries, how was the lunch?",30,6,16:40:30
Ben Fickes,Sorry for the late reply I was at lunch with friends for three hours,68,14,16:39:07
Ben Fickes,"And HAHA again, what was your momâs reaction?",47,8,16:38:50
Ben Fickes,HAHA this might be super weird but I am excited to see what psychoanalysis questions your family asks haha,106,19,16:38:31
Erica Yee,"Also my mom asked if we argued yet and I was like ""uh we talked about arguing"" ðð",87,18,14:10:22
Erica Yee,We've been talking about the enneagram a LOT a lot and I mentioned you're a 6 so sorry if you get extremely psychoanalyzed when you're here lol,143,27,14:10:03
Erica Yee,LOL wow,7,2,13:14:52
Ben Fickes,"So now we might have a hamster, guinea pig, or rat (!)",54,12,12:34:47
Ben Fickes,John just contacted me asking how I feel about a pet for the apartment haha,75,15,12:34:29
Ben Fickes,Wow guess I remembered the important part haha. Hope mass is good!,66,12,13:31:38
Erica Yee,Omg that's hilarious,20,3,13:23:44
Erica Yee,Ayce = all you can eat ð,27,7,13:23:40
Ben Fickes,Also we are playing apples to apples at church so clearly apples are important today haha,89,16,13:19:16
Ben Fickes,I think you mentioned it. All I remember is itâs all you can eat haha. What is ayce?,86,18,13:18:56
Erica Yee,At first I was like need to mentally prepare for socializing. But since it's ayce I think I can just stuff myself the whole time lol,132,26,13:17:12
Erica Yee,Did I tell you about that already? Forgot sorry,47,9,13:16:16
Erica Yee,We're going to mass (hope converse are ok cuz didn't bring any a nicer shoes home) and then I'm going to ayce kbbq with my sister's fellowship,142,27,13:16:07
Ben Fickes,Wow thank you for the visual haha ð,38,8,12:51:20
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,12:49:57
Ben Fickes,Very random but wanted to share: I was assisting minister and a line from one of the prayers was âyou have called us from all peoples.â I was about half a second away from saying âyou have called us from apples.â,220,41,12:19:01
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,12:12:18
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah salmon sounds great!,28,5,9:14:32
Erica Yee,Do you guys like salmon?,24,5,0:46:31
Erica Yee,Sleep well!,11,2,0:26:11
Ben Fickes,Thatâs also what I thought but donât know how to communicate that to my mom haha. Okay sounds good! Going to bed now goodnight,130,24,0:24:58
Erica Yee,But thanks and I will :),24,6,0:24:13
Erica Yee,Lol honestly think they're fine with us holding hands,53,9,0:24:03
Ben Fickes,So before I forget my mom just told me âwatch the amount of PDA you show to Erica while weâre in Oakland. It might be upsetting for her parents if you hold her hand in front of them.â So I was not really planning on going overboard on PDA but please let me know if whatever level is too much haha,302,61,0:17:35
Erica Yee,Nice haha,9,2,0:17:27
Ben Fickes,Nice and short haha,19,4,0:15:22
Erica Yee,Yay how was it,14,4,0:08:12
Ben Fickes,Landed in philly,16,3,23:13:45
Ben Fickes,Thanks hope you have a good dinner!,35,7,21:01:16
Erica Yee,Ok grandparents here for dinner have a good flight,50,9,20:56:24
Erica Yee,Omg lol,7,2,20:56:13
Ben Fickes,And unrelated but Josh just told me he made plans to see a movie with friends Thursday night ugh but oh well glad heâs enjoying time with them,144,28,20:44:47
Ben Fickes,Iâm at my gate,16,4,20:44:10
Ben Fickes,Okay gotcha. Yeah I understand you haha. Glad youâre doing alright now but itâs alright if youâre not or arenât later,125,21,20:43:56
Erica Yee,but think you understand me haha,32,6,20:28:32
Erica Yee,at least that's what i try to tell myself,41,9,20:28:26
Erica Yee,not that being emotional equates not being ok lol,49,9,20:28:20
Erica Yee,i was a bit emotional while it was happening but i'm alright now,64,13,20:28:07
Ben Fickes,Oh wow. Thanks for sharing that. Are you alright?,49,9,19:37:58
Erica Yee,But glad I got to see her,25,7,19:35:01
Erica Yee,Meeting with my popo was kinda weird. At first she was happy to see us then after my mom explained who Diana was we couldn't tell if she understood and then she wanted us to leave (which doesn't usually happen),210,40,19:34:53
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,19:33:39
Ben Fickes,Always a fatal disease haha. And oh my goodness haha wow that sounds like quite the Costco adventure,100,18,17:19:14
Erica Yee,Omg so we're at Costco and my mom had to run in to get meds before the pharmacy closed so I had to drive to find parking but my mom took the key in her purse so I just roamed around the parking lot with the car beeping at me. Thank goodness it still ran. Then ended up taking the space of a former Sunday school teacher haha. Didn't say hi though,346,72,16:58:58
Erica Yee,Just a generic contemporary one. The author is a really good writer BUT she always puts in a fatal disease out of nowhere as a plot twist,137,27,16:54:55
Ben Fickes,Which trash romance?,20,3,16:21:02
Ben Fickes,Yeah I might do that too but I am slightly worried about getting my work done haha,82,17,16:20:55
Erica Yee,I did nothing that required even a little bit of thinking on the plane. Just watched movies and read a trash romance instead of the scifi or Chichi's book hahaha,161,30,16:19:34
Ben Fickes,Me too. Thanks haha. Itâs a very short flight though so I might just work and then sleep well tonight haha,108,21,16:18:00
Erica Yee,Aww. Hope you can rest today and on the flight,46,10,16:17:06
Ben Fickes,I feel so tired today haha,26,6,16:13:07
Ben Fickes,Around 9:30,11,2,16:12:55
Erica Yee,When's your flight?,19,3,16:12:32
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,16:12:27
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness I canât wait to hear about her. And I hope you all have a good time with your grandma. I hope itâs not too hard on you if sheâs not doing well when you visit,178,38,16:09:24
Erica Yee,"Her, my mom and I are going to see my mom's adopted mom now. Gonna be interesting lol. Not sure her reaction but also she has pretty bad dementia so who knows what she'll be like anyway",185,37,15:45:36
Erica Yee,I don't even know how to explain. But extremely into the enneagram lmao,71,13,15:41:55
Erica Yee,She's fascinating omg,21,3,15:41:32
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness! How was it? And thanks :),41,9,14:28:24
Erica Yee,"Also saw your snap, have fun playing!",37,7,14:08:06
Erica Yee,I met my grandmother ð® she was reading the new York times hahaha,67,13,14:07:50
Ben Fickes,Oh dang well glad you got to rest some! I saw the pork bone haha,64,15,13:55:23
Erica Yee,Just woke up which is so late eastern time but I didn't go to bed till 12am Pacific cuz we had second dinner lol,112,24,13:33:37
Erica Yee,Ohh ok. Yeah agreed haha,24,5,13:30:56
Ben Fickes,"No second one, I saw the first one a while ago",46,11,10:06:18
Erica Yee,First one??,11,2,1:17:39
Ben Fickes,Wreck it Ralph was good but made me a little sad haha,53,12,0:15:25
Ben Fickes,Goodnight! Safe flight!,23,3,23:14:14
Erica Yee,"Ok we're taking off, good night :)",34,7,23:14:00
Erica Yee,Yep it's good. I have a small list of rom coms that are legit good imo in the back of my head and that is on it haha,116,28,23:13:08
Ben Fickes,No problem! Was it good? And  cool thanks for sharing! If you would be interested we can watch it sometime haha,111,21,23:12:08
Erica Yee,Very feel good and witty movie,30,6,23:10:55
Erica Yee,It's about this woman who loves weddings and has been a bridesmaid in 27 of them,80,16,23:10:38
Erica Yee,"I did eat, thanks for asking :)",31,7,23:10:11
Ben Fickes,Oh did you eat?,15,4,23:09:06
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Have never seen it whatâs it about? And yeah I agree with that. Safe second part of your flight?,107,21,23:09:02
Erica Yee,Taking off v soon then it's an hour and a half to SF,52,13,23:08:44
Erica Yee,Yeah I would say I liked it. Honestly the main characters were more likable than the Harry Potter ones lol,106,20,23:08:35
Erica Yee,Then I rewatched 27 dresses which is a legit good rom com haha,62,13,23:08:02
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad you donât have a headache! How long is the rest of the flight? And glad you liked it (or if you didnât it was better than you expected haha),155,31,23:07:55
Erica Yee,"Oh I watched fantastic beasts! Honestly better than I was expecting. Thought the story and characters were really good, though a bit too dark for my tastes and the creatures themselves were meh",193,33,23:07:24
Erica Yee,But it's been alright and don't have a headache as of right now haha yay,72,15,23:06:41
Erica Yee,"Not great honestly, it's pretty bumpy (wind is why we need refueling)",69,12,23:06:22
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling after this much flying?,43,8,23:05:14
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha I canât believe that thatâs hilarious. And yeah she made it without my input haha,105,19,23:04:59
Erica Yee,"My former cs partner sent me this, thought you would find it funny",66,13,22:46:50
Erica Yee,Just landed in Utah,19,4,22:46:32
Erica Yee,Hmm I kinda see it but I feel like the hair is not exactly right haha,69,16,22:46:26
Erica Yee,Ooh lemme see,13,3,22:46:08
Ben Fickes,Rachel made me a Bitmoji haha,29,6,22:23:27
Erica Yee,Aw yay! Ok ttyl,15,4,16:46:35
Ben Fickes,Also Iâm going to the gym with Danny :),41,9,16:45:52
Ben Fickes,I might be haha ð I hope you travel safely!,46,10,16:45:41
Erica Yee,Actually you probably will be huh lol,37,7,16:45:30
Erica Yee,"Ok taking off soon, getting in around midnight eastern so not sure if you'll be up",82,16,16:45:25
Ben Fickes,Dang you keep lucking out on these rows,39,8,16:45:19
Erica Yee,Flight was supposedly full but I have the entire back row to myself lol,71,14,16:44:00
Erica Yee,Aww sweet,9,2,16:27:18
Ben Fickes,I just got off the phone with my mom and she asked about you haha,65,15,16:24:44
Ben Fickes,Oh wow well hope it doesnât delay your flight too much,56,11,16:24:22
Erica Yee,Apparently just stopping there for refueling lol,48,7,16:22:22
Erica Yee,We all got a notification that our flight was going to salt lake City and everyone's like WHAT,94,18,16:22:07
Erica Yee,Omg hahaha thanks xD,20,4,16:12:18
Ben Fickes,"Oh my goodness. You must be starving. Hope the food is good, youâll have to let me know. I can watch for your plane and just throw food up into the sky and you can lean out the window and catch it",198,42,16:09:24
Erica Yee,So I made some poor life choices this afternoon. The last time I ate was 9:30 lol cuz I didn't have time to eat lunch. I thought I could get food after security but of course I happen to be at a gate that only has vending machine-like options (but full service bar lol). So think I'm gonna order airplane food once I get on for the first time,342,69,16:01:47
Erica Yee,I'm at the gate now,19,5,15:59:32
Erica Yee,Good job! :),12,3,15:59:27
Ben Fickes,Finished my exam and it went well. Safe flight!,47,9,15:52:17
Ben Fickes,Enjoy your last hour before then haha. Thanks!,46,8,13:50:19
Erica Yee,And yay I'm glad!,17,4,13:49:48
Erica Yee,Probably around 3,17,3,13:49:41
Ben Fickes,"Also, I gave my Game Social Justice presentation and it went well!",66,12,13:14:52
Ben Fickes,Awesome! Congrats :) when are you heading to the airport?,57,10,13:14:35
Erica Yee,and i submitted my midterm!,27,5,11:52:37
Erica Yee,very nice commute haha,22,4,11:52:27
Erica Yee,omg that's great!! hope she gets it,35,7,11:52:15
Erica Yee,"no not at all, it just totally slipped my mind cuz i didn't put it in my calendar",81,18,11:52:04
Ben Fickes,Also your snap reminded me that Molly interviewed for the Boston Globe for her next co op!,90,17,11:01:50
Ben Fickes,Oh dang sorry if it was in any part due to me,45,12,11:01:28
Erica Yee,i just realized i didn't do a nu sci newsletter like i usually do on the first of each month lol whoops,103,22,10:46:00
Erica Yee,thanks :),9,2,10:45:42
Ben Fickes,"Okay haha I hope today can be pretty lowkey for you. And I'll probably have a chance to wish you a safe flight later but if not, have a safe flight haha",152,32,10:20:32
Erica Yee,A lot better after I showered haha,34,7,10:17:46
Ben Fickes,Ugh I'm so sorry. How are you feeling?,38,8,10:06:42
Erica Yee,Same actually except that there's people fixing the fire escapes so got woken up by loud banging lol,100,18,10:04:45
Ben Fickes,Pretty well. Actually took me a little bit to fall asleep but I got probably like 7 hours. How about you?,105,21,9:58:19
Erica Yee,Did you sleep ok?,17,4,9:54:56
Erica Yee,Yepp,4,1,9:54:06
Ben Fickes,HAHA well at least it clears up toward the end?,47,10,9:48:14

Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. I'm glad you got to listen to others share and that they felt comfortable sharing. And gotcha hope you can at least sleep well. And however much it is, in less than 48 hours you'll be on a plane home",207,41,21:41:20
Erica Yee,Thanks for asking,17,3,21:39:56
Erica Yee,My stress is still elevated lol but at least my body seemed to be fine today,76,16,21:39:53
Erica Yee,"It was good. Everyone else shared very in depth which I felt honored to hear. I shared a bit but felt like didn't really ""need"" to tonight since I had good sharing opportunities in other settings this week",205,38,21:39:35
Erica Yee,Oh interesting,14,2,21:37:42
Ben Fickes,Was sharing good? Also how are you feeling stress wise?,55,10,21:24:30
Ben Fickes,"It was me Dara and Jason. We actually had really good discussion. It was on the passage about turning the other cheek and ""if someone takes your coat, give them your shirt also."" We talked about enabling and how it fits in if you see someone mistreating others",260,48,21:24:15
Erica Yee,How was men's group?,20,4,21:23:01
Erica Yee,There were only 5 of us and we spent the first hour sharing lol,63,14,21:22:50

Erica Yee,python still driving me crazy now lol,37,7,17:30:02
Erica Yee,"it was fine, the prof forgot to print out copies of our quiz so he just projected it and we struggled to write our answers down lol",131,27,17:29:46
Ben Fickes,How was class?,14,3,17:21:25
Erica Yee,yeah ofc!,9,2,17:09:53
Ben Fickes,Thanks for caring and asking about all of this,46,9,17:07:31
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think it will be. So I think things will all be okay :),62,15,17:07:18

Erica Yee,oh dang ok,10,3,17:06:37

Erica Yee,And that it's finally out of your life?,39,8,16:47:46
Erica Yee,Aw yay glad it was ok,21,6,16:47:35
Ben Fickes,"Talked with my professor. Can tell you more when I see you but it went decent, mostly Iâm glad itâs over haha",113,22,16:46:29
Erica Yee,Here!,5,1,12:35:40
Erica Yee,ooh yeah :P,11,3,22:16:28
Ben Fickes,We can say we've walked both the Brooklyn bridge and golden gate bridge together haha,85,15,22:06:00
Ben Fickes,Oh that sounds awesome!,23,4,22:05:38
Erica Yee,also my dad suggested walking on the golden gate bridge if the weather cooperates which would be cool,101,18,22:03:41
Erica Yee,quesadillas are perfect :),26,4,22:03:10
Ben Fickes,Are quesadillas okay? I know you had Qdoba today...,51,9,21:46:30

Ben Fickes,"And maybe we have a stack of things to talk about, I guess weâll find out",75,16,21:24:21
Ben Fickes,"Sorry to hear about your headache, I hope it goes away completely soon",70,13,21:24:04
Ben Fickes,By any chance I would! Just lemme know whenever youâd like them ð,70,13,21:23:50
Erica Yee,actually would you have extra leftovers for tomorrow lunch by any chance?,73,12,21:19:04
Erica Yee,also started getting a smaller headache during class ugh but took meds and it's getting better now,98,17,21:15:46
Erica Yee,thank you! i appreciate. but did get qdoba during class break (which was such a good idea. so glad my classmate peer pressured me into it). would've been starving if not,169,31,21:15:22
Erica Yee,we have a queue of things to talk about haha,44,10,21:14:46
Ben Fickes,"Also if it is helpful, I have leftovers I can bring you at any time if it would help you to not cook. I know realistically it may be more hassle to try to manage the logistics of stopping by so no worries if youâd rather just cook for yourself. But if it does help lemme know and Iâll get them to you",304,63,20:51:13
Ben Fickes,"I know it was actually really sweet, Iâll tell you about it whenever I see you next",85,17,20:50:08
Erica Yee,LOL aw abby,11,3,20:21:39
Ben Fickes,Dara already knew and tried to convince Dan that he heard it from him. It almost worked,87,17,19:44:12
Ben Fickes,Abby Kraines found out and was overjoyed,40,7,19:43:49
Ben Fickes,Talked about us to some people at IV haha,41,9,19:43:37
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Glad it gives you a little more time,45,10,19:43:26
Erica Yee,Yesss nu sci meeting got cancelled,34,6,19:03:28
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,17:25:30
Ben Fickes,Okay haha. If I can help with anything let me know. Also if you canât meet up Thursday anymore thatâs okay too,114,22,16:54:40
Erica Yee,Actually to be perfectly honest idk how I can get it all done with regular sleep but will have to try ð¬,106,22,16:54:01
Ben Fickes,Okay I'm glad :),16,4,16:47:12
Erica Yee,"Thanks, should be ok hopefully haha",35,6,16:41:13
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. I'm sorry you have even more work,41,8,16:30:45
Erica Yee,"It's for the final project, so will be helpful in the long run but will actually take work to do",96,20,16:30:18
Ben Fickes,How bad is it,13,4,16:21:44
Ben Fickes,dang that's terrible I'm sorry,30,5,16:21:39
Erica Yee,Bostonography just added a new assignment due Thursday in class lol rip,71,12,16:20:07
Ben Fickes,Yeah hopefully it's better tomorrow,35,5,16:18:46
Erica Yee,"Oh man, can't imagine running in this wind",42,8,16:17:31
Ben Fickes,Pretty good! Woke up early to run and the wind made it really difficult. Little tired because I stayed up late writing but overall things are pretty good,153,28,14:51:50
Erica Yee,How's your day going?,21,4,14:50:47
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,14:50:38
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Good luck and hope your work goes well,46,9,14:47:55
Erica Yee,Holing up in Snell till coding class so I can bang stuff out,60,13,14:41:12
Erica Yee,Not bad,7,2,14:40:48
Ben Fickes,How's your day been so far?,27,6,14:18:41
Ben Fickes,btw had another psych experiment today,38,6,14:18:31
Erica Yee,I'm glad :),11,3,14:14:36
Ben Fickes,Okay haha well definitely am looking forward to it! I'm sure my mom is too haha,79,16,14:07:20
Erica Yee,Yep you would think I would know more from just hearing him but he just tells it all so much better haha,104,22,14:06:04
Ben Fickes,HAHA now I'm really excited to hear about it all because I'm curious to hear your dad talk about it. And that's hilarious idk why but for some reason I can pretty clearly imagine your dad lecturing for three hours,213,40,13:57:00
Erica Yee,"Literally one time my mom was like to me ""I keep telling him he needs to give his students a break during a 3 hour class because he would happily just lecture straight through the entire time""",192,37,13:54:56
Erica Yee,If you think I like explaining things a lot..,45,9,13:54:01
Erica Yee,Omg you're gonna get sick of it lol,35,8,13:53:54
Ben Fickes,I can't imagine your dad explaining everything but I think it's mostly because I've never really talked to him much haha,120,21,13:50:41
Erica Yee,My dad is the ultimate Oakland tour guide (and my mom won't be free till evening I think) lol,93,19,13:49:36
Ben Fickes,Sounds good :) looking forward to visiting!,43,7,13:42:11
Erica Yee,"The SF touristy stuff can be fun if your mom wants to see it, but it'll take up a lot of time",93,22,13:40:34
Erica Yee,Yeah that makes sense haha. In that case we'll probably stay in Oakland/ east bay,81,15,13:39:53
Ben Fickes,And oh I haven't seen her in a while,36,9,13:38:25
Ben Fickes,"As for SF, I'll ask my mom. I'd say for me that my highest priority is to get to see whatever is part of ""your home"" that you want to show if that makes any sense at all, so whatever stuff you want to do I'm down for",216,48,13:38:15
Erica Yee,And saw Alison hu for a bit,27,7,13:38:03
Erica Yee,Moreton,7,1,13:37:59
Ben Fickes,"Wait Abby Kraines or Moreton? And ooh that sounds really cool. ""Dragons and word count"" feels like you just gave me a headline haha",131,24,13:37:03
Erica Yee,Also also remind me to tell you about this podcast interview with a fantasy author I'm listening to. About dragons and word count,129,23,13:02:31
Erica Yee,Also I'm supposed to ask what the main sights you and your mom want to see. Do you want to go to SF?,100,23,12:59:06
Erica Yee,"Except awkwardly didn't know how to say our how our relationship is going besides ""good"" lol",92,16,12:58:36
Erica Yee,Had a really nice talk with Abby,32,7,12:58:18
Ben Fickes,Night :),8,2,23:17:57
Erica Yee,Good night!,11,2,23:17:45
Erica Yee,Cool thanks,11,2,23:17:41
Ben Fickes,And thanks :),13,3,23:15:01
Ben Fickes,"Okay, that sounds great :) looking forward to it. But again no pressure if your project gets last minute",104,19,23:14:58
Erica Yee,I do want to see and talk to you too,36,10,23:14:47
Erica Yee,"And even if it isn't, after that",32,7,23:14:20
Erica Yee,Thursday night probably? Nu sci meeting may get cancelled,57,9,23:14:14
Ben Fickes,Nah I donât think sheâs talking about me,44,8,23:13:42
Erica Yee,"Well exact words asked for ""Been&mom's"" but I'm making my best educated guess",77,13,23:13:10
Ben Fickes,"Iâll see if I can find it, my mom might have it and sheâs driving home now",78,17,23:13:04
Ben Fickes,Also really do not want to stress you out but if you have the time could I talk to you at least once before break? Have thoughts about my lunch and also to hear about your moms reunion and also to just see you. But donât want to stress you out so no worries if you canât,274,57,23:12:50
Erica Yee,My mom wants me to ask for your guys' flight info,49,11,23:12:29
Ben Fickes,Well glad itâs people you know!,33,6,23:11:57
Erica Yee,"And np, I am going to bed soon but was journaling",49,11,23:11:38
Erica Yee,Yeah it's all people I've known before actually. But they have serious senioritis lol,85,14,23:11:12
Ben Fickes,Also I know you have to get up early tomorrow so if you need to go to bed donât let me keep you up,100,24,23:10:07
Ben Fickes,Haha ð well at least youâre getting a relatively early start then. Is your group good?,91,16,23:09:46
Erica Yee,No sorry I just like to do homework slightly before the deadline haha,69,13,23:09:06
Erica Yee,"I asked my group a question about the project and one of them was like ""omg is it due tomorrow""",95,20,23:08:43
Ben Fickes,Oh yeah I did tell you haha,27,7,23:07:59
Erica Yee,Yeah and get really competitive?,32,5,23:07:44
Ben Fickes,Did I mention to you that Thiago and Joshua love playing that game together,75,14,23:01:36
Erica Yee,I'll watch you guys play haha,29,6,23:01:08
Ben Fickes,Oh wait I only have two remotes dang,36,8,22:59:10
Ben Fickes,Dang sometime in an alternate world where we all have free time we should play again with Barbs,95,18,22:59:02
Erica Yee,Oh yeah I only realized a while into playing where you could see the orders too xD,82,17,22:56:55
Ben Fickes,HAHA John and I were rushing to get a recipe out  at the end and barely didnât get it done. Then I was like âwait no one ordered thatâ,140,29,22:55:36
Erica Yee,without looking at the recipes hahaha,37,6,22:54:18
Erica Yee,umm no i would just pick one task i could figure out how to do and do it repetitively,85,19,22:54:04
Ben Fickes,Nah you were pretty good I think,32,7,22:50:42
Erica Yee,HAHA same though,16,3,22:38:38
Ben Fickes,Also between the two of us John is pretty bad at Overcooked haha,64,13,22:34:07
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,22:33:54
Erica Yee,that's amazing :) glad you get time to chill,44,9,22:31:51
Erica Yee,yeah,4,1,22:31:21
Ben Fickes,I actually feel pretty not stressed because I finished GSJ pretty early and now all I have before break is Psych on Friday. But it feels suspicious that I have free time so I just have the vague unease haha. Got to write some and gamed a little with John,254,50,22:29:58
Ben Fickes,The one where you got the sources late? And that's good. How are you feeling stress wise?,89,17,22:28:50
Erica Yee,how's your evening been?,24,4,22:28:31

Erica Yee,Reunion was small but actually really good and encouraging,58,9,20:51:20
Erica Yee,Thanks ð,11,2,20:51:07
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs really good. I know I say this a lot but I admire your ability to listen, Iâm sure it helped him. And thanks :) oh thatâs really nice! Glad you got to write it",172,35,18:11:49
Erica Yee,Oh also I'm getting paid extra for the hackbeanpot article because it took more time than usual! Really glad about that,119,21,18:11:21
Erica Yee,Hope your work goees well!,26,5,18:10:52
Erica Yee,He's ok. I got to ask him some tough questions that I've been wanting. But mostly just got to listen,100,20,18:09:59
Ben Fickes,Is he doing better? And dw Iâm just starting hw now too. Glad research got pushed back!,89,17,18:04:47
Erica Yee,"On the bright side, research hw got pushed back to Friday",57,11,18:04:02
Erica Yee,And then before I met up with Victor I talked on the phone with Calvin again which was really good but also we're at 0 homework done today yet lmao,147,30,18:03:43
Ben Fickes,Oh dang. Well I hope it stays stopped. Sorry that happened to you,65,13,18:03:07
Erica Yee,Hopefully alright? It stopped and then we ran to the bus stop in this terrible wind (which is what set the second one off in the first place) and seems stable now hopefully,172,33,18:02:34
Ben Fickes,You caught my sickness but apparently your body thinks blood is mucus. And oh wow dang glad he could help though,112,21,18:02:18
Erica Yee,And Victor had the privilege of helping clean up my literal bloodstains lol,75,13,18:01:48
Erica Yee,Tmi but there was blood gushing out of both nostrils,52,10,18:01:29

Erica Yee,"yay ok, and sounds good",23,5,16:51:04
Ben Fickes,Issue got fixed! I might. So I havenât got the feedback portion I get that tonight. Iâm going to see the breakdown of what I lost points for and see if I can argue off of that,179,37,16:45:37
Erica Yee,Ah ok. I'm glad then! Are you gonna talk to your professor about it? you did so much of the work..,98,21,16:32:34

Erica Yee,"Then she mentioned her new project is on quantifying memes, and I watched all the CS boys fall in love lol",106,21,13:44:13

Ben Fickes,Oh also I finished systems and I think I'm gonna try Apex Legends later,71,14,20:30:40
Ben Fickes,Haha maybe juicy gossip will entice him to come,47,9,20:30:26
Erica Yee,And that's what he gets for not coming to IV stuff,50,11,20:29:58
Ben Fickes,HAHA oh my that's embarassing,29,5,20:29:57
Erica Yee,"Idk, once when emceeing he said Kara's name incorrectly when she was up there too. So I don't put much faith in his memory",122,24,20:29:44
Ben Fickes,Even though apparently everyone else saw it coming haha,55,9,20:29:05
Ben Fickes,Or maybe it is just reconciling us,34,7,20:28:55
Ben Fickes,Wait Pat doesn't remember me? Am not offended but a little surprised he doesn't remember me haha,96,17,20:28:40
Erica Yee,Or maybe reconcile us together haha,35,6,20:27:58
Erica Yee,I told him we were dating and he said congrats but low-key think he had to remember who you are at first,104,22,20:27:45
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,20:27:16
Erica Yee,Idk but they started dating in London,37,7,20:27:08

Erica Yee,What are you wearing??,22,4,19:10:23
Erica Yee,So corner is good,17,4,19:10:19

Ben Fickes,Haha ð I was thinking about that. I think my mom knows itâs too late for you to think Iâm fancy,102,21,21:08:57
Erica Yee,Hahaha are you allowed to eat pasta in front of me now,54,12,21:05:15
Erica Yee,"Yeah that makes sense, thanks :)",32,6,21:04:57
Ben Fickes,"I sent it to my mom and she replied with ""That's my boy!""",57,13,20:56:00
Ben Fickes,Should've sent that to your grandmother,39,6,20:53:14
Ben Fickes,Also probably laughed at the burger pic for a solid thirty seconds,66,12,20:52:58
Ben Fickes,No it's all good haha really! We will have more time together and I would rather you be how you feel than pretending to be otherwise if that makes sense?,153,30,20:52:43

Ben Fickes,Haha I'm glad :),16,4,21:58:31
Erica Yee,*truthful LOL*,14,2,21:53:43

Erica Yee,Hahaha you can stick with your puns,35,7,21:47:29
Ben Fickes,Dang Sophie is stealing all my good romantic lines,50,9,21:46:00

Erica Yee,Sorry thanks for listening haha,31,5,21:37:21
Erica Yee,But she got a freaking 90 which was above average of course so yay very happy for her xD,88,19,21:37:15
Erica Yee,She had me click on it and give a thumbs up if she passed (73) or a thumbs down if not cuz she thought she got like a 50 or something,133,31,21:36:38
Erica Yee,Omg the grades just came out for the big pharm test Sophie was freaking out over and she didn't want to look without alcohol but I was like just get it over with,161,33,21:35:06
Erica Yee,If you guys are in West then that would be amazing haha,55,12,21:34:30

Ben Fickes,Huh thanks for sharing that. Amy is here rn having dinner with Matt but Iâll let him know later about dbo,107,21,21:28:27
Erica Yee,Raytheon is great for resume but I remember dbo didn't enjoy her co-op there (idk why though),93,17,21:27:41
Erica Yee,Oh wow ok,9,3,21:26:56
Ben Fickes,"It's a 20 minute walk from DP. His top choice is Raytheon which he has an interview on Friday for, but he's thinking about taking it because the offer expires on Friday",168,32,21:20:57
Erica Yee,Slash is he taking it,21,5,21:19:26

Ben Fickes,"Gotcha haha. It was good! I think Jason did a really good job leading it, and Chris seemed engaged. He canât make any more he said though which is sad",152,30,20:56:33
Erica Yee,How was men's group? What did Chris think?,42,8,20:45:25
Erica Yee,Yep. Might renege on the nu sci article for this issue but that's a tomorrow problem lol,88,17,20:45:18
Ben Fickes,Congrats! Glad you got it all done and hope youâre feeling less stressed,74,13,20:38:21
Erica Yee,But I finished! Still need to fact check and stuff but bulk of work is done,75,16,20:11:30

Ben Fickes,Are you going to enc tonight or skipping?,41,8,18:39:29

Ben Fickes,Just received this message,26,4,18:03:37
Erica Yee,exactly,7,1,15:09:08
Ben Fickes,HAHA just blame your lack of correlation on your prof,53,10,15:05:44

Erica Yee,You guys are trying for West right?,35,7,13:42:03
Erica Yee,Yep and don't know them,23,5,13:41:53
Ben Fickes,For housing next year? Thatâs great! An RA you know or not?,61,12,12:56:46
Erica Yee,Very happy and relieved this is over lol,40,8,12:56:09
Erica Yee,We're gonna be in Willis with an RA,35,8,12:55:57
Ben Fickes,Haha ð indeed,16,3,10:37:41
Erica Yee,Reverse psychology xD,21,3,10:26:12
Ben Fickes,I told him that too but we laughed when he said he was good at keeping secrets so now I think heâs trying to prove a point,124,27,10:24:56
Erica Yee,Honestly don't think it's gossiping but I appreciate that haha,62,10,10:08:35
Ben Fickes,They both said they wanted to avoid telling people as a way of avoiding gossiping (which I was very proud of Dan for). But weâll see haha. And apparently weâre very obvious,176,32,9:57:26
Ben Fickes,Haha indeed,11,2,9:56:31
Erica Yee,And so it begins,16,4,8:38:57
Erica Yee,lmaoooo,7,1,8:38:52
Ben Fickes,"Oh and it was sparked when Joshua asked âwho are you investing in, Ben?â (Totally loaded question haha)",107,18,0:22:07
Ben Fickes,But Dan wanted a play by play of everything that happened. And I have a very funny about Joshua and a calendar to tell you,122,25,0:05:10
Ben Fickes,They were not surprised in the slightest haha,45,8,0:04:39
Ben Fickes,Matt went to sleep but I just told Dan and Joshua,49,11,0:04:21
Erica Yee,ah ok i'm glad,14,4,22:01:08
Ben Fickes,Talked to him a lot about us (me and you not me and him haha) and the game engine project,89,20,21:55:06
Ben Fickes,I did earlier,13,3,21:54:38
Erica Yee,are you getting the chance to catch up with jason?,50,10,21:54:23
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:54:16
Ben Fickes,"They are scattered about so if the opportunity arises I will tell them, if not I'll tell them soon haha",103,20,21:48:57
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good haha,21,4,21:48:33
Erica Yee,after i told vivian i feel like it's only a matter of time now until all of iv knows anyway,91,20,21:48:09
Erica Yee,lol you can tell them now if you want,37,9,21:47:48
Ben Fickes,Also can talk to you in person whenever I see you next but have a vague feeling that I would like to tell Dan and Matt about us sometime. But we can talk about it because I know that's essentially the same as everyone knowing haha,230,46,21:47:14
Ben Fickes,Cool cool cool. Good luck with all the writing haha,51,10,21:46:25
Erica Yee,should be fine. the fair is at 6,32,8,21:45:24
Erica Yee,though the ccis freelancing is marketing not journalism,55,8,21:45:19
Erica Yee,it's actually probs for the better this semester since none of my classes are straight reporting,96,16,21:45:05
Ben Fickes,Are you still good for BB with publication fair or will it conflict?,68,13,21:44:18
Ben Fickes,Dang I can't believe all the writing outside of class you do. That's cool about nu sci! But not that you have to write so soon haha,131,27,21:44:05
Erica Yee,though that reminds me i have to write my nu sci article by thursday too yikes,78,16,21:43:55
Erica Yee,yeah hackbeanpot is for khoury* haha. i occasionally freelance for them,71,11,21:43:24
Erica Yee,also i just found out that nu sci is hosting a publication fair before our meeting on thursday that i probably have to go to. sounds actually cool though,153,29,21:43:09
Ben Fickes,*Khoury,7,1,21:42:56
Ben Fickes,Oh it's for ccis not nu sci?,28,7,21:42:47
Erica Yee,but we'll see,13,3,21:42:36
Erica Yee,the next ccis newsletter has to get finalized this week so probably not,71,13,21:42:26
Ben Fickes,OH wow... would they let you have an extension? Do you think it'll take a lot of time?,86,18,21:40:38
Erica Yee,and it's technically due tomorrow haha,38,6,21:39:51
Erica Yee,ugh i might skip enc tomorrow to write the hackbeanpot article cuz some of the organizers finally got back to me today but i really don't feel like writing it rn,161,31,21:39:43
Erica Yee,lol fake news,13,3,21:39:00
Ben Fickes,And wow wonder why you have so much pork haha,45,10,21:38:03
Ben Fickes,But it has a health score of 73 fwiw,36,9,21:37:41
Ben Fickes,And Jason is claiming that maybe a website does not have the right to objectively decide which foods are healthiest,115,20,21:37:32
Ben Fickes,Because Dan is claiming that it is objectively the eigth healthiest food because it was ranked eigth on a website,113,20,21:37:01
Erica Yee,haha i just ate pork,20,5,21:36:49
Ben Fickes,About pork fat,14,3,21:36:35
Ben Fickes,Dan is now debating with Jason,30,6,21:36:32
Ben Fickes,Yes. Dan is eating dinner while I work,38,8,21:36:01
Erica Yee,are you still at dp?,20,5,21:35:52
Erica Yee,LOL what,8,2,21:35:50
Ben Fickes,Dan: did you know that pork fat is the 8th healthiest food to eat?,66,14,21:35:24
Ben Fickes,"Wow sounds like you got a lot done today, way to go! And glad about that too, hope you are free from headaches for a bit now. I'm good, felt really rested for some reason when I woke up but now am lacking motivation to work haha. But work I shall",246,51,21:34:22
Erica Yee,you?,4,1,21:32:26
Erica Yee,and my period is ending so i'm feeling better physically haha and think i escaped further headaches yay,103,18,21:31:51
Erica Yee,"though when i tried to convert directly to pdf so i could submit it, it didn't work, which is why i had to convert to latex then from that to pdf lol",149,32,21:31:16
Erica Yee,i'm doing good though. spent all afternoon working on the questionnaire assignment and actually managed to do it completely in a jupyter notebook! so really happy about that,173,28,21:30:52
Ben Fickes,Outside of sugar how are you doing?,35,7,21:30:20
Erica Yee,"LOL that does make me feel better, thanks x)",44,9,21:29:55
Ben Fickes,And ate a PBJ before IV,23,6,21:29:41
Ben Fickes,If it makes you feel better I had five cookies at IV and then went to Amelia's with Jason,89,19,21:29:23
Ben Fickes,Oh dang haha well gotta enjoy them while you're there. And wow dang sounds like you were livin the life,103,20,21:29:07
Erica Yee,"but she doesn't like dark, so she gave a bunch to me and i just kept popping them",81,18,21:28:43
Erica Yee,jasmine came directly from new york again and so she had all the valentine's candy from sean,92,17,21:28:29

I will explain more generally what helps me in person because Iâm tired and canât phrase my words haha,303,58,0:12:41
Erica Yee,And you're very welcome,23,4,0:10:46
Erica Yee,Hmm I guess let me know if you don't want to talk about something? And I'm totally ok with being together without talking (about something specific or in general). But also understand if you want alone time,206,37,0:10:27
Ben Fickes,"But seriously, thank you. I really appreciate how much you care and are there for me. Thank you",95,18,0:08:06
Ben Fickes,Well if youâre ever in the mood for some really bad essays not founded in fact lemme know ð,96,19,0:07:47
Erica Yee,I wish I could program well enough to rescue you from your assignments haha,75,14,0:07:17
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I was actually guessing that was your thought process haha. Thank you Erica ð I will give it some thought but will try to communicate ahead of time I guess what would be most helpful for me in most of these situations? Just so it doesnât put you in a bind. But also itâs not on you to ârescueâ me from all my issues haha, just donât want you to feel pressure :)",379,74,0:05:31
Erica Yee,But also didn't want to seem like I didn't care how it went for you cuz I do,76,18,23:58:11
Erica Yee,Aw thanks for telling me this. I want to be there for you when you need to complain or vent or whatever. But honestly I was kinda worried that me asking you about (like in person at Snell) made you unnecessarily relive it cuz I know you said you wanted to not think about it anymore,282,56,23:57:50
Ben Fickes,"Also I guess I wonât have a chance to tell you this and really want to so Iâll message you now, but wanted to say that Iâm sorry because I was kinda in a bad mood today after the whole game Engine thing, and I was trying to keep it to myself and not put it on you. But I know I mightâve. So... just wanted to say sorry if it negatively impacted you. And if it didnât well idk haha glad it didnât",407,84,23:53:58
Ben Fickes,"Yeah sure, thanks! Iâll be outside your place",47,8,23:51:27
Erica Yee,B and I are walking to ruggles at 945 if you want to join,57,14,23:51:07
Erica Yee,Yeah haha ð,14,3,23:49:55
Ben Fickes,No problem! And awesome! I know I havenât seen them together much but honestly just hearing Jason talk about her makes me know how cute they are together (if that makes sense),177,32,23:45:25
Erica Yee,And Jason and Rachel are so cute omg,36,8,23:39:10
Erica Yee,I'll tell you more tomorrow but it was super fun,48,10,23:38:41
Erica Yee,Sorry was walking back,22,4,23:38:25
Ben Fickes,After dim sum sounds good - I guess since ST goes til 8:30 that probably lines up about right? And wow such willpower haha. How was it? Or you can tell me tomorrow about it too if youâre tired now,198,40,23:21:24
Erica Yee,They started watching clueless which is a movie I like (high school version of Emma) so had to go or else I'd end up staying for the whole thing,144,29,23:20:10
Erica Yee,I'm actually leaving Taylor and Dara's right now haha,53,9,23:19:20
Erica Yee,After dimsum?,13,2,23:19:09
Erica Yee,Lol oh hmm,10,3,23:18:50
Ben Fickes,No need to reply to this now but wanted to say at some point before I go to bed that the pork takes around 7-8 hours to cook (but varies by slow cooker). So when would be best for me to bring it over?,200,44,23:12:19
Ben Fickes,Where on third floor?,21,4,14:34:21
Erica Yee,you're welcome,14,2,14:18:43
Ben Fickes,"Okay haha thanks for sharing, I appreciate it :)",48,9,14:17:21
Erica Yee,oh no! didn't think you were upset. just wanted to say how i view it haha,73,16,14:16:57
Ben Fickes,"No worries haha hope I didnât come off as being upset or anything, I totally understand and I donât even have ig so makes no difference to me haha. And okay Iâll walk over soon",182,35,14:15:00
Erica Yee,yep third floor,15,3,14:14:07
Erica Yee,"also in response to the other thing we were talking about, for some reason i feel weird about putting a picture of you on my ig now we're dating. i had no problem with putting friends incl you on before but now i feel like it's giving away a secret even though it would be the same thing as before lol",301,61,14:13:55
Ben Fickes,"I might stop by, Iâm just about done with lunch",49,10,14:13:24
Ben Fickes,Are you gonna be at Snell until then?,37,8,14:13:11
Ben Fickes,Haha good luck with that,24,5,14:13:03
Erica Yee,ok probably around 5ish. need to coordinate taking the t with jason (hopefully he responds to my message lol),109,19,14:12:42
Ben Fickes,"Oh lemme know how it is! That sounds super cool. And yeah haha of course! And thanks haha I do appreciate it, it will save me having to cook dinner haha",152,31,14:07:14
Erica Yee,cuz i'm going to dara's to watch the game afterward,51,10,14:06:24
Erica Yee,i can drop off the pork at your place before i go since i gotta go back to my apartment anyway,94,21,14:05:44
Erica Yee,thank you for understanding!,28,4,14:05:24
Erica Yee,it's like your group does team challenges together? never been but have friends who really liked it,99,17,14:05:18
Erica Yee,"i told him yes at first because i thought it was tomorrow. but then when i realized it's today, i was like omg wait i already had commitments. but then i do want to spend more time with him and especially see rachel so i was like ah just gonna apologize to my other people",272,55,14:04:16
Ben Fickes,Oh no worries! Whatâs boda borg? I hope you have fun :),57,12,14:04:15
Erica Yee,"OH also very sorry but i'm going to boda borg with ariel, jason, rachel tonight, even though i promised vivian i was going to women's group and you dinner sigh",159,30,14:03:29
Ben Fickes,HAHA I feel like the number of public pics went down as we got closer haha. But okay I guess Vivian is just a super sleuth,122,26,14:02:31
Erica Yee,"yeah apparently i had too many pictures of you on my snap and ig in new york with created suspicion, even though i haven't really had any since we *actually* started dating xD",175,33,14:01:12
Erica Yee,sounds like a plan,18,4,14:00:39
Ben Fickes,Thatâs good! And haha ð yeah I feel like everyone knows and hasnât said anything haha,92,16,14:00:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah. I think if my grade is bad though I might at least ask. The professor is pretty chill and Iâve had him before so I feel like I could at least lay things out and even if he says no itâll be alright. But will probably wait for grade to come out so I can say âI think I deserve more than Xâ,301,64,13:59:49
Erica Yee,"also i told vivian about us even though she didn't ask lol (""i totally saw it!!!"")",82,16,13:58:20
Erica Yee,lunch was really good! glad i got to spend time with them,57,12,13:57:56
Erica Yee,yeah ik you don't like confrontation..,38,6,13:57:38
Ben Fickes,I might talk to my prof idk,27,7,13:57:19
Ben Fickes,Oh I just got back to my place sorry. I gotta eat but maybe Iâll join later if youâre still studying,104,21,13:57:13
Erica Yee,are you still on campus? vivian and i are in snell if you want to study,71,16,13:56:48
Erica Yee,i can't believe you're gonna get the same grade as everyone else. seems so unfair,81,15,13:56:34
Ben Fickes,How was your lunch?,19,4,13:56:25
Ben Fickes,Oh well gonna block it out of my mind until then haha,53,12,13:56:20
Ben Fickes,Yeah. But ugh it wonât be if I get a bad grade because then my mom is gonna ask me about it and Iâll have to tell her everything and sheâll say I should meet with my professor and state why I deserve a better grade,220,46,13:56:07
Erica Yee,"sorry you had to do so much work, especially this :/ but glad it's over with",76,16,13:50:07
Erica Yee,oh dang,7,2,13:49:33
Ben Fickes,Also his recommendation for the next project was âdonât use windowsâ,74,11,13:36:54
Ben Fickes,Just finished office hours. The guy was really nice which honestly helps a lot. But he pointed out several different bugs and asked a lot of questions about the code. I did actually point out a conscious reason I chose to do something differently from how he suggested which I hope is worth something. Anyways definitely am worried about the grade and would be feeling annoyed at my group members if I didnât feel so done with this haha,438,79,13:36:41
Ben Fickes,No worries haha itâs nice being warm,38,7,10:52:32
Erica Yee,Leaving now sorry,17,3,10:51:54
Erica Yee,Nah come with us,16,4,10:51:51
Ben Fickes,Okay haha is it okay I walk with or do you want me to go separately haha,72,17,10:49:22
Erica Yee,Vivian and chichi are actually walking too lol,46,8,10:48:41
Ben Fickes,Okay haha Iâll meet you at target,35,7,10:44:15
Erica Yee,Sorry gotta go to the bathroom but headijg soon over,52,10,10:44:02
Erica Yee,I'll walk,9,2,10:43:38
Ben Fickes,Do you know if youâre walking back or not?,44,9,10:42:08
Erica Yee,Coming,6,1,8:19:27
Ben Fickes,Here unless youâre at the corner,34,6,8:17:56
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey sounds good!,22,3,14:37:32
Erica Yee,So probably just meet you there,31,6,14:37:12
Erica Yee,"I'm on camoua rn, not sure whether I'm going to go back home or not yet beforehand",82,17,14:37:07
Ben Fickes,Also do you wanna walk over to Marino together later? Know it's not that far haha so no worries if you can't,108,22,14:33:13
Ben Fickes,Will do. Thanks for caring :),29,6,14:14:44
Erica Yee,"ah ok, lemme know how it goes",29,7,13:57:38
Ben Fickes,I am. So I hope I can make it look good. Idk whether to say anything to the prof about my group or not,102,24,13:27:04
Erica Yee,Are you the one showing them?,29,6,12:54:05
Erica Yee,Lol it's definitely ok for that to make you feel better,55,11,12:53:56
Ben Fickes,Itâs okay. Thanks for listening. Apparently other groupsâ games donât build so that makes me feel slightly better? Even though it shouldnât,147,22,12:39:36
Erica Yee,Sorry to hear that â¹ï¸,25,5,12:38:15
Erica Yee,Omg noooo,9,2,12:38:10
Ben Fickes,Ugh I got an email from one of the TAs from Game Engines. He canât build our project and needs one of us to show him it (which is definitely not whatâs supposed to happen...). Ugh sorry just need to vent this stinks,219,43,12:33:23
Ben Fickes,No itâs all good! I feel like we hang out a lot (for some reason) haha. Iâm glad you get to have some time with them :),123,27,12:29:40
Erica Yee,Oh wait I don't want you to feel like I kicked you out of this (even though I kinda just did lol sorry),103,23,12:25:39
Erica Yee,Thanks for being willing to come along again,44,8,12:25:17
Erica Yee,Which should be good,20,4,12:24:39
Erica Yee,Still gonna have a girls lunch with chichi and Vivian Lee tomorrow,66,12,12:24:37
Ben Fickes,I was very confused haha,24,5,12:12:16
Ben Fickes,OH I understand now thank you,29,6,12:12:09
Erica Yee,Without him,11,2,12:11:58
Erica Yee,We're still walking,19,3,12:11:53
Erica Yee,"I think his ""wait what"" is for sweetgteen",41,8,12:11:46
Ben Fickes,Wait Iâm so confused are we walking tonight or not?,53,10,12:11:20
Ben Fickes,Me too!,7,2,11:26:06
Erica Yee,Looking forward to it!,22,4,11:24:21
Ben Fickes,Okay awesome :),15,3,11:14:58
Erica Yee,He said he would get it back to me by tomorrow so hopefully baha,64,14,11:10:00
Erica Yee,After ST,8,2,11:09:32
Erica Yee,And dw Victor is making miso flavored xD,40,8,11:08:39
Erica Yee,Sure that sounds great,22,4,11:08:24
Ben Fickes,Would you want to have dinner Monday before or after ST? Or would you be busy/the slow cooker not be free?,106,21,11:00:38
Ben Fickes,If we can use your slow cooker,30,7,11:00:10
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm glad haha ð hmmm I feel like a copycat but how do you feel about bbq pulled pork? Seems like itâd be pretty easy,128,26,11:00:02
Erica Yee,I definitely like all the chicken we cook though btw haha,57,11,10:58:52
Erica Yee,I don't really cook pork either cuz my mom rarely cooked red meat so hm,71,15,10:57:38
Erica Yee,Thoughtfulness*,15,1,10:56:50
Erica Yee,LOL thank you for your thoughtful,33,6,10:56:43
Ben Fickes,Iâm going to the store and was wondering if you wanted me to get stuff for a pork-based dish for us to cook sometime (since I know you like it but we only really cook chicken which is what I like). If youâre interested is there anything in particular youâd like?,268,51,10:53:52
Ben Fickes,"Oh, speaking of pulled pork, I had an idea",42,9,10:52:16
Ben Fickes,Oh dang hope that works out okay haha,37,8,10:51:57
Erica Yee,Yeah I would prefer next Sunday so we'll see,44,9,10:50:53
Erica Yee,Victor is here to cook and he wanted to come again later to pick up the slow cooker when it's done but no one's gonna be home so I think he's going to find an outlet somewhere? Lol yikes,186,39,10:50:45
Ben Fickes,Next Sunday do you think? Or just sometime next week? And oh my goodness ð¦ I canât even imagine that,105,20,10:49:22
Erica Yee,I'm pretty good. Slept in. Claire came back at 8am and is now sleeping ð®ð®,79,15,10:48:04
Erica Yee,Yeah I said maybe next week,27,6,10:47:20
Ben Fickes,How are you feeling this morning?,33,6,10:45:57
Ben Fickes,"Oh haha oh well. At least you tried, Iâm sure that means a lot to him",71,16,10:45:44
Erica Yee,Sunday lunch cancelled cuz something came up for him lol,56,10,10:45:01
Erica Yee,"Thanks, you too!",16,3,1:54:17
Ben Fickes,Haha Iâm glad ð I already have a couple stories to tell you haha. Thanks for coming over tonight! Really means a lot. Goodnight and I hope you sleep well :),161,31,1:50:03
Erica Yee,Back and still laughing,23,4,1:41:21
Ben Fickes,But Iâm omw,13,3,20:17:54
Ben Fickes,"On my way! We can share a bible or use phone, unless you want to go back for yours",82,19,20:17:50
Erica Yee,But also just realized I forgot my Bible stuff lol,50,10,20:17:26
Erica Yee,Here,4,1,20:17:12
Ben Fickes,"Okay np, take all the time you need",35,8,19:51:03
Erica Yee,Gonna be more like 815,22,5,19:50:36
Ben Fickes,Thank you ð itâs a very nice surprise haha,47,9,19:25:58
Erica Yee,Kk and yay!! Dang you're on a roll,34,8,19:25:38
Ben Fickes,I only have 3 failing tests rn!,31,7,19:23:14
Ben Fickes,8 is def good,13,4,19:23:05
Erica Yee,omg you got me,14,4,19:02:14
Ben Fickes,I know itâs really about the pillow,37,7,19:00:14
Erica Yee,i really like your couch lol,28,6,18:59:56
Erica Yee,yeah sounds good,16,3,18:59:53
Ben Fickes,Unless you prefer yours anyway,30,5,18:56:00
Ben Fickes,Maybe we can plan on mine and we can always move if youâd prefer,66,14,18:55:52
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think it will be,23,6,18:55:31
Erica Yee,Assuming it's available,23,3,18:55:25
Erica Yee,But if we want to watch or game probably yours?,47,10,18:55:11
Erica Yee,Mine is probably free (not sure when Claire's parents are coming but not yet at least haha),91,17,18:54:49
Ben Fickes,Whose place? At first I was thinking not mine because of Shania needing to sleep here but Thiago said he wonât be home all night (and Iâm guessing sheâs not going to just show up on her own). So idk I guess maybe thatâs not until much much later?,254,49,18:51:25
Erica Yee,No rush,7,2,18:50:52
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good! Will shoot for around then but Iâll let you know,68,13,18:50:22
Erica Yee,"I'll be free starting around 8, so whenever you want",52,10,18:49:58
Erica Yee,omg haha ofc,12,3,14:08:22
Ben Fickes,Just wanted to share: I'm in systems and the prof asked who was already done the hw. One person raised their hand. It was Michael haha,134,26,13:43:56
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,12:21:23
Ben Fickes,Iâm pretty flexible with time so lemme know whenever,54,9,12:19:33
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good haha,21,4,12:18:29
Erica Yee,I don't really feel like going out so let's just feel it out (as usual)?,72,15,12:16:22
Erica Yee,But I did get a big slice of pizza togo that could be late night snack haha,75,17,12:15:04
Erica Yee,Probably not late dinner because I just had an earlyish lunch,61,11,12:14:43
Ben Fickes,We could do a late dinner if you wanted too,43,10,11:33:47
Ben Fickes,Idk. We could do museum but prob won't have a lot of time (idk when they close). We could watch a movie or something? Or game? Sorry I feel like I always say those two things but idk what else to do besides going out. Which I'm definitely good with but idk what's open this late,278,56,10:42:02
Erica Yee,What do you want to do tonight beside Bible study?,50,10,10:40:32
Ben Fickes,Yeah of course! And yeah I guess it's because she has an early morning shift or something? Idk,94,18,10:40:12
Erica Yee,And no problem but ð®ð®,27,5,10:39:28
Erica Yee,I do want to try it but we can another time haha,48,12,10:39:12
Ben Fickes,On the couch haha,17,4,10:38:08
Ben Fickes,Oh as a heads up I think Thiago said Shania is coming over here and spending the night,86,18,10:38:02
Ben Fickes,"Haha sounds good! I think the first will be better for me because I feel like I'm less productive in the evening anyways (and, like you said, something to look forward to). BB was mainly for if you really really wanted to try it now haha",237,46,10:37:47
Erica Yee,Plus I think I'll be more productive if I have something to look forward to haha,80,16,10:31:42
Erica Yee,Hmm I'm leaning toward first because I have leftovers I need to finish today for dinner,87,16,10:31:18
Ben Fickes,"2. Since I don't have psych, we could do the Boston Burger 420 deal, if they still have it. Idk how crowded it'll be, and I'd probably have to go back to working after that and Bible study since of course I can't sacrifice 7-8 hours of work...",243,48,10:26:08
Ben Fickes,1. Work until late and then call it quits around 9 or 10. We could Bible study and/or hang out then,99,21,10:24:39
Ben Fickes,So two ideas:,13,3,10:24:02
Ben Fickes,Okay haha my thoughts exactly,29,5,10:23:59
Erica Yee,But ofc need to chill at some point haha,40,9,10:23:47
Erica Yee,I was also planning to use today to work a ton,46,11,10:23:33
Erica Yee,Sure :),7,2,10:22:34
Ben Fickes,"So, Iâm thinking I probably canât work the whole day straight, so I may take a break at some point. Would you like to do our Bible study and/or hang out for a short time later? I know we saw each other yesterday so if youâd rather have a break thatâs all good too haha",276,55,9:59:22
Erica Yee,You're welcome haha,19,3,9:47:34
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad she wants to learn more about me haha ð,53,11,9:29:45
Ben Fickes,"Thatâs an incredibly kind reply, I feel very glad it seems like your grandma approves haha. Thank you for sharing that :)",123,22,9:29:03
Erica Yee,LOLOL thanks,12,2,7:39:28
Ben Fickes,Angela sent this to Thiago who sent it to me so Iâm passing it along,70,15,23:00:16
Erica Yee,haha anytime,12,2,22:38:47
Ben Fickes,I meant your email haha but I appreciate the reminder in case I happened to just forget,87,17,22:38:00
Erica Yee,i hope it's not a surprise to you,33,8,22:37:00
Ben Fickes,I meant with me but I guess with your grandma too,49,11,22:36:32
Ben Fickes,Aw thatâs actually really great! Does not sound awkward even though itâs out of the blue. Thanks for sharing,112,19,22:36:23
Erica Yee,and then the ice skating pic,28,6,22:35:24
Erica Yee,"Hi Grandma,

Just wanted to let you to know that I'm dating a guy named Ben. We met in InterVarsity and he's a nice Christian boy haha ð

Missing family and California weather (though I hope the rain isn't too bad)!

Love,
Erica",231,43,22:35:20
Ben Fickes,I am curious how you worded it because idk how I would even bring that up haha,78,17,22:31:34
Ben Fickes,Okay haha thank you,19,4,22:31:20
Erica Yee,and yeah haha,13,3,22:31:13
Erica Yee,will let you know how she replies,33,7,22:31:11
Erica Yee,ok i sent the email ð¬ð¬,28,6,22:31:06
Ben Fickes,From what you tell me though she seems personable so I'm sure she recovered the convo somehow,93,17,22:23:26
Ben Fickes,Oh dang haha well not like your sister had much of a choice,59,13,22:23:05
Erica Yee,LOL yikes,9,2,22:22:41

Erica Yee,"""julia""",7,1,22:22:12
Erica Yee,"yeah apparently when she met the CEO he was like ""what's your name""",67,13,22:22:11
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Glad sheâs going! And good stuff about her job I hope?,65,13,22:14:03
Erica Yee,heard more about her job,24,5,22:13:28
Erica Yee,the rest was alright. mostly trying to convince julia to come to israel with us (who wouldn't want to go on a trip your parents are paying for??) and guess she is now?,167,33,22:13:26
Erica Yee,HAHA she uses facebook and email a ton but does not have a smartphone,69,14,22:12:27
Ben Fickes,"I explained this all to Thiago because I was laughing. His first response was ""that's so awkward."" His second response was ""I'm surprised she has email, my grandma has nothing""",176,30,22:10:10
Ben Fickes,How was the rest of the skype call?,35,8,22:08:19
Ben Fickes,I am sending emotional support haha,35,6,22:08:12
Erica Yee,ok i'm just gonna do it..,25,6,22:07:39
Erica Yee,omg yeah yikes,14,3,22:07:26
Ben Fickes,Well if you get tagged in a post that will be a very interesting way for everyone we know to find out haha,106,23,22:05:51

Ben Fickes,HAHA so like when you see her or an email? And HAHA oh my goodness this is so funny. HAHAHA sorry I can't stop laughing at all of this,134,29,22:05:14
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:05:07
Erica Yee,mom: then tell her you had a bible study for your second date and it should be ok,81,18,22:04:55
Erica Yee,"me: ...do i tell her he's white
dad: just send a picture and get it over with",77,17,22:04:34
Erica Yee,"me: ""who would she even hear from if you guys don't tell her""
mom: ""you don't know if auntie terri (in hawaii!!!) can keep it secret for this long""",147,29,22:04:05
Erica Yee,because she can't hear it from anyone else first,48,9,22:03:23
Erica Yee,apparently i have to tell my grandma i'm dating,47,9,22:03:17
Erica Yee,just skyped my family,21,4,22:03:07
Ben Fickes,And thatâs awesome! Glad Joshs school can represent haha,58,9,21:12:33
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad! Thanks for letting me look at it,44,9,21:12:22
Erica Yee,also he is a prof at usc! https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/opinion/crazy-rich-asians-movie.html,97,8,20:57:37
Erica Yee,thank you! this was helpful,27,5,20:56:08
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,20:55:55
Ben Fickes,Restfulness not tearfulness idk how that happened,49,7,20:55:48
Erica Yee,oh i like that! and yeah restfulness,36,7,20:55:46
Ben Fickes,So everything but that is a measure of tearfulness and then the last question is a measure of stress?,101,19,20:55:27
Ben Fickes,Oh I see,8,3,20:55:05
Ben Fickes,Ah makes sense. Maybe something like âI regularly feel stressed?â Idk I trust your wording more than mine so you do what you think is best haha,147,27,20:54:52
Erica Yee,"ugh the only reason i have the stress question (and why it seems so different) is because you have to correlate the thing you're trying to measure (in this case, restfulness) with another measure taken at the same time that is known to be related (stress)",255,46,20:54:49
Erica Yee,HAHA aww,8,2,20:52:53
Erica Yee,i want it to be how the respondent perceives their own stress,61,12,20:52:44
Ben Fickes,John was shocked to see me at the thing tonight and asked why I wasnât with you. I told him we got breakfast and he said âIâm glad I get to hang out with you for vdayâ or something like that,198,41,20:52:26
Ben Fickes,And glad nu sci was good!,25,6,20:51:39
Ben Fickes,Hmm what made you decide to change it?,38,8,20:51:34
Erica Yee,"originally it was ""my life is stressful""",40,7,20:50:56
Erica Yee,ah i was thinking about that,28,6,20:50:42
Ben Fickes,"Survey looks really good! My only comment would be that I assume for the last question you mean stressed in general not the moment of taking the survey? I honestly think people will know perfectly well what you mean, and idk how you could reword it, so whatever, thatâs not very helpful feedback sorry haha",308,55,20:50:01
Erica Yee,it was an intro meeting for prospective editors so i just had to show my face but didn't have to talk,101,21,20:49:16
Erica Yee,blessedly brief,15,2,20:48:53
Ben Fickes,Thanks :) how was nu sci?,25,6,20:47:27

Erica Yee,"do you have a minute to look at my questionnaire? not to actually fill it out, but just make sure it all makes sense",116,24,20:06:21
Erica Yee,to both lol,11,3,20:03:55
Erica Yee,oh yikes,8,2,20:03:52
Ben Fickes,Oh also they all made up allergies for themselves,49,9,19:59:17
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. Good, many kids asked how many valentines I got haha. It was really sad though there was an opening question of naming three countries in Asia. They got Japan and China then gave up",189,35,19:45:40
Erica Yee,how was volunteering?,21,3,19:33:15

Erica Yee,ah wow that's cool they can support each other together,55,10,18:20:13
Ben Fickes,One womanâs husband just passed away in November so this is her first vday without him. So I think my mom is a caregiver in this scenario which really helps her,162,31,17:53:00
Ben Fickes,"Sheâs good. Sheâs going to a singles dinner tonight with 5 other women (3 widows, 1 divorced, 1 never married). So Iâm glad she has people to eat and talk with",165,31,17:52:26
Erica Yee,aww how is she doing?,21,5,15:04:43
Ben Fickes,"To talk to her and see how she was doing, not to tell her about the butter haha",79,18,15:03:17
Ben Fickes,I already did haha I called her right after you left,52,11,15:03:00
Erica Yee,nice! and yessss don't tell her about the butter xD,51,10,15:02:04
Ben Fickes,Yep! So that was actually really helpful,40,7,14:59:10
Erica Yee,for systems?,12,2,14:47:26
Ben Fickes,He also said âyour indentation is terribleâ haha,52,8,14:44:19

Ben Fickes,Wow way to go! And yep! Sounds like it was a not socially conscious thing more than anything else but Iâll talk more tomorrow about it,136,26,22:58:11
Erica Yee,oh wow! did you talk to him at dp?,34,9,22:51:38
Erica Yee,"well she's back to studying now, but think the break really was good. and she promised to get at least 8 hours of sleep lol",123,25,22:51:29
Ben Fickes,Btw will tell you more tomorrow but Dan messaged John back,58,11,22:46:48
Ben Fickes,Iâm sure that did help. Iâm glad you could be with her. Is she feeling better about the test? Or just more distracted haha,126,24,22:46:34
Erica Yee,we watched an episode of fresh off the boat and chatted. think it helped her relax a little... hopefully,104,19,22:38:28
Erica Yee,thanks :),9,2,22:38:15
Ben Fickes,"No worries glad you can be there for her, I will pray",53,12,21:35:29

Erica Yee,Aw I'm glad it was good,23,6,21:34:16
Ben Fickes,"It was really good! We spent like half an hour talking about different types of school but then had some good discussion. Curious to hear your thoughts on some of the stuff (for example, can we sin in heaven?). How was ENC?",223,42,21:24:45

Ben Fickes,No hot water for shower which was sad but I can live with it if that's the worst part of my day haha,100,23,14:02:07
Ben Fickes,"Glad to hear it! It's been good, got some good systems progress. Had to meet with a librarian for a research project for games and social justice and that took a lot longer than I expected so I didn't have time to run which is sad. But other than that good, pretty chill",270,53,14:01:45

Ben Fickes,So be very careful not to spill your water on accident ;),57,12,23:22:51
Ben Fickes,Signal is âaccidentallyâ spilling your water,48,6,23:22:37
Erica Yee,We need to come up with a signal ð¤ð¤,41,9,23:21:12

Ben Fickes,"No need to apologize! I am always here to support no matter how busy I am, please always feel free to ask haha",110,23,22:30:27

Erica Yee,Thank you!! I know you're very busy this weekend sorry but I really need support. I will see about Sunday,105,20,22:29:50
Erica Yee,Yes it was so hard omg and I was praying in my head but God didn't give me words like he sometimes does which is fine lol,121,27,22:29:08
Ben Fickes,"Oh and did not mean to volunteer you to meet up tomorrow but if youâd like to walk to class, if not Thursday",110,23,22:28:52
Ben Fickes,So I am really hoping they can become friends again,51,10,22:28:05
Ben Fickes,I can tell you more tomorrow (sadly itâs not all exciting) but Dan told me John reached out  to him and apologized about stuff,128,24,22:27:47
Ben Fickes,"Also, I have something exciting to tell you from LG",51,10,22:27:21
Ben Fickes,How was worship night in general?,33,6,22:27:07
Ben Fickes,Thanks for sharing all of that :),33,7,22:26:51
Ben Fickes,"Oh my goodness thatâs amazing! Iâm so glad you got to reach out to someone, I know it probably wasnât easy for you haha. So I am (possibly?) having a Costa Rica reunion over lunch on Saturday - maybe Sunday would be better? But if Saturday is the only day that works I can make it work in my schedule if need be, even if I just go to part of the hangout or something",372,75,22:26:42
Erica Yee,I was thinking of texting Katie or someone else who's good at talking lmao,74,14,22:24:47
Erica Yee,So think I'm gonna text him about lunch or something on Saturday. Would you be free? I really don't want to do this alone even though I know it's just casual hangout whatever,174,33,22:24:27
Erica Yee,But he really seemed like he was looking for friends and I didn't know what else to do so I was like let's exchange numbers and asked if he was free this weekend,161,33,22:23:21
Erica Yee,"During worship this guy walks in and is like ""can I join?"" So he sits next to me and I share lyrics on my phone while sing the rest. Later turns out he's a grad student from India and came to sacred space to do chanting (hindu?) And heard us. We invited him to LG and stuff but he was like ""I'd love to hang out with you guys. You guys are all friends right?"" And we were like ""umm kind of"" LOL ð­",399,84,22:22:11
Erica Yee,Just got back from weekly worship omg lol,41,8,22:17:55

Erica Yee,thanks for the clarification (Y),32,5,14:31:04

Erica Yee,(also i guess we've fully given up on the no food rule in the classroom now??),78,16,14:24:15
Erica Yee,thanks xD,9,2,14:24:03
Ben Fickes,If you would like expired chocolate instead you can have some but it is definitely not the same haha,100,19,14:20:16

Ben Fickes,If you end up wanting to work together though lemme know,56,11,10:21:11
Ben Fickes,Asa practical note I would still be down to do Bible study this weekend because I think itâs important but besides when Ariel comes and on the way to church I probably wonât be able to do much (unless I miraculously finish systems early and have time Monday). Sorry,269,49,10:20:43
Ben Fickes,"Thanks haha, thatâs what I keep telling myself",48,8,10:19:51
Erica Yee,But either way yay it's over haha. You got through it!,54,11,10:01:30
Erica Yee,"I think it's really cool you appreciate that some good can come out of this that you probably won't see directly, whether that's for you and/or your groupmates",159,28,10:01:13
Ben Fickes,"No worries ttyl, thanks for listening",37,6,9:06:08
Erica Yee,Sorry class starting again ttyl,31,5,8:50:18
Erica Yee,Ah thanks for sharing. I think it's ok to feel annoyed,54,11,8:50:08
Ben Fickes,"I know you're asleep but gonna vent slightly. While I am definitely annoyed that my group members didn't do more or start earlier, I know they did try hard today and idk what they have going on in their lives. And on the way back from the library yuheng asked me about what video games which I felt like was a reminder that these are people. So I am annoyed still but maybe there was good in this I can't see and/or it is significant to them",441,87,0:27:07
Ben Fickes,"Just âfinished,â itâs kinda broken (the ball can phase through the left and top walls). I didnât right the code for the physics so I tried to fix it but couldnât. Hopefully they donât take off too much",213,38,23:53:50
Ben Fickes,Thanks,6,1,23:52:50
Erica Yee,yay i'm glad! i know you put so much work and stress into it,60,14,20:17:39
Ben Fickes,"It's decent. A couple bugs to fix still. But I got win and lose screens done so I feel pretty good about that. Theoretically we have a working game, just a couple bugs and polish things",185,36,20:10:03
Erica Yee,How's the project going?,24,4,20:05:32
Erica Yee,Yeah sure!,10,2,20:05:26
Ben Fickes,"Have no idea if thatâs a good way to think about it or not (have not really heard it from anyone else before I just randomly thought it), would love to talk to you about it sometime",183,37,19:13:28
Erica Yee,Lol hm interesting. Never thought about it that way,51,9,19:06:19
Ben Fickes,Can explain more later but to an extent I think of bible study as a sort of tithe of our relationship? Donât know if thatâs a good or bad way to think of it,160,34,18:53:57
Ben Fickes,Yeah sounds good!,17,3,18:53:16
Erica Yee,let's do that this weekend?,27,5,18:28:19

Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Iâll pray for peace for you. And glad you can refocus on God :),73,15,13:23:46
Erica Yee,which is good haha,18,4,13:14:35
Erica Yee,still feeling a bit apprehensive about tonight but i'm listening to the songs intentionally paying attention to the lyrics (instead of piano parts) which is helping me refocus on God,182,30,13:14:31
Erica Yee,"it's been good, pretty productive work-wise",43,6,13:11:48
Ben Fickes,Thanks. Howâs your morning been? And how are you feeling?,59,10,13:02:14

Erica Yee,ah ok,5,2,13:00:10
Ben Fickes,"Kinda annoyed at our international student because they clearly do not test what they push, all the code theyâve contributed so far has broken things",151,25,12:43:57
Ben Fickes,"Np, thanks for listening. Only one person showed up. But things are gonna be okay, the amount I personally have left to do seems manageable",139,25,12:43:06

Ben Fickes,Haha ð did he get it right this time? And Iâm surprised you fit an entire band in your classroom but I hope they were good moral support,141,28,9:08:56
Erica Yee,I raised my band in class today and I saw my Prof look at my nameplate to check before he said my name LOL (he's the one who called me the name of the other Asian girl before),175,38,9:04:28
Erica Yee,Thank you :),12,3,9:03:41

Ben Fickes,HAHA ð Iâm sure he would be surprised. And cool :) worst comes to worst we can just sit on the corner where weâre not disturbing anyone and watch on a computer haha (not actually),186,35,23:01:00
Erica Yee,"But yeah sounds good, we'll figure it out :)",44,9,22:59:47
Erica Yee,Honestly need to give him a Valentine's gift too based on what he does for me lol,81,17,22:59:29
Ben Fickes,Thiago says heâs fine,23,4,22:54:47
Ben Fickes,Yeah youâre definitely welcome here! Iâll check with John and Thiago. If I go to sleep before John gets back Iâll just assume itâs okay,143,25,22:54:43
Erica Yee,Yeah we can't watch here so if it's not disruptive I was thinking we could at yours or find a classroom,103,21,22:53:50
Ben Fickes,Hmm I think my roommates are usually out but I can ask if theyâll be here (Johns out rn though). Iâm sure theyâll be fine though. And sure Iâd be down to watch a movie! But does that conflict with Claireâs person being there?,235,44,22:46:31
Erica Yee,Also idk what you want to do but Sophie asked if I wanted to watch a movie (like at home) and I said maybe so a possibility? No pressure though,143,30,22:45:22
Erica Yee,Do you know if your place is free?,34,8,22:44:45
Erica Yee,Ok so we it's ok if we cook and eat here after theology but the guy Claire is seeing is going to come over later in the evening so I said I'd give them some space,162,36,22:44:12
Erica Yee,"it's ok, same",13,3,21:08:34

Erica Yee,"thanks, i like telling you",26,5,20:46:16
Ben Fickes,"Looking forward to hearing about it! And glad you get to read them, I would love to hear about those too as you read them :)",124,26,20:38:43
Erica Yee,*enjoyably wasting time,23,3,20:36:34

Erica Yee,it is a romance one but don't think i told you about it yet haha,64,15,20:36:04
Erica Yee,"i can describe more tmr but it's set in manila and i don't think i've ever read a book set in the philippines, so that was cool",127,27,20:35:48
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! The romance one?,25,5,20:35:08
Erica Yee,i also finished a book this afternoon which was really good in a surprising way,79,15,20:34:53
Ben Fickes,And dang we must be sharing fatigue haha,40,8,20:34:22
Ben Fickes,That's interesting. I feel like I'd try if I ever have free time again haha,75,15,20:34:15
Erica Yee,omg wait same,13,3,20:33:20
Erica Yee,i was just reading a verge article about it doens't need voice chat as much as overwatch to succeed even though you have to be in a team (unlike fortnite),154,30,20:33:17
Ben Fickes,Oh dang glad you got some rest and hope you feel better soon. I slept until past 10 which was a shocker,103,22,20:32:55
Erica Yee,LOL REALLY dang,15,3,20:32:35
Erica Yee,i took a very chill day which was nice. slept 10.5 hours which was really needed. my throat doesn't hurt today but nose etc was stuffy and i'm sneezing like every 10 mins lol,174,34,20:32:28

Erica Yee,sorry to hear about the group project :(,40,8,20:29:51
Erica Yee,aww you're so good with the kids,32,7,20:29:34
Ben Fickes,How was your day?,17,4,20:23:37
Ben Fickes,I just remind myself that 24 hours from now Iâll be eating fried rice with you after a nice night of theology discussion haha,127,24,20:23:33
Ben Fickes,Went to office hours after volunteering because I was having trouble with something for the group project and the TA couldnât figure it out. So Iâm pretty stressed about that,178,30,20:22:59
Ben Fickes,Volunteering was good! Arm wrestled these two kids over and over and âlostâ a lot. They told me to practice if I want to get better. Had to explain to a couple kids about my dad because of my bracelet (this happens about once or twice a semester). One kid asked if my mom was alive and I said yes and he said âat least the one who gave birth to you is alive!â Which is funny even though the topic isnât haha,417,83,20:22:27
Erica Yee,how was volunteering? when you have time to respond,51,9,20:02:46
Erica Yee,and omg ð®ð®,16,3,20:02:24
Erica Yee,no worries,10,2,20:01:54
Ben Fickes,Went to Lutheran group and ate a plastic covered roll without realizing there was plastic on it until halfway through...,120,20,19:57:36
Ben Fickes,Sorry for lack of replying today has been really crazy,54,10,19:56:35
Ben Fickes,Danny and I signed up but got waitlisted. Honestly I will be glad if I donât get off the waitlist because of homework,119,23,19:56:20
Erica Yee,i don't think i actually have to go though,42,9,18:48:56
Erica Yee,i just got assigned to write an article on the organizers,57,11,18:47:28
Erica Yee,are you doing hackbeanpot lol,29,5,18:47:17
Erica Yee,and ooh nice xd,15,4,17:15:23

Ben Fickes,Shania is at volunteering today haha,36,6,17:12:17
Ben Fickes,Oh awesome! :) Iâll send to my mom real quick and message you later after volunteering and office hours,105,19,17:12:09
Erica Yee,"mom: if they want to come earlier like mon or Tues that's ok, if only staying til Thurs. No definite plans then so can be flexible. As long as they know i may have other obligations - you and dad can host and be tour guide!",223,46,15:16:57
Ben Fickes,Np! Sleep well haha,19,4,0:06:17
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,23:46:59
Ben Fickes,"That's really awesome :) I'm glad you get to do that, for both you and them",75,16,23:29:44
Erica Yee,I know I complain a lot but I actually overall really like doing this and helping science majors get to write about stuff they're interested in,143,26,23:26:30
Erica Yee,Aww thanks,10,2,23:25:49
Ben Fickes,"Feel overcongratulatory saying this but since Iâm sure no one else will, glad you were there to be her editor, Iâm sure it was a big help to her",148,29,23:24:03
Ben Fickes,Oh I actually never knew that the rhino article was the half-formed one. But Iâm glad it turned out well!,107,20,23:23:20
Erica Yee,"nah i appreciate you asking but basically even though she sent me the draft that was still full of half-finished thoughts, she is a good writer. took my suggestions and explained everything well and actually got it under word count",231,40,23:20:48
Erica Yee,let's do a theological deep dive on the potential of synthetic rhino horns xD,77,14,23:19:40
Ben Fickes,I know you gave me the gist but just in case you have more on your mind,71,17,23:18:53
Ben Fickes,Yeah. Thatâs really good to hear! Anything you wanna talk about about that?,77,13,23:18:38
Erica Yee,it actually turned out really well and i'm glad it's going in the print,71,14,23:18:12
Erica Yee,you know the rhino article i was kinda freaking out about,57,11,23:17:59
Ben Fickes,Thanks :),9,2,23:11:19
Erica Yee,same to you :),14,4,23:05:59
Ben Fickes,"Haha well thank you for sharing about it, and (idk exactly how to phrase this, hope you get my point) but for having a mind and heart that ponders this stuff so deeply",167,33,23:02:39
Erica Yee,thank God you asked if i wanted to talk about it cuz i probably would've just wallowed in confusion the rest of the night lol,125,25,23:01:28
Erica Yee,yeah same i feel a lot better about understanding the passage now,65,12,23:00:36
Ben Fickes,Haha thanks. Thank you for all of this helpful info I really appreciate it. Definitely got more out of this than if I had just decided to read Isaiah 45,152,30,22:57:41
Erica Yee,wow you basically said it exactly lol,37,7,22:56:17
Erica Yee,"Two things Cyrus must do for God:â(1.) Jerusalem is Godâs city, but it is now in ruins, and he must rebuild it, that is, he must give orders for the rebuilding of it, and give wherewithal to do it. (2.) Israel is Godâs people, but they are now captives, and he must release them freely and generously, not demanding any ransom, nor compounding with them for price or reward. And Christ is anointed to do that for poor captive souls which Cyrus was to do for the captive Jews, to proclaim the opening of the prison to those that were bound (Isa. 61:1), enlargement from a worse bondage than that in Babylon.",612,112,22:56:02
Ben Fickes,And yes please!,15,3,22:55:39
Ben Fickes,Okay so averaging all this out I feel like what Iâm hearing is that it means he is anointed by God to do good things but not anointed in the way Jesus was to save human souls,176,37,22:55:35
Erica Yee,sorry one more copy & paste commentary,38,7,22:55:18
Ben Fickes,Oh dang thatâs really cool,28,5,22:54:51
Erica Yee,also whoa this was written 210 years before it happened apparently,66,11,22:54:19
Erica Yee,"Cyrus is here called Godâs anointed, because he was both designed and qualified for this great service by the counsel of God, and was to be herein a type of the Messiah.",171,32,22:53:52
Ben Fickes,Yeah I mean I definitely read the verses as God but the study note seems to suggest otherwise. So idk either,108,21,22:52:56
Erica Yee,So idk,6,2,22:51:00
Erica Yee,"Kinda but verse 1 also says the Lord...to his anointed, to Cyrus",64,12,22:50:58
Ben Fickes,"Wait this strikes me as saying the verses are as if being spoken from Marduk to Cyrus, not God to Cyrus? If Iâm understanding right?",134,25,22:48:31
Erica Yee,Ok here's what my study Bible says about it,43,9,22:45:19
Ben Fickes,"Because Peter says Jesus is *the* Messiah, not *a* Messiah, right?",66,11,22:44:51
Ben Fickes,Like I guess thinking about it there are other people who are anointed by God... but still,90,17,22:44:19
Ben Fickes,I never knew there were more than one âmessiahâ,51,9,22:44:01
Ben Fickes,Wait thatâs a lot for me to think about now,45,10,22:43:49
Ben Fickes,Holy cow,8,2,22:43:41
Erica Yee,And yep I think so!,19,5,22:43:16
Erica Yee,Interesting,11,1,22:42:50
Erica Yee,"The Persian emperor Cyrus is honored as the only foreigner in the Bible to be identified as the âmessiahâ or âanointed oneâ of YHWH, the Israelite God.1 Isaiah tells us that YHWH spoke âto his messiah, to Cyrus, whom I [YHWH] took by his right hand to subdue nations before himâ (Isaiah 45:1).

The title messiah means âanointed.â It is an anglicization of the Hebrew meshiach (jyvm). In Greek it is rendered Christos (cristos)âEnglish âChrist.â",467,75,22:42:47
Ben Fickes,Oh are you still feeling better btw?,36,7,22:34:30
Ben Fickes,"Haha yeah guess that's pretty exciting too ;) and of course! Thank you for discussing it, and I'm glad it was helpful!",118,22,22:34:20
Erica Yee,Thanks for discussing this with me! This was really helpful :),62,11,22:32:18
Erica Yee,Oh well I think our group has good talk about God restoring his kingdom and stuff anyway xD,91,18,22:31:39
Erica Yee,Ahh ok,6,2,22:31:20
Ben Fickes,"Yeah I think that makes sense. And a lot of prophets mix time periods they talk about (like another part of Isaiah, with the verse about a virgin conceiving, is talking about Israel defeating a specific king of that time)",221,40,22:30:22
Erica Yee,But Cyrus literally allowed Jewish exiles to return back to their homeland and build a temple,93,16,22:27:43
Erica Yee,"Like yeah, technically you could say Jesus came/is coming to set us free ""not for price or reward'",98,18,22:27:05
Erica Yee,"Anyway, I think my conclusion as of right now is that just because Isaiah has many many prophetic word about Jesus doesn't mean everything automatically points exactly to Him specifically",187,30,22:25:28
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,22:24:28
Ben Fickes,I see haha,10,3,22:24:28
Ben Fickes,Oh Israel pm,12,3,22:24:25
Erica Yee,Israeli pm,10,2,22:24:24
Ben Fickes,Actually I'll just google it,28,5,22:24:08
Ben Fickes,Feel ignorant for asking this but who is Netanyahu?,51,9,22:24:03
Ben Fickes,No worries this is very interesting haha,40,7,22:23:51
Erica Yee,Ok sorry sorry getting very sidetracked from the text lol,57,10,22:23:39
Erica Yee,WOW even netanyahu made the comparison after Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem,81,13,22:23:30
Ben Fickes,That seems like a convenient analogy as an excuse for ignoring immorality,73,12,22:22:00
Ben Fickes,That seems... I don't even know,31,6,22:21:29
Ben Fickes,Oh my,5,2,22:21:14
Erica Yee,Omg just googled it and got many articles about how some evangelicals see Trump as Cyrus,88,16,22:20:54
Ben Fickes,"Fwiw it says the Hebrew is just ""he."" But Cyrus is mentioned in verse 1",71,15,22:20:19
Erica Yee,"It makes a lot more sense to me with Cyrus now cuz the ""he"" was very random in our excerpt with no antecedent",109,23,22:19:27
Ben Fickes,Oh just read your Chronicles verse haha,39,7,22:19:04
Erica Yee,Yep and omg,11,3,22:18:26
Ben Fickes,And at least it wasn't five in a row haha,41,10,22:18:13
Ben Fickes,Cyrus was the Persian king dude right?,38,7,22:18:06
Erica Yee,Sorry accident ^ (though I am praying xD),41,8,22:17:56
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,22:17:39
Erica Yee,Nope according to Wikipedia lol,31,5,22:17:39
Ben Fickes,"Hmmm hmm hmmm so reading it as Cyrus the first time, I interpreted 13 as that God will use Cyrus even though Cyrus's motives are not focused on God. But now I see how it could also be about Jesus and his motives not being focused on reward",239,48,22:17:38
Erica Yee,Was Cyrus the one who let Nehemiah go back?,43,9,22:17:10
Erica Yee,2 chronicles 36:22-23,21,3,22:16:23
Ben Fickes,I feel like I've heard something along those lines before. Lemme check the verses again,87,15,22:15:45
Erica Yee,So we were saying the he is Jesus in a prophetic sense which seems like it could be right but also could be very wrong lol,122,26,22:13:55
Ben Fickes,Oh hmmm yeah that does seem a little lacking context,52,10,22:12:16
Erica Yee,But our handout only had 8-13 (which doesn't mention Cyrus) so idk if we were interpreting it with all the context we were supposed to lol,138,26,22:11:49
Ben Fickes,Well I guess I interpret Cyrus as Cyrus then haha,49,10,22:11:49
Ben Fickes,Ohhhh I see,11,3,22:11:29
Erica Yee,"Ok cuz in NIV/NLT it says Cyrus, but in ESV it just says he/him",63,14,22:11:18
Ben Fickes,Based on the earlier part?,26,5,22:11:13
Ben Fickes,I interpreted he as Cyrus?,26,5,22:11:06
Erica Yee,Ohh,3,1,22:10:49
Erica Yee,That's what the handout I studied in group was. So we were talking about who is he,82,17,22:10:46
Ben Fickes,Nah NIV,7,2,22:10:38
Erica Yee,You read ESV right?,19,4,22:10:12
Ben Fickes,I just read the whole chapter. Not sure I have many thoughts on the verses themselves in isolation? 13 is interesting to me,123,23,21:58:06
Erica Yee,Oh lol ok! We looked at verses 8-13,35,8,21:54:53
Erica Yee,No worries if you don't get around to it. I know I'm being very vague and you have other planned chapters to read,113,23,21:54:14
Ben Fickes,Gotcha haha. Well happy to listen if thereâs anything you wanna talk about. Gonna read the chapter now,104,18,21:53:59
Erica Yee,So I'm gonna look at my study Bible which might help,52,11,21:53:41
Erica Yee,"Hmm maybe? Thoughts are kinda all over the place. This is the passage that the sermon was on which I half listened to, and I really don't understand how he connected it to his points (but apparently I wasn't the only one who thought that so it's ok haha)",254,49,21:52:51
Ben Fickes,"Glad there were so many people! I'll look that up in a little bit, obviously do not know what it is right now but is it something you'd want to talk about?",155,32,21:48:42
Erica Yee,Had an interesting discussion on Isaiah 45. I still feel like I have a lot of questions and praying to do about it,114,23,21:48:02
Erica Yee,There ended being 12 people which is more than anybody expected ð®ð®,72,12,21:47:14
Erica Yee,"Lol ok, am intrigued",20,4,21:46:30
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad,12,3,21:46:21
Ben Fickes,Oh and remind me to tell you about âthe fratâ,49,10,21:45:06
Ben Fickes,"It was good! We had good discussion, some tough things came up (somewhat war stories esque). We read Exodus 32 primarily, canât remember if I told you that. Weâre doing part 2 next week. How was your evening?",212,38,21:44:57
Erica Yee,How did it go?,14,4,21:39:35
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,18:38:52

Erica Yee,I want to hear about IV and stuff!,34,8,9:26:45
Erica Yee,"I'm still good with going over, don't feel too bad right now",60,12,9:26:33
Ben Fickes,"If you arenât feeling up to coming over later thatâs totally fine, you are definitely welcome but if youâd rather just have time to yourself to rest thatâs completely okay",179,30,9:18:54
Erica Yee,"And thanks haha, will let you know",34,7,9:16:23
Erica Yee,Throat hurts and nose was stuffy when I woke up,47,10,9:16:11
Ben Fickes,Was about to offer you clementines later but guess that wouldnât help things much,83,14,9:09:30
Ben Fickes,Aw dang. Whatâs up? Just tiredness or other stuff? If you need anything lemme know,84,15,9:09:12

Ben Fickes,Unless you want to talk about it tomorrow,41,8,21:10:51

Erica Yee,Who are they?,13,3,20:51:36

Erica Yee,"Can tell you more tomorrow but side funny story: when Sophie said ""in the sermon today, abortion blah blah blah"" Barbara was like ""OH YOU HEARD IT IN THE SERMON? I thought you saw something about it on the news!"" Apparently she didn't hear it at all even though she was awake the whole sermon today LOL",302,57,23:30:41
Ben Fickes,"1. That's hilarious, thanks for sharing! 2. Thanks for sending that, if you want we can talk about it more in person but yeah I am definitely good with that haha",161,31,23:30:09
Erica Yee,3. Sophie wanted to talk about abortion cuz Pastor Adam brought it up in today's sermon and she didn't think she agreed with his stance,135,25,23:29:19
Erica Yee,I think you feel the same way? Please tell me either way lol and SORRY this should've been in person conversation but I was just thinking about it after I left,159,31,23:28:26
Erica Yee,"I know we said we're starting slowish (though honestly relatively to what, I'm not sure what that means) and we didn't get to labels yet, but I feel serious enough about it that I'm ok with being more ""public"" if that makes sense",229,43,23:27:50
Erica Yee,"2. If I wasn't clear before, I'm ok with telling people we're dating, mainly if they straight up ask lol",104,20,23:25:32
Erica Yee,"1. The groom's sister gave an emotional toast and then she was suddenly like ""and now I have hope for online dating!' and it was so funny",137,27,23:24:17

Erica Yee,How about curry at yours and then we can go get dessert or something?,69,14,17:51:08

Erica Yee,hmm I do like them and kinda want to see them,45,11,17:50:14
Ben Fickes,Itâs okay if you wanna wat out haha,37,8,17:48:44

Erica Yee,Is it people I know haha,24,6,17:47:40
Ben Fickes,Or I can bring you snacks there,31,7,17:46:18
Ben Fickes,"Haha ð that is true, thatâs what I was gonna say. If youâre hungry I would say either we can go out now or you can eat super bowl snacks here until rice cooks (but people are already over)",195,39,17:46:10
Erica Yee,I know I always ask and you say you can eat whenever but still lol,66,15,17:45:24
Erica Yee,LOL ok. How are you hungry are you?,35,8,17:45:12
Ben Fickes,I also only have brown rice haha,32,7,17:44:51
Erica Yee,"Ok here're my thoughts. I'm pretty hungry cuz I basically only had breakfast. I'm totally down for the curry, but I only have brown rice and that takes a while",159,30,17:44:34
Erica Yee,Hmm,3,1,17:42:50
Ben Fickes,Okay gotcha. So I guess we can make rice and have Matt's leftover curry or eat out,82,17,17:41:27
Erica Yee,Ok Sophie's definitely cooking around 7 so rules out that option,64,11,17:28:46
Ben Fickes,Okeydokey! Anything is fine with me so whatever works best for you and your roommates,85,15,17:26:51
Erica Yee,I'm asking if anyone was planning on cooking tonight,52,9,17:26:11
Erica Yee,So at least some apartment mates will definitely be home,56,10,17:26:02
Ben Fickes,Take your time haha,19,4,17:05:42
Ben Fickes,Great :) I would really like to see you too haha,48,11,17:05:37
Erica Yee,Sorry one sec,13,3,17:05:36
Erica Yee,I definitely want to see you,28,6,17:05:07
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,17:04:38
Ben Fickes,"Take your time getting settled and then let me know what would be best for you for dinner (I can cook here and bring it over, I can bring over ingredients, or we can eat out). Or if you'd rather have the evening to yourself that's all good too",243,49,17:03:31
Ben Fickes,Nice! Glad you arrived safely,29,5,17:02:21
Erica Yee,Just landed,11,2,16:56:56
Ben Fickes,Ttyl,4,1,11:44:13
Erica Yee,Ok talk to you soon,19,5,11:44:06
Erica Yee,Yeah that sounds good :),24,5,11:44:03
Erica Yee,Flight should get in around 5:30,32,6,11:43:57
Ben Fickes,We can either eat out or if your place is empty eat there?,58,13,11:43:47
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good! Safe flight and hope you get to rest some :),62,13,11:43:28
Erica Yee,Ahh gtg very soon sorry but I would probably prefer not to be around so many people cuz this weekend was kinda a lot of socializing,131,26,11:43:07
Erica Yee,I'm a bit tired but doing pretty well. This flight is soo empty I have a whole row to myself,92,20,11:42:31
Ben Fickes,"I also have a few slight complications about dinner: John and Thiago invited a bunch of people over for the super bowl, we can still cook but depending on time we might have to wait for them to cook. Alternatives if you donât have time to wait or donât want to be around so many people are we can eat their super bowl food, leftovers Matt made Friday, or go out",365,71,11:40:50
Ben Fickes,"It was good! Sermon was on suffering servant passage, I can tell you more about it later. Whenâs your flight? And how are you doing?",134,25,11:38:12
Erica Yee,How was church?,15,3,11:08:30
Ben Fickes,Np!,3,1,10:32:12
Erica Yee,Thank you!,10,2,10:03:23
Ben Fickes,Good morning and hope you have a safe flight :),47,10,7:49:57

Ben Fickes,Awesome! Hopefully it tastes delicious too haha,47,7,12:53:49
Erica Yee,That sounds delicious ð,26,4,12:44:09
Ben Fickes,Also unrelated but is chicken parm okay for dinner tomorrow?,60,10,12:17:45
Ben Fickes,"Dang that sounds so cool, if Josh becomes a magician after this class I would totally be his assistant haha. Hope your parents enjoy the show! And yeah he sent me a few pics but I havenât gotten to ask him about it in depth",225,45,12:17:27
Erica Yee,"Oh that reminds me I saw Josh's ig post the other day about the one he went to, glad he enjoyed it!",99,22,12:10:29
Erica Yee,So they're going to a magic show tonight hahaha,47,9,12:09:50
Erica Yee,Apparently he does magic as a hobby and my mom used to be an assistant for him and get sawed in half (it was an evangelistic thing at youth groups but idk how they incorporated the gospel lol),192,38,12:09:39
Erica Yee,Omg so I think I told you my parents are ditching us to hang out with an old friend after the reception,103,22,12:08:43
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness ððð I was laughing in the kitchen haha,62,11,12:08:18
Erica Yee,Lol jk I love taking scripture out of context,45,9,12:05:29
Erica Yee,"""run in such a way to get the prize"" ðð",45,10,12:05:16
Ben Fickes,Haha ð maybe I have to race him to earn his approval,55,12,12:02:45
Erica Yee,"My dad said ""Ben's nice"" so I think that's approval? Lol",56,11,11:54:59
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,11:52:32
Ben Fickes,Hope you enjoy the wedding today! :),36,7,11:32:50
Erica Yee,Ah I see :),11,4,11:12:39
Ben Fickes,Not that the fire scene is happy but it reminds me of him,57,13,1:10:04
Ben Fickes,Yeah I like the music too. Very random but because of my dad I like the fire scene. And oh wow had no idea there were so many famous people from Oakland!,153,32,1:08:36
Erica Yee,Ohh that's fun. Yah you know me I have judgy opinions but like the music and love Zendaya (she's from Oakland xD),113,22,0:34:22
Ben Fickes,Haha ð and itâs Greatest Showman. Know youâre not a huge fan haha,72,13,0:27:18
Erica Yee,Ooh what movie?,15,3,0:19:09
Erica Yee,Never seen my mom honk so much,30,7,0:19:03
Erica Yee,Evening has been pretty good. So much driving which always reminds me why I dislike LA lol,90,17,0:18:53
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang I really hope sheâs okay. Sorry to hear that. Itâs been good, weâre watching a movie now. We won book 1 and lost book 2 ð how has your evening been?",165,33,0:13:35
Erica Yee,How was hanging with your friends? I saw your Harry Potter snap!,64,12,23:36:40
Erica Yee,Apparently my cousin who's getting married had a semi bad allergy attack at dinner tonight.. she's recovering now so hopefully she's ok ð¬,140,23,23:36:10
Ben Fickes,I canât wait to hear about it! And Iâm glad haha sorry I didnât mention it earlier I can tell you more in person too,122,25,23:14:00
Erica Yee,But oh yay that makes me relieved actually xD,45,9,22:38:29
Erica Yee,She said a lot more that I'll tell you later haha,49,11,22:38:06
Ben Fickes,Realize I havenât told you about telling my mom but she was happy. She likes you and also absolutely adores your mom haha,123,23,22:03:00
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness that makes me so happy ð thank you for sharing that and telling your mom,90,18,22:02:20
Erica Yee,Also there's more I will try to type out later but I told my mom about us (haven't seen my dad and sister yet) and she's so happy lol. Apparently she really likes you,166,34,21:59:46
Erica Yee,I will try!,11,3,21:59:12
Ben Fickes,Dang not that Iâm from Oakland but that sounds cool. I know you canât explain it all but would love to hear any more thoughts you have (if any) sometime,156,30,21:08:06
Erica Yee,Blindspotting was soooo good. I don't even know how to explain it. It just captures Oakland in such a profound and complex way,126,23,20:02:29
Ben Fickes,Oh wow that sounds super interesting. Gotta go for a bit but curious how the movie was and would love to hear more about the book,129,26,19:49:05
Erica Yee,"Watched movie blindspotting, did homework, started this alternate history book about if we got people to Mars earlier that's pretty good",136,21,19:33:50
Ben Fickes,Oh glad youâre feeling alright! I hope you have a great evening with your family :),85,16,19:33:08
Erica Yee,"I didn't sleep but actually feeling alright, thanks for asking :)",65,11,19:32:41
Ben Fickes,Glad to hear it! And wow thatâs a great achievement haha. Did you get to rest at all?,87,18,19:31:26
Erica Yee,Actually finished coding homework. First time I've ever done coding without access to stack overflow LOL but it was simple enough,129,21,19:28:57
Erica Yee,Just landed,11,2,19:28:12
Erica Yee,And yay I'm glad :),19,5,19:28:10
Erica Yee,Never heard of him,18,4,19:28:04
Ben Fickes,Also just wanted to let you know the exam went well!,52,11,15:54:18
Ben Fickes,My professor mentioned a guy named Cornel West in class and specifically mentioned heâs Christian. Can tell you about it later but was curious if youâd heard of him (I know youâre better read than I am),208,37,13:27:35
Ben Fickes,Dang sorry to hear that,23,5,13:26:29
Erica Yee,Didn't board yet though thankfully,34,5,11:59:55
Erica Yee,Jk there's a maintenance delay at least an hour rip,51,10,11:59:30
Erica Yee,Thanks! Hope classes are good and you enjoy time with your friends later,72,13,11:33:43
Ben Fickes,Leaving for class but once again hope your flight is safe and you have a great time with your family,100,20,11:33:10
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad x),15,4,11:13:21
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð glad you could help her out. Thanks for sharing! I am more than slightly amused haha,94,18,11:11:45
Erica Yee,"So I got this teriyaki rice bowl (always down for Americanized Chinese airport food) and they gave me a fork. I saw they had chopsticks on the counter so I took a pair. Then this middle aged white lady comes over with a salad needing a utensil but there's only chopsticks out. She mumbles to herself ""guess I can eat salad using chopsticks??"" I offer my fork since I was gonna use the chopsticks anyway and she was very very grateful HAHA",438,82,11:09:41
Ben Fickes,Do tell so I can be slightly amused,35,8,11:07:43
Erica Yee,Slightly funny story just happened while I was buying lunch,59,10,11:07:22
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,11:07:08
Ben Fickes,Oh dang that kinda stinks but glad you made it there like you said,66,14,11:03:00
Erica Yee,But made it safely whoo,23,5,11:02:28
Erica Yee,The Lyft driver was probably the worst I've ever had though. He asked me how to get to the airport..dude look at the directions on your phone and follow the signs?? Also do you not see the lanes markers in the tunnel?!,218,42,11:02:25
Ben Fickes,Glad you got through alright,28,5,11:02:02
Ben Fickes,Dang maybe you could've kept your knives haha. And now I know not to mess with you since you have pepper spray haha,115,23,11:01:56
Erica Yee,Made it through security no problem even though I also realized I didn't take out my pepper spray (which is illegal in Massachusetts) but guess it was small enough,163,29,11:00:58
Erica Yee,Gotcha haha,11,2,11:00:24
Ben Fickes,Sadly no haha completely different,34,5,10:59:57
Erica Yee,Oh yay! Is this one of the same partners in the group project?,62,13,10:59:33
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,10:59:18
Ben Fickes,Donât think I explained my Game Engine lab but short of it is I did a lot in class and I got an email from my partner last night and he fixed a bug we hit so thatâs really nice because itâs one less thing to worry about,225,48,10:28:03
Ben Fickes,I did! Feeling kinda lethargic this morning but oh well. Decided not to run today so Iâm just working and studying until class,128,23,10:27:17
Erica Yee,Did you sleep ok?,17,4,10:23:57
Erica Yee,Aw thanks xD really appreciate it. but it's not a big deal so no worries haha,77,16,10:23:32
Erica Yee,Nah just tired. I might even sleep on the plane which I rarely do,65,14,10:23:12
Ben Fickes,I would offer to take them back but Iâd probably miss class plus I might be too late anyways,94,19,10:22:49
Ben Fickes,Do you have a headache or just tired? And dang that is really sad... maybe you can give them to a random person who landed? But also thatâd be pretty suspicious haha,167,32,10:22:21
Erica Yee,Idk what I was thinking last night xD,37,8,10:21:41
Erica Yee,Ok just looked it up and I should just dump them. Sad cuz they're nice but wasn't using them anyway so it's fine,112,23,10:21:32
Erica Yee,They are ceramic not metal though so idk if I should try to get them through?? Lol yikes,88,18,10:20:36
Erica Yee,Last night I was packing stuff I wanted to give to my family to bring home like books. I packed a set of knives that I wasn't using. But I just realized I shouldn't have done that since o just have a carry-on,208,43,10:20:15
Erica Yee,Actually first coffee I've bought since coming to school! Proud of myself,73,12,10:19:09
Erica Yee,I'm ok haha. Drank a Dunkin latte during class,46,9,10:18:37
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. How are you feeling? I know you probably didn't get a lot of sleep...,77,15,10:17:07
Erica Yee,Np! Lyfting to airport rn,25,5,10:13:33
Ben Fickes,"Gotcha. I think that does make sense (you explained it really well!), thanks for sharing and taking the time to type that all out",129,24,10:12:08
Erica Yee,Hope that kinda makes sense ð¬,32,6,10:10:33
Erica Yee,"The public probably doesn't need to know all this technical info to be informed about the nuclear debate, but that does mean the government can prevent publication of it",169,29,10:10:17
Erica Yee,"Our question was whether we agreed  with the government's argument that sometimes public info shouldn't be public anymore, and we said generally disagreed because what's the difference between a publication's right to disseminate this info and an individual person accessing it if it's already out there",303,46,10:09:27
Erica Yee,"So basically this magazine wanted to print this article about how to make an atomic bomb based on information public in the domain. the government was like even if it's public, the way the article pulled all of it together gave away confidential information that could help other countries make their own bombs",310,53,10:06:48
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang that's awesome! Way to go :) glad your prof liked it too! I know you can't explain it all to me but what ""side"" were you on (if it's that simple which I know it might not be)",182,40,10:02:03
Erica Yee,Sorry too complicated to explain but it was basically about if public information should always be considered public in the case of atomic bomb details,151,25,10:00:37
Erica Yee,I had to present what my discussion group talked about in class cuz I was the only one who printed the case out lol but it actually went pretty well and the Prof liked it :),173,36,9:59:19
Ben Fickes,Okay haha sounds good :),24,5,9:53:37
Erica Yee,And whatever you want haha,26,5,9:49:42
Erica Yee,"Thanks, I'll let you know how it goes",37,8,9:49:19
Ben Fickes,"Also, Iâm going to the grocery store tomorrow, so if thereâs anything you think of today you want for dinner Sunday (or want to eat out) just let me know ð",162,31,9:06:06
Ben Fickes,Oh dang well Iâm glad they got a hotel! Hope you have a safe flight today!,76,16,9:03:32
Erica Yee,Omg the Airbnb owner never answered her phone so my mom and sister got a very last minute hotel lol,99,20,6:24:59
Ben Fickes,Iâm glad ð,15,3,0:49:08
Erica Yee,"Thanks for having me, it was very worth",39,8,0:46:34
Ben Fickes,"Awesome :) hope you sleep well! And thank you again for coming over, it was really nice spending time with you ð",115,22,0:39:46

Erica Yee,none of my writers are here so i hope i dont have to do anything,64,15,20:07:41
Ben Fickes,And hope your meeting goes well!,32,6,20:07:24
Ben Fickes,Whenever you get here just let me know,38,8,20:07:15
Ben Fickes,okay sounds good!,17,3,20:07:06
Erica Yee,your place sounds good to me if it works for you,48,11,20:06:46
Erica Yee,ohh gotcha,10,2,20:06:32
Ben Fickes,We can definitely still talk privately if they are here but I probably wonât tell you about Johns stuff if heâs here,120,22,19:48:35
Ben Fickes,So John and Thiago are both hear. They might be going to BCEC small group in a little bit idk,93,20,19:48:09
Ben Fickes,No haha I went to my Lutheran group and just got back,53,12,19:46:53
Erica Yee,Whoa were you at volunteering till now?,39,7,19:33:20

Erica Yee,hope volunteering is good!,26,4,14:18:53
Erica Yee,yeah ð¬ my mom and sister are driving down now,48,10,14:18:46
Ben Fickes,Oh dang hope everythingâs okay. And hope it wasnât too bad to have your phone go off in class haha,102,20,14:13:46
Erica Yee,"My mom called during my class so it rang and I scrambled to decline it. But when I texted her what's up, she was like ""nothing sorry"" yikes lol",143,29,13:39:23
Erica Yee,"Morning was good. I always have my phone on do not disturb, but with the setting of if certain people call, it'll ring since I rarely get calls",143,28,13:38:21
Erica Yee,Haha yay,8,2,13:37:23
Ben Fickes,Howâs your morning been?,26,4,11:54:38
Ben Fickes,Pretty good! Danny is going to the gym 4 times a week and Iâve gone twice this semester so I know Iâm gonna fall behind him soon haha,137,28,11:54:29

Ben Fickes,Glad you got some rest! How are you feeling? And okeydokey I can give you an update on whoâs home while youâre at nusci,123,24,9:36:49
Erica Yee,People will probably be home at my place but we'll see,54,11,9:35:58
Erica Yee,Hmm let's play by ear,21,5,9:35:33
Erica Yee,Omg slept in instead of going to the gym which was probably a good idea,71,15,9:35:05
Ben Fickes,"We can also play it by ear and figure it out later, whatever works best for you",79,17,8:21:29
Ben Fickes,See you tonight :) I did want to ask - where do you want to meet? John and Thiago are usually out on Thursday nights I think but if theyâre not I donât think Iâll be able to talk to you about the John stuff here,217,46,8:19:56
Ben Fickes,Goodnight!,10,1,23:29:23
Erica Yee,Thanks :) good night!,21,4,23:29:15
Ben Fickes,I appreciate that you appreciate it haha. And haha yeah I thinks itâs a process and I donât want you to feel pressure to be perfectionistic by me saying I admire your work and writing etc. but want you to know I know you work really hard!,242,47,23:27:06
Erica Yee,"Sophie sitting next to me here can attest that I'm periodically whispering ""DON'T BE A PERFECTIONIST"" to myself haha",116,19,23:24:44
Erica Yee,Aw I appreciate that,20,4,23:24:05
Ben Fickes,Hope you sleep well!,20,4,23:23:41

Erica Yee,and oh nice haha,16,4,23:21:37
Erica Yee,with Jesus i should hope so,27,6,23:21:30

Ben Fickes,"HAHA âdonât worry Erica, Iâm not the man I once was!â",61,11,23:15:00
Erica Yee,do you get compensated,22,4,23:14:55
Erica Yee,we'll work through it xD,24,5,23:13:43
Ben Fickes,"If I change personalities completely, please forgive me and tell my mom haha",76,13,23:10:19
Ben Fickes,Idk but it requires that English is my first language and that I wear corrective lenses if I require any,104,20,23:09:55
Erica Yee,oooh what is it,15,4,23:09:27
Ben Fickes,not to distract you but I just signed up for an experiment tomorrow,67,13,23:03:21

Ben Fickes,No worries! Figured you're more pressed for time rn and also I've definitely asked you a million things instead of looking them up haha,135,24,22:43:51
Erica Yee,and ooh nice!,13,3,22:43:22

Erica Yee,need to cut like 100 words lol but i think i can do that tomorrow,65,15,22:34:52
Erica Yee,i'm alright. just banged some semblance of my rough draft for nu sci,68,13,22:34:40
Erica Yee,(i'm using messenger on my laptop so thanks for the double affirmation),71,12,22:34:17
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,22:34:00
Erica Yee,if other people could pick up our chili crumbs that would be gr9,64,13,22:33:26
Ben Fickes,How are you doing?,18,4,22:30:49
Ben Fickes,I thought he meant actual crumbs from the bread I was eating. But then yeah and we mention same events (like going to Love Art Sushi). Part of me thinks a lot of people know but also people probably donât examine our lives as closely as we do,244,48,22:30:43
Erica Yee,like we've been arriving/leaving together for stuff,51,7,22:29:49
Erica Yee,but actually probably can see lol,33,6,22:29:37
Erica Yee,"at first i was like ""what breadcrumbs""",38,7,22:29:30
Ben Fickes,And I know haha I can picture the scene very clearly,52,11,22:29:04
Ben Fickes,HAHA yeah no coupon,19,4,22:28:51
Erica Yee,also LOL KATIE,14,3,22:28:49
Erica Yee,no coupon tho?,14,3,22:28:40
Erica Yee,OH,2,1,22:28:37
Ben Fickes,Panera haha,11,2,22:28:28
Erica Yee,np! glad you go to hang with him. what restaurant was that??,60,12,22:28:12
Ben Fickes,Also a quote from Jason during dinner: âI feel like you guys are dropping a lot of breadcrumbs people arenât picking up.â,127,22,22:12:44
Ben Fickes,"Katie (upon leaving the apartment Sunday): âAre Ben and Erica dating?â
Jason: âI donât know. Iâll let you draw your own conclusions.â
K: âItâs fine if you canât tell me. I can talk to them directly.â",219,36,22:12:10
Ben Fickes,"I have a funny story from dinner with Jason Iâll try to recreate here (in short, Katie does suspect us haha):",111,21,22:10:30
Ben Fickes,"Sorry just got back from dinner with Jason. Thatâs interesting, do hers? Menâs group was good, just me Jason and Dara. Did a prayer prompt but otherwise pretty standard (we looked at Luke 4)",194,34,22:10:01
Erica Yee,How was men's group?,20,4,21:05:17
Erica Yee,"I was like, umm I think they're pretty equal??",46,9,21:03:32
Erica Yee,Oh not really a highlight but she asked if my parents had traditional gender roles and I was kinda taken aback cuz never was asked that before,142,27,21:02:58
Erica Yee,Her daughter is a high school senior so asked a lot of college advice (which I'm bad at giving with my not great memory lol),124,25,21:02:24
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! Any particular highlights? And yeah if thatâs good with you!,71,12,20:27:26
Erica Yee,Are we doing all of Galatians 1 tomorrow btw?,45,9,19:57:28
Erica Yee,And you're very welcome :) thanks for the lunch offer,53,10,19:56:48
Erica Yee,Dang Josh that sounds so cool,29,6,19:56:12
Erica Yee,Dinner was really good! She asked a lot of questions lol,56,11,19:56:00
Ben Fickes,Oh also for the sake of explicity (even though I think you know) I wanted to say that that even though I couldnât come over before class today I appreciate the invitation and in general enjoy hanging out and/or studying with you :),233,43,18:10:38
Ben Fickes,Hope you have a good dinner with your cousin! I have a story from Josh: his magic professor is taking them on a field trip to a highly exclusive magic club ð®,160,32,17:56:17
Erica Yee,Np same,7,2,14:32:01
Ben Fickes,Jut leaving so sorry!,21,4,14:31:11
Ben Fickes,Okay just need to put on clothes and then Iâll head toward cross streets. If youâre not there Iâll walk toward your place,127,23,14:27:12
Erica Yee,Np just lemme know when/where,29,5,14:05:51
Ben Fickes,Okay for today I donât think Iâll have time because I need to clean stuff and shower but I might be able to meet you at your door,133,28,14:02:57
Erica Yee,Kk sounds good,14,3,13:56:00
Ben Fickes,Np! Iâm almost done cooking but I have to shower still. If itâs before 2:30 Iâll head over then haha,106,20,13:53:49
Erica Yee,You can come over earlier if you want btw though,48,10,13:52:21
Erica Yee,I did! Had leftovers. But thanks!,33,6,13:49:22
Ben Fickes,Did you get a chance to cook/eat? If not I can bring you something in a little bit,82,18,13:44:41
Erica Yee,Ikr ð¬,8,2,9:16:02
Ben Fickes,Haha ð and that actually is super impressive! Guess youâre really memorable to them for better or worse haha,113,19,9:08:21
Erica Yee,I'm actually impressed she recognized me from the back in winter wear after only seeing me like twice lol,105,19,9:07:38
Erica Yee,It was my volunteering supervisor lol,37,6,9:05:20
Erica Yee,"I was walking on the last block to the society and then someone behind me was like ""HI"" and I jumped so hard",108,23,9:05:06
Ben Fickes,Np :),5,2,8:33:26
Erica Yee,Thanks :),9,2,8:31:19
Ben Fickes,Ah gotcha. Glad youâre still feeling alright. Hopefully if you can last til the weekend being healthy theyâll get better while youâre back home,149,24,8:13:14
Erica Yee,But I feel alright,18,4,8:11:10
Erica Yee,"I was, but went to bed later then I wanted to and my roommates are all kinda coughing",85,18,8:10:58
Ben Fickes,Were you able to sleep?,23,5,7:55:04
Erica Yee,Hope I don't fall asleep during lol,35,7,7:54:13
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,7:53:54
Ben Fickes,Hope your volunteering goes well today :),41,7,7:18:46
Erica Yee,cool cool,9,2,21:42:18
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! :),19,4,21:40:55
Erica Yee,and sure :) meet at hemenwayXwestland at around 230?,52,9,21:40:26
Erica Yee,no problem,10,2,21:38:14
Erica Yee,ooh gotcha. yeah i saw the flurries! so pretty,46,9,21:37:57
Ben Fickes,"And Matt says thanks, heâs trying to organize something for IISE with a professor who can teach code",102,18,21:31:46
Ben Fickes,Oh also unrelated but since we have class at the same tomorrow do you want to walk over/back together?,102,19,21:26:53
Ben Fickes,Yeah I was studying for psychology but losing steam so decided to use the walk back as a break (itâs snowing btw!),116,22,21:26:33
Erica Yee,were you doing work  in ryder?,30,6,21:25:18
Ben Fickes,Oh nice,7,2,21:24:00
Erica Yee,"Manipulating a web page using it, yeah",38,7,21:22:02
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs awesome! Making a webpage with it? And okay awesome Iâll send the info his way,92,17,21:13:31
Erica Yee,"I took database design with Katherine Durant, which used SQL. I'm pretty sure she also teaches data science classes with R. So maybe a good place to start?",155,28,20:57:12
Erica Yee,Class ended up being really cool! Learned actually new and useful stuff about dynamically generating content using JavaScript,125,18,20:55:51
Ben Fickes,My pure guess is Matt wants to put those on his resume so itâs either for taking classes or doing research,108,21,20:53:40
Ben Fickes,No problem! How was class? Iâm gonna walk back from Ryder now so Iâll be a bit to reply. And I have no idea haha,116,25,20:53:20
Erica Yee,What does Matt need the prof for lol,36,8,20:52:53
Erica Yee,Thanks for sharing and typing that all out! Really appreciate it,64,11,20:52:24
Erica Yee,Oh wow,6,2,20:51:53
Ben Fickes,And she says plans are good and she really likes planning but they donât always happen like we think they will,112,21,19:31:45
Ben Fickes,"And she said âTo be frank, I am 31 and Christian and I thought I would be married by now, probably a foster mom. This was not in my plan. But me not getting my plans allowed for such wonderful friends and experiences.â",222,43,19:31:07
Ben Fickes,"So she started with âwhere do you see yourself in 5 years? 10? Where will you live? What relationships will be important to you?â Then at the end she asked âwhat happens if your plans are changed or indefinitely postponed? Will you work harder, chance strategies, give up, etc?â",286,49,19:29:40
Ben Fickes,"As for actual lesson, Christine talked a lot about plans and specifically them not working out. She shared how she got a degree in ministry from college and had a boyfriend (same one) throughout and planned to graduate, get married a year later, and have a job in PA at a church. She broke up with her bf and the recession hit at the same time so she was working part time at a Dressbarn. She got FB messaged about going to Boston to work for 11K a year and took it knowing that she could sleep on someoneâs couch (but she didnât know how long). One of her roommates got married and sheâs lived there since coming to Boston. She shared about her friends Kevin and his eventual wife whose name I forget and a girl named Erica she met at her first volunteering with college kids and her husband Jonathan",807,152,19:28:06
Ben Fickes,"So I know youâre in class, but Iâll give my IV summary. Before that, Matt asked me if I knew any professors that taught R, Python, or SQL. I donât but I said Iâd ask you because I think youâve mentioned using R and Python before",238,46,19:22:27
Ben Fickes,nichols,7,1,17:43:06
Erica Yee,ty,2,1,17:42:43
Ben Fickes,Hope your class is good :),26,6,17:40:10
Ben Fickes,I will! I think Christine is speaking. Iâll try to take mental notes haha,75,14,17:40:00
Erica Yee,hope iv is good! please tell me how it goes,43,10,17:39:30
Erica Yee,think it's the latter but thanks :P,35,7,17:39:20
Ben Fickes,Haha glad you hopefully get some more content (sorry if itâs the same content spread out),91,16,17:37:52
Erica Yee,apparently we're now learning javascript in 3 weeks instead of just 2 xD,72,13,17:37:10
Erica Yee,ok sounds good!,15,3,14:47:05
Ben Fickes,Yeah I would love that :) thanks Erica! If somehow you end up swamped until the last minute no worries but it'd be nice to meet up then if you do have the time :),162,35,13:59:30
Erica Yee,If not I should be able to find some other time,47,11,13:56:49
Erica Yee,"Speaking of, what do you think of meeting up after my nu sci meeting on Thursday? Think I'll be swamped with work until then unfortunately. We can do the Bible study and see each other before I'm away for the weekend",216,41,13:56:36
Erica Yee,Yeah that definitely makes sense. We can talk about both things in person haha,78,14,13:55:04
Ben Fickes,And I'd love to hear about your dating convo sometime too if it's stuff you're willing to share,95,18,13:48:15
Ben Fickes,"Thanks for letting me know, I'm glad there's another person reaching out to him. Idk how to explain this I can later in person but I'm worried about him but not worried for his immediate safety (if that makes sense, and except for yesterday but I think that was a miscommunication)",281,51,13:47:38
Erica Yee,Just wanted to let you know,27,6,13:38:11
Erica Yee,Basically I was kinda like I don't exactly how he's doing but I think he's going through some rough stuff. She said she was thinking of reaching out to him anyway before she left so she may,189,37,13:37:51
Erica Yee,Np! Have a good class,21,5,13:36:09
Ben Fickes,Gotta go for class Iâm not ignoring you I promise will respond later,70,13,13:35:58
Erica Yee,"And then she said Dan Hui has told her some stuff about John (but idk what and didn't ask), and she's meeting up with Dan on Thursday",133,27,13:35:48
Erica Yee,Also she asked if I knew how John is doing ð¶ð¶ cuz when they were both in iv worship they talked a good amount apparently,126,25,13:35:11
Erica Yee,Yah got a job at children's hospital of Philadelphia I believe,62,11,13:34:05
Erica Yee,"""so I just started dating this white boy""
""Erica no oh noooooo"" 
LOLOL. We've had a lot of conversation about interracial dating, especially because her parents are quite traditional Indian",189,30,13:33:46
Ben Fickes,Oh wait sheâs moving to philly? I had no idea. Iâm glad it was good!,72,15,13:32:39
Erica Yee,Lunch was really really good! So glad I got to catch up with her before she moves to philly,91,19,13:31:52
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,11:57:11
Ben Fickes,Hope your time at Marino goes well! And glad you got everything with homework figured out. And hope you enjoy your time at lunch :),131,25,11:03:12
Erica Yee,Hope you have a good run. Now I only have like 30 mins or even less to go to marino cuz I'm meeting Shreya for lunch at noon but that should be good,148,33,10:44:37
Erica Yee,But successfully figured out the python graphs and she helped me on the other homework (designing different types of studies) that was driving me crazy last night so I'm done with that assignment now!,200,34,10:42:37
Erica Yee,Sorry just spent almost an hour at research office hours because we both didn't catch my stupid mistake for so long lol,119,22,10:41:23
Ben Fickes,Iâm about to leave for a run but how are you doing?,53,12,9:43:36
Erica Yee,Yay I'm glad. And you're welcome :),35,7,9:43:04
Ben Fickes,"Thank you so much for all the support and checking in, you are amazing",70,14,9:05:31
Ben Fickes,"Iâm very good. Long story short but I got to talk to John a lot and I think heâs okay and the whole situation was a big misunderstanding. John, Thiago, and I all went to bed around the same time and talked while we fell asleep which was actually amazing (and I heard John telling Thiago about everything so thatâs good too). Anyways I think everything is okay",365,68,9:04:15
Erica Yee,How are you doing?,18,4,7:32:55
Ben Fickes,"Thanks Erica. John is back, heâs actually doing a devo now. He said heâs doing pretty well today actually. Anyways long story short I think everything is okay",162,28,23:03:37
Erica Yee,Good to hear. Please don't beat yourself up about overreacting or anything. I'm glad you were there for him no matter what,122,22,22:46:59
Ben Fickes,John is outside still on the phone with Erin. I donât think Iâll get to talk to him until later but assuming what John said in a brief convo is true I think there was a misunderstanding between them and John is not in any immediate danger (today or this week) of taking his own life,286,56,22:45:06
Erica Yee,KK thanks for letting me know. You're a good friend to him,58,12,22:30:18
Ben Fickes,Yeah Iâm just gonna go will talk more later but think things are okay,71,14,22:29:17
Ben Fickes,"Okay so John is laughing it off, heâs talking to Erin on the phone now",72,15,22:28:51
Erica Yee,"Dw about me, please just be there for him as I know you are",59,14,22:24:17
Ben Fickes,Sounds like Erin called the police. Sorry be back soon,54,10,22:23:05
Erica Yee,Omg,3,1,22:20:19
Ben Fickes,To my apartment. Theyâre talking to John now,46,8,22:20:09
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm in the laundry room and the police just showed up,60,12,22:19:57
Ben Fickes,So I donât think anything else is gonna happen - John seems âstableâ (idk how much he has going on but thatâs how he looks). He asked Thiago if he wanted anything from some store tomorrow so I think immediately heâs okay (and it was probably me overreacting to rush home but oh well). Anyways if youâre waiting up in case I call I think Iâll be okay so just wanted to let you know. Thanks once again for all the support,433,82,22:15:33
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,21:38:33
Ben Fickes,Sometime Iâd like to tell you the whole story but probably not tonight,72,13,21:37:59
Ben Fickes,Thanks Erica. I really appreciate it,36,6,21:37:32
Erica Yee,And you can call me anytime if you need to talk,47,11,21:37:17
Erica Yee,Ok glad to hear it. I'll be praying,35,8,21:36:43
Ben Fickes,Quick update from laundry room: Thiago and John are both home and cleaning already. John *seems* just fine. So I doubt weâll talk about anything but hopefully quality time helps,179,30,21:34:22
Erica Yee,Ok I'm coming,13,3,21:12:50
Ben Fickes,Iâm here we can meet wherever,31,6,21:12:06
Erica Yee,"Umm there are people in the living room and bedroom though, do you want to meet in the basement or?? Lol",104,21,21:10:28
Erica Yee,Oh sure now works,17,4,21:09:49
Ben Fickes,Sorry haha,10,2,21:08:54
Ben Fickes,Uh 3 minutes or later if youâre up,36,8,21:08:46
Erica Yee,Do you know what time ish,25,6,21:08:05
Erica Yee,Yep,3,1,21:08:01
Ben Fickes,Could I stop by later if thatâs alright? Something on my mind,63,12,20:44:46
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,19:24:39
Ben Fickes,HAHA I don't think I caught all the dialog that you did but there were definitely very witty parts I laughed it. And I did really like the story (and I did not complain or criticize stuff as far as I can remember which is exceptional for a romance movie haha),259,51,19:09:34
Erica Yee,I was kinda in the zone and couldn't see anyone else anyway haha,64,13,19:07:54
Erica Yee,Aw thanks! Hope you did too,27,6,19:07:37
Ben Fickes,Oh wow thanks for sharing that :) and Iâm glad you love it so much! It was nice hearing you laugh so much during it haha,122,26,19:02:51
Erica Yee,I love it haha,14,4,18:57:28
Erica Yee,"Btw I was thinking more about when you asked why I like the movie so much. I think every time I watch it, I just smile the whole time haha. It's just witty and gorgeous and sweet",178,37,18:57:25
Erica Yee,"BUT I'm pretty sure the protag in every one of her novels has at least one sister. Which is probably influenced by Austen's own family, cuz she had an older sister (Cassandra I believe) who she was super close too. Their surviving letters are a big reason we know so much about her life today",292,55,18:54:13
Erica Yee,Hmm not that I can remember specifically,40,7,18:51:54
Ben Fickes,Random thing about p&p I remembered in the shower: I like the things about sisterhood that were mentioned and Iâm curious if there was any more in the book. (As you might already know I really appreciate siblinghood in stories),229,40,18:42:47
Ben Fickes,By where we met last time,25,6,16:30:19
Ben Fickes,Yep!,4,1,16:29:54
Erica Yee,Going to bathroom but coming if you're still here!,50,9,16:27:23
Ben Fickes,Eh actually Iâll wait outside I can spare 6 minutes haha,58,11,16:24:17
Ben Fickes,*run,4,1,16:17:57
Ben Fickes,"Iâm leaving class now, Iâll swing by Forsyth in case you happen to get out early but otherwise Iâll just head back so I can rub before it gets too late",157,31,16:17:51
Ben Fickes,Class is getting out soon - if you happen to be done early do you wanna walk back?,82,18,16:05:25
Erica Yee,Kk,2,1,13:30:52
Ben Fickes,Green table between kigo and uburger,36,6,13:29:42
Erica Yee,"I'll meet you there, where exactly",34,6,13:29:20
Ben Fickes,Iâm in curry but can go wherever,34,7,13:29:08
Ben Fickes,Oh nice haha I just ate a Rebeccaâs sandwich,46,9,13:29:01
Erica Yee,Sweet tomatoes has sandwiches 30% off after 2 so that's gonna be lunch haha,75,14,13:28:33
Ben Fickes,Oh nice! You wanna work together?,33,6,13:28:25
Erica Yee,Staying,7,1,13:28:12
Ben Fickes,"Thanks! And yeah I was thinking about it, are you on campus or heading back?",76,15,13:26:53
Erica Yee,Are you staying on campus between classes?,42,7,13:25:53
Erica Yee,Class was good. Messed around with the GIS software which was kinda fun but also have no idea what I'm doing,108,21,13:24:41
Erica Yee,Oh yay!! Glad you could tell it,31,7,13:24:02
Ben Fickes,How was class?,14,3,13:15:11
Ben Fickes,"Thanks! It went well, I got to tell the prom one. Someone else was going to use it but I went first haha. Someone also used a variant of my backup one so good thing I didnât go last haha",188,40,13:15:07
Erica Yee,Lemme know how your joke goes!,30,6,11:41:17
Erica Yee,LOL,3,1,11:41:13
Ben Fickes,Wow I was JUST hearing about something like this! Crazy small world we live in,78,15,11:40:11
Erica Yee,"And then Daniella was like ""Ryan (her bf) and I are going to Disneyland! And it happens to be our 8 month anniversary. But I we have to skip GOC (campus ministry large group) to go, so I didn't want to put explicitly Disneyland in my calendar so everyone in GOC would see why were skipping. Only people who are really close to me will ask if they're curious"" HAHAHAHA",367,70,11:22:15
Erica Yee,That's my friend Daniella. So Tiffany asked in the group chat with the 3 of us what the :) means because it's so intriguing,123,24,11:20:36
Erica Yee,Do you see the huge green block on Friday with just the smiley face?,68,14,11:19:50
Erica Yee,Omg I want to share this funny story. Idk if I can explain it well enough but I gave you some context before so maybe it'll be ok,129,28,11:19:06
Ben Fickes,"That is interesting, glad it was a good reading haha",52,10,11:06:26
Erica Yee,So nice surprise I guess haha,29,6,11:05:24
Erica Yee,"The readings were actually really interesting, about how to approach ""big data"" thoughtfully and with context",109,16,11:05:18
Erica Yee,Ah ok,5,2,11:04:46
Ben Fickes,"Oh dang, Iâm sorry to hear that. Hopefully itâs a pretty chill day. Iâm good, happy to get this far in systems and a little tired haha",140,27,10:38:14
Erica Yee,You?,4,1,10:36:03
Erica Yee,It's been ok. Don't feel as rested as I would like even though I slept like 9 hours but oh well. Doing reading for my bostonography class now,141,28,10:36:02
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, me too :) howâs your morning been so far?",51,10,10:32:57
Erica Yee,Oh man okay. Glad you got that far though. And ofc!,51,11,10:15:58
Ben Fickes,Thanks for asking haha :),25,5,10:04:11
Ben Fickes,I still donât understand what went wrong though. Like I found the issue and fixed it but I still donât know why it was an issue to begin with,145,29,10:04:06
Ben Fickes,I thought I did - Iâm at ~80% right now. So I think Iâm going to submit this and then try to make it better but I wonât cry if I only get an 80 on this one,161,38,10:03:29
Erica Yee,Omg did you figure out systems?m,32,6,10:02:11
Ben Fickes,"HAHAHAHA oh my goodness thank you, I needed that haha. I guess if I move somewhere else with a disposal itâll really be a dream come true haha",144,28,9:38:11
Erica Yee,It was very satisfying,22,4,9:37:07
Erica Yee,"I don't remember any other part of this dream, and don't think you were even in it, but I dreamt your sink had a garbage disposal HAHA",134,27,9:36:59
Ben Fickes,"Thank you Erica, that really means a lot ð Iâve been very happy this past week too, thank you for that as well :)",118,24,9:24:38

Ben Fickes,"This may sound completely weird, but I was journaling and just wanted to say thank you for staying to wash dishes with me. It meant a lot and I just really enjoyed washing dishes with you ð",192,37,23:02:55

Ben Fickes,Iâm sure Josh will be disappointed we werenât wearing cowboy (cowpeople?) hats,82,12,1:03:21
Ben Fickes,I texted Jason and my mom and Josh about it haha and sent our pic,65,15,1:03:01
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð well hope you can tell them good things bout it. And haha well Iâm glad you have friends checking on you!,117,23,1:02:38
Erica Yee,"Actually when I checked my messages when I got home 3 different people were like ""are you okay you didn't respond to messages"" lmao",131,24,1:01:32
Erica Yee,Omg since I've talking to Sophie this whole time I didn't tell my friends from home how it our date went yet and theyre kinda freaking,134,26,1:00:37
Erica Yee,Yep kk,6,2,0:59:29
Ben Fickes,"Yeah that sounds great, thanks! Can I leave hw at my place since I assume weâre going there to cook or would you like me to bring it?",135,28,0:57:21

Ben Fickes,That would be absolutely amazing and I was secretly hoping you would ask because I have no lunch (and it looks really good haha),128,24,0:47:44
Erica Yee,Oh do you want beef stew for lunch?,35,8,0:47:09
Ben Fickes,Youâre welcome earlier too but I know thatâs what you had mentioned,71,12,0:40:10
Ben Fickes,"Thanks haha, I think I will :) what time do you want to come over tomorrow? I should be free whenever, if you wanted to come after lunch",136,28,0:39:54
Erica Yee,Ok sounds good about Sunday :) hopefully you'll enjoy it,56,10,0:39:10
Erica Yee,Oh nice,7,2,0:38:40

Ben Fickes,I am haha,9,3,0:38:01
Erica Yee,Sorry sorry are you still awake,31,6,0:37:42
Ben Fickes,"No Iâll hang out with p&p, especially since Iâm hosting and Iâd love to get to see this movie through your eyes (and also my own haha)",140,27,23:24:14
Erica Yee,If you want to go and eat cake and play games that's totally cool,65,14,23:23:25
Erica Yee,Ok just checked and you're invited on the FB event too for the dessert party,76,15,23:23:11
Erica Yee,Thank you!,10,2,23:22:44

Erica Yee,Also don't think I said but thanks for dressing up!! Looked nice :),67,13,23:21:44
Erica Yee,My eyes are bigger than yours,29,6,23:21:23
Ben Fickes,Oh oh oh haha gotcha. Dang rival events indeed,46,9,23:20:38

Ben Fickes,Wait no I didnât! And are you calling our date an IV event haha,65,14,23:19:51
Erica Yee,Not really IV but still,23,5,23:18:54
Erica Yee,Rival IV events lol,19,4,23:18:45
Erica Yee,But first did you see duschia's dessert party omg,49,9,23:18:36
Erica Yee,Yes,3,1,23:18:25

Ben Fickes,Awesome :),10,2,16:48:59
Erica Yee,yep! i'll be over,17,4,16:48:35
Ben Fickes,Class just got out so I might be ready around 5:30 if that works for you,72,16,16:48:16
Ben Fickes,Yeah I think so! :),19,5,11:09:05
Erica Yee,Ok cool xD hopefully we don't regret it but should be fine,58,12,11:07:55
Ben Fickes,I will wear tennis shoes too now haha,37,8,11:05:19
Ben Fickes,"Haha thanks for letting me know, I was actually heavily debating what pair of shoes Iâm going to wear so I appreciate the heads up very much",142,27,11:05:12
Erica Yee,You probably don't care but I just wanted to say that I think I'm going to wear tennis shoes tonight since we're walking so much and it's dry lol,145,29,10:56:31
Erica Yee,Sounds good xD,14,3,9:54:15
Ben Fickes,Oh also I have a Thiago story from last night for later haha,60,13,8:47:11
Ben Fickes,"Sounds good! My guess is Iâll be ready around 5:45, but if psych prof lets out early (it IS his birthday) I might be back sooner haha. And glad you got a break haha",166,34,8:41:00
Erica Yee,Also I'm texting rn cuz my Prof gave us our 10 min break already 20 mins into class lol,87,19,8:26:24
Erica Yee,Ooh fun,7,2,8:25:47
Erica Yee,Just lemme know when you're ready,33,6,8:25:33
Erica Yee,Your place? I keep forgetting to bring your blanket back so I will try to remember this time lol,96,19,8:25:27
Ben Fickes,Also random but I had a dream about Spider-Man last night haha,62,12,8:04:29
Ben Fickes,"Later today, do you want to meet up at my place or your place?",62,14,8:04:13
Ben Fickes,"Thanks, Iâm about to call her now! Respectfully I donât think Iâll tell my psych prof you say happy birthday haha",119,21,8:03:46
Erica Yee,Please tell your mom happy birthday day for me :) (and your psych prof lol),75,15,7:58:15
Ben Fickes,Yeah sounds good!,17,3,20:40:18
Erica Yee,We can talk about it tomorrow?,30,6,20:37:56
Erica Yee,"I've only done it in a slow cooker, just needs to cook for at least an hour",75,17,20:37:50
Ben Fickes,Idk how long it takes to cook chili in a slow cooker vs a pot,61,15,20:31:32
Ben Fickes,Oh at some point we should make a plan for the chili for Saturday,65,14,20:31:21
Erica Yee,Of course!,10,2,20:30:09
Ben Fickes,Thanks for listening to everything haha,39,6,20:29:48
Erica Yee,What a wild ride,16,4,20:29:35
Erica Yee,Omgggg,6,1,20:29:31
Ben Fickes,I also had to explain analog clocks for a homework assignment,61,11,20:23:28
Ben Fickes,"And Juan came in and said ""sorry I'm a little drunk"" which all the other kids started laughing and screaming at (Juan does not need the attention and it got them all in trouble)",177,34,20:23:06
Ben Fickes,"Oh it was worse actually, several kids wanted to read but they only had one book with them and started fighting over the book",125,24,20:21:47
Erica Yee,Did anyone want to read this time :P,36,8,20:21:04
Erica Yee,I'm sure they appreciate it still haha,38,7,20:20:59
Ben Fickes,Honestly I fell like I don't haha,33,7,20:16:53
Erica Yee,And HAHA well always good to learn I guess,42,9,20:15:30
Erica Yee,Oh man that's amazing you can keep up with them,47,10,20:14:44
Ben Fickes,And there was a food pyramid game put on by NU students where every single kid lost in the first round for answering that protein should be the largest portion of your plate,173,33,20:09:40
Ben Fickes,"They also kept talking about the âChinese symbolsâ on one of their Beyblades during snack (spoiler alert, it was Roman Numerals)",132,21,20:08:45
Ben Fickes,At one point they just started screaming and screeching as loudly as possible,77,13,20:07:58
Ben Fickes,It was good but very exhausting. I have no idea how those kids have so much energy after a day of school,104,22,20:07:39
Erica Yee,It was nice and short. How was volunteering?,44,8,20:01:56
Ben Fickes,"Haha nice, how was it? And yeah sure thing! The good news is we can always talk while we wait and this way we donât have a deadline to meet",141,30,20:00:16
Erica Yee,Maybe just try to get there a bit earlier,41,9,19:59:53
Erica Yee,"I would still be down to try, what do you think?",48,11,19:58:23
Erica Yee,Ohh interesting,15,2,19:54:50
Erica Yee,Just finished nu sci actually. It was early and short cuz the editor in chief is going to snowball lol,102,20,19:54:35
Ben Fickes,And it sounds like we might have to decide going in whether we want ramen or hot pot,84,18,19:52:44
Ben Fickes,"Soo they only take reservations for parties of 3 and up. They said the wait, if any, would probably be in the range of 15-30 minutes",132,26,19:52:05
Ben Fickes,Sounds perfect :) see you tomorrow then! Hope nu sci goes well!,63,12,19:45:38
Erica Yee,Hmm 8 would work?,17,4,19:44:56
Ben Fickes,Oh I forgot the time to get to max brenner so maybe push everything back by 15 mins?,84,18,19:29:15
Ben Fickes,"My personal thoughts would be, if we meet up around 5:30-5:45, and factor in enough time for us to just walk or sit on a bench and talk, maybe go with a later dinner, like either 7:30 or 8? Or if you would rather have more of a direct route and spend less time in the cold we could probably do 7 and still be pretty sure to arrive in time",338,71,19:24:00
Ben Fickes,Okay that sounds good to me :) let me finish eating and then Iâll make the reservation! What time do you think?,113,22,19:22:28
Erica Yee,I've been to friendly toast and dumpling house so down to try shabu & mein. But maybe we should try to make a rez if we're gonna walk all the way there? Haha,157,33,19:05:14
Erica Yee,Never been over the Longfellow bridge so that could be cool,59,11,19:03:29
Erica Yee,This looks possible,19,3,19:02:40
Erica Yee,Depending on how ambitious we are lol,37,7,19:00:47
Erica Yee,So that probably rules out places over 2ish miles away,54,10,19:00:36
Erica Yee,"Ok so for no rational reason, I feel like just walking",54,11,19:00:04
Ben Fickes,I'm good with anything! If you know a non-walking distance place or would like to not walk to any of these places I'm good with that,132,26,18:44:07
Erica Yee,Do you want to only go to walking distance places?,50,10,18:43:27
Erica Yee,Thanks,6,1,18:43:09
Erica Yee,Ooh thanka,10,2,18:43:06
Ben Fickes,And for hot chocolate Max Brenner seems good (plus it's near the Lindt store where they give you a free sample of chocolate so we could stop by there too haha),159,31,18:32:06
Ben Fickes,Places on Boylston,18,3,18:31:28
Ben Fickes,Friendly Toast (a little less far away than the others),55,10,18:31:19
Ben Fickes,Dumpling House (also a little far away),39,7,18:31:01
Ben Fickes,"Shabu & Mein (a little far away, in Cambridge)",46,9,18:30:38
Ben Fickes,oops did not mean to send,25,6,18:30:21
Ben Fickes,Okay dinner ideas:,18,3,18:30:14
Erica Yee,Awesome! To both,16,3,15:11:07
Ben Fickes,And I have dinner ideas for tomorrow Iâll tell you about later,64,12,15:08:10
Ben Fickes,"Before I forget, we can put Megan as our email contact for volunteering",71,13,15:07:57
Ben Fickes,Oh my goodness haha glad it doesnât affect you and the appointment was good. No problem!,90,16,15:07:43
Erica Yee,Thanks for praying and asking :),32,6,14:56:15
Erica Yee,"But doesn't affect me and appointment actually was completely fine. I'm on track and and can just apply to change my pattern of attendance so I can take classes both semesters, which should be approved",201,35,14:56:03
Erica Yee,Apparently the information science major is getting phased out LMAOOO,69,10,14:54:48
Ben Fickes,Thanks! Let me know how your meeting goes,41,8,14:12:46
Erica Yee,Thanks :) hope you have a good volunteering,43,8,13:44:13
Ben Fickes,Hope the meeting goes well! Iâll be praying for you,53,10,13:43:16
Ben Fickes,Np!,3,1,23:15:42
Erica Yee,2pm ð¬ thanks,15,3,23:14:32
Ben Fickes,"Yeah sleep well! And sure thing, I definitely well. What time is it? So I can ask how it went haha",98,21,23:13:45
Erica Yee,Please pray for my academic advisor appointment tomorrow. Idk even know what but that they would have favor I guess?? Lol,121,21,23:13:23
Erica Yee,Same and hopefully I'll actually get 9 hours tonight,52,9,23:12:51
Ben Fickes,Thanks haha. Iâm actually probably going to go to bed soon. If you wanna work at all in the evening before nu sci lemme know. If not Iâll see you on Friday :),162,33,23:10:35
Erica Yee,So funny omg,12,3,23:07:07
Erica Yee,LOLOL of course I have to look it up after that,47,11,23:07:03
Ben Fickes,Sometimes we would just go up to each other and say âRemember Galatians 5:12!â Sorry in advance if you look it up haha,122,23,23:00:33
Ben Fickes,This is probably more inappropriate but there was a Bible verse me and the other freshman guys would reference to each other freshmen year,138,24,22:59:42
Ben Fickes,"HAHA ð thatâs hilarious, thank you for sharing. And no worries I donât think thatâs inappropriate haha",111,17,22:58:46
Erica Yee,"So I looked up the Bible app's verse of the day again because I wanted to write it in my journal. And when I clicked on it, it went to the whole chapter and LOOK AT VERSE 11 LOL I'm dying right now",197,43,22:57:06
Erica Yee,Omgomgomg idk if this is inappropriate but I have to share,58,11,22:55:36
Ben Fickes,"No problem haha. Realize I didnât really answer your question, Ty had very little reaction haha",97,16,22:54:43
Erica Yee,ðð thanks for sharing,27,4,22:53:48
Ben Fickes,The story is actually a little longer haha. I was very vague at first and didnât reveal whom I was going on a date with (ooh mystery) but realized that at that point it was really dumb to not say anything so I told Ty after prayer time. (Plus after knowing Iâm going on a date itâs really not that hard to figure out itâs with you if you think about it and Iâm sure Ty wouldâve),390,77,22:49:33
Erica Yee,Wait did he say anything when you said the prayer request,57,11,22:47:24
Erica Yee,HAHA,4,1,22:47:14
Ben Fickes,Are we talking Friday or Sunday ð,36,7,22:43:13
Erica Yee,I want to hear his thoughts lol,31,7,22:42:33
Erica Yee,Omg can ty come,15,4,22:42:26
Ben Fickes,"Maybe I should invite Ty and Jason too haha. And wow hope you didnât start the advice 8 days ago haha. But yeah Iâm sure itâll be good, Iâll at least know you and Katie so no sweat whoever else comes",207,41,22:41:37
Erica Yee,Anyway yeah idk who else Katie is inviting but should be a good group,69,14,22:40:15
Erica Yee,"Although tonight we did talk about the rom com ""how to lose a guy in 10 days"" lol xD",84,19,22:39:50
Erica Yee,Omg I'm so sorry. They are not crashing :P,42,9,22:39:20
Ben Fickes,Sure thing! And okay good I was REALLY panicked for a second haha,65,13,22:38:16
Erica Yee,Wait I mean Sunday HAHAHA,25,5,22:37:51
Erica Yee,Maybe can use the fold out mattress for more seating??,54,10,22:37:47
Erica Yee,"Oh also Jenny said she's coming Friday and Abby said she is ""highly interested"" lol",83,15,22:37:27
Erica Yee,Haha looking forward to it,26,5,22:37:01
Ben Fickes,I have a funny story about Ty and Jason but Iâll share it in person because itâs hard to type out,101,21,22:36:05
Ben Fickes,Holy cow thatâs intense and amazing. Thatâs very brave of her and Iâm glad God is using her in such an amazing way. And Iâm glad you all got to share in that,165,33,22:35:33
Erica Yee,Ok no rush! Thanks for looking,30,6,22:34:48
Erica Yee,"Then when we were talking about how we each are doing, it was pretty normal sharing about different stressful things in our lives, etc. But then suddenly one girl is like ""oh I have more thing"" and tells this super intense story about being at a T station earlier and God telling her to talk to this guy sitting there. And turns out he was going to kill his co-worker earlier that day and had the knife still but then didn't. And she prayed for him and said it was God stopping him and then he asked where she goes to church because he feels led to go too ð®ð®",564,110,22:33:59
Ben Fickes,Iâll look into other places later/tomorrow. And glad it was good! That sounds delicious and Iâm glad I am not the only one out of the two of us who has the power to eat two plates haha,188,38,22:33:40
Erica Yee,"It was really good. Abby, Jenny, two other girls I know a bit from last year and then one who joined last semester so this was my first time meeting her. Abby cooked this super cheesy Alfredo chicken pasta and I ate two whole plates (are you proud of me)",254,50,22:30:49
Erica Yee,"Lol I feel honored, totally ok",30,6,22:29:32
Erica Yee,"If happy lamb is the one sorta near church on Mass Ave, then yeah I've been. It was pretty good",95,20,22:29:11
Ben Fickes,Oh wait forgot it was just catching up but how was it?,54,12,22:28:41
Ben Fickes,"Oh Iâm so sorry haha was it bad? Menâs group was good. We looked at Luke 2, with Simeon and Anna. And it was just Jason Ty and I and I talked about our date during prayer requests so Ty knows too (hope thatâs okay). How was your bible study?",247,50,22:28:23
Erica Yee,How was men's group?,20,4,22:25:49
Erica Yee,Ok let's not go there,21,5,22:25:44
Erica Yee,Oh man I've eaten there before,30,6,22:25:40
Ben Fickes,I looked up the hot pot place and it seems like good food. Downside is second search result is this article: https://boston.eater.com/2018/11/7/18056130/lawsuit-happy-lamb-hot-pot-wage-theft-violations-boston-area,213,22,21:46:38
Ben Fickes,ð,4,1,21:30:39
Erica Yee,Np. It was really good! Walking back now but will reply more later,66,13,21:30:22
Ben Fickes,How was enc?,12,3,20:42:40
Ben Fickes,I will look up spring shabu shabu but sounds like hot pot might be a better way to go (again Iâll check out other places too). Sorry for late reply btw I was at menâs group,176,36,20:42:27
Erica Yee,and i don't think it's worth trying to get a table during peak time on a friday,79,17,19:01:22
Erica Yee,sophie highly recommends this place called spring shabu shabu but it's quite far away in allston,96,16,19:00:15
Erica Yee,ooh i do like hot pot,21,6,18:59:51
Ben Fickes,"Speaking of Friday, I was thinking we could get dinner somewhere in Cambridge (since weâll be closer there than we normally would be on campus). Iâll look at more places later but how would you feel about hot pot?",217,39,18:51:28
Ben Fickes,HAHA ð am I not the most mysterious and intriguing man ever? Thanks for sharing that haha,92,17,18:50:35
Erica Yee,LOLOL,5,1,18:48:14
Erica Yee,"both sophie and barbara were in the room. and then i randomly bring up ""so ben and i are going on a date on friday."" and then i guess sophie didn't hear the first part so she's like ""wow you go girl! is it with a mystery man?""",226,48,18:48:13
Erica Yee,omg to answer your snap:,24,5,18:47:16
Erica Yee,Yeah sure haha,14,3,18:44:17
Ben Fickes,Also I think we actually did 4 hours right? 9-1?,48,10,18:42:09
Ben Fickes,"Oh no Iâll email her now, thanks for the reminder",51,10,18:41:55
Erica Yee,Did you get a chance to ask Megan if we can put her email for volunteering yet?,79,17,18:41:24
Erica Yee,"I'm right inside where uhcs entrance is, lemme know when you're here",68,12,16:39:14
Erica Yee,Coming to your apt door,23,5,13:46:14
Ben Fickes,And I saw that too!!! Was gonna tell you about it but was hoping youâd see it on your own haha,96,21,13:23:36
Ben Fickes,Okay Iâm still unloading groceries so Iâll probably wait til you arrive,75,12,13:23:09
Erica Yee,Thanks xD,9,2,13:22:55
Erica Yee,Uh whatever's easier for you,28,5,13:22:14
Ben Fickes,Do you want me to have it ready for when you arrive? Or cook while youâre here?,81,17,13:21:28
Ben Fickes,No worries haha take your time,30,6,13:21:15
Erica Yee,Think it will be more like 145/150 sorry,40,8,13:20:18
Ben Fickes,Awesome thank you,17,3,12:15:34
Erica Yee,Yeah chili powder,17,3,12:15:22
Ben Fickes,Do you happen to have chili powder or cayenne pepper?,53,10,12:13:30
Ben Fickes,Np!,3,1,10:55:08
Erica Yee,Thanks!,7,1,10:53:38
Ben Fickes,"Okay sounds good! And oh thatâs right, hope you enjoy it :)",61,12,10:51:12
Erica Yee,I am going to the ENC dinner tonight so gotta do some work before that,70,15,10:50:16
Erica Yee,Haha ok. After class would probably be best for me. I can just pick them up and then let you call Josh,102,22,10:49:56
Ben Fickes,Or like you said before class,29,6,10:37:37
Ben Fickes,"I was planning on going back to my apartment. I told Josh Iâd call him after class but last time he could only talk for an hour. So you could come over after that, or in the evening, or after class and you could say hi to Josh haha",233,49,10:37:19
Erica Yee,"Maybe I can just get my stuff and meet at your apartment for lunch, then bring the groceries back before or after class depending on time",137,26,10:01:59
Erica Yee,Yes this would be really helpful. Umm were you planning on going back to your apt after class?,94,18,9:59:33
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! And yeah I know you mentioned that so I was thinking it could save you the time of cooking. Do you want me to cook it and bring it over when I bring the groceries? Or I could cook at your place if thereâs room,228,48,9:51:41
Erica Yee,I do have to do my reading during lunch though if you don't mind,64,14,9:45:34
Erica Yee,Thank you so much :),20,5,9:44:56
Erica Yee,Oh! I would love that for lunch,31,7,9:44:47
Ben Fickes,"I know youâre at volunteering but I wanted to let you know I have some leftover sautÃ©ed veggies from dinner last night that I *think* should be enough for two portions, if you donât feel like cooking either lunch or dinner and want quesadillas. But no worries if you have other meal plans",293,53,9:37:19
Erica Yee,Ooh that sounds good,20,4,8:07:28
Ben Fickes,It's from the internet but I count it as my mom's haha,54,12,23:31:37
Ben Fickes,Please sleep and ignore this because I know you have an early morning and this is not urgent but for potluck I'm thinking my mom's chili recipe haha,148,28,23:31:25
Ben Fickes,See you then!,13,3,23:24:23
Erica Yee,Yay :) see you tomorrow,23,5,23:24:12
Ben Fickes,Yeah sure thing! If I get a late start Iâll let you know but that should work!,80,17,23:23:33
Erica Yee,I should be home by 130ish if that works for you?,49,11,23:23:04
Ben Fickes,Oh dang well good luck! Do you want me to bring you your groceries after volunteering or after class? Or in the evening I guess. And okay Iâll try to muster up a recipe haha,175,35,23:17:49
Erica Yee,1) didn't even think about what to bring 2) I am def down to make something together 3) have no ideas lol,105,22,23:15:31
Erica Yee,Absolutely did not do the reading that I have a quiz tomorrow but think I can do it after volunteering lol,106,21,23:14:35
Erica Yee,I'm here,8,2,23:13:49
Ben Fickes,No problem! Know youâre probably asleep but one more thing I thought of: I want to get something for Joshuaâs potluck but idk what. Do you want to make something together and both bring it? Or if not if you happen to have any ideas theyâd be appreciated (no worries if you donât though just wanted to ask),313,58,23:12:03
Erica Yee,"emailed list, really appreciate this again!",43,6,23:05:45
Erica Yee,i mean they still should've responded to your email,51,9,22:53:06
Erica Yee,oh whaaa,8,2,22:52:53
Ben Fickes,Also just as a heads up Iâm walking back so wonât reply for a bit. Also because I need to vent I found out my group assignment is actually not due for a while (these are recommended guidelines not deadlines) and so now I feel terrible for panicking at my team,263,51,22:50:29
Ben Fickes,No worries haha I went to the gym to be strong enough to lift groceries,71,15,22:48:44
Erica Yee,but i know you have to shop for yourself too,44,10,22:48:29
Erica Yee,not that i'm questioning your masculinity lol,45,7,22:48:22
Erica Yee,ok so beef stew is gonna be a lot of heavy ingredients sorry,60,13,22:45:14

Erica Yee,awesome thanks so much,22,4,22:41:39
Erica Yee,oh! lemme make it now,21,5,22:41:32
Ben Fickes,"OH sure thing, I can host! Iâll check with John and Thiago when I see them but it should be fine",98,21,22:41:03
Erica Yee,"because now that it's more people, and she only has a bed in midtown xD",71,15,22:40:29
Erica Yee,oh i think she wants to ask if you want to host lol,51,13,22:40:07
Ben Fickes,Also I know youâre probably sleeping soon but if youâd still like to send a shopping list now or in the morning I can shop for stuff,136,27,22:38:37
Ben Fickes,Okay haha well Iâd love to come then! Thanks for the invite,61,12,22:38:00
Erica Yee,not sure what throw down means but cool,39,8,22:37:22
Erica Yee,"and this was actually suppoed to be us + jenny but katie is now like ""even if jenny can't make it we could also invite others and throw down""",141,29,22:37:18
Erica Yee,you def do not need to read the book lol,40,10,22:36:41
Erica Yee,thanks!,7,1,22:36:05
Ben Fickes,I have seen it! Pretty sure we talked about it super briefly. And yeah of course! Iâd love to come if you donât mind (unless you strongly think I should read the book first or Iâd be third wheeling your time with Katie haha),230,44,22:32:59
Erica Yee,ðð,8,1,22:31:13
Erica Yee,"katie: ""Ben is invited too if he would like. haha, i see him enjoying it!""",74,15,22:31:05

Erica Yee,Oh thanks for asking. Haha it would've been ok but I appreciate your consideration,82,14,21:36:04
Ben Fickes,Howâs your foot? Wanted to ask but didnât know if you wanted me to bring it up to everyone hah,98,20,21:15:26
Erica Yee,ð,4,1,20:31:30
Ben Fickes,"Yeah thatâd probably be the best way. Iâd love to talk to you after if you end up talking to her. And HAHA Iâm glad, I wouldâve thought you were dreading coming otherwise",178,33,20:25:31

Ben Fickes,And haha sorry Erica hope you can get through it,48,10,20:21:23

Erica Yee,(which is why i'm only half paying attention),45,8,20:21:04

Erica Yee,bathroom at a restaurant we were at* LOL,40,8,16:54:53
Erica Yee,"she's the first one i texted about it in new york and then we didn't have any time alone over break so didn't talk about it in person except when a different friend went to the bathroom we were at and i was very quickly like ""soooo i think it's still there"" and she responded ""girl i think you should go for it"" and then our friend came back",341,69,16:54:41
Ben Fickes,Is she one of the friends you talked to over break?,51,11,16:50:56
Erica Yee,i know right xD,15,4,16:49:30
Ben Fickes,"HAHAHA oh my goodness that's hilarious, trying not to smile too conspicuously in class haha. To be fair since Barbs was late and Kristy took the chair we had no choice but to sit next to each other (what a shame)",212,41,16:46:02
Erica Yee,"so barbara put it on her ig story, which some of my friends from home follow (she' visited california a few summers ago and met most of my close friends). so one of my friends messages me this LOLOL",198,39,16:39:06
Erica Yee,that's great!!,14,2,16:37:52

Erica Yee,Oh yeah tomorrow is perfect. Thank you so much!!,48,9,13:57:05
Ben Fickes,HAHA well I can't make it to the store today (or at least until tonight) but I can go tomorrow if it'd be helpful,113,24,13:55:53
Erica Yee,"So yesterday I was very touched by your offer but there was no way I'd ask you to do that for me. Today, however, is a different story lol..",140,29,13:50:04
Ben Fickes,And I know you're not bedridden but wanted to offer haha,56,11,13:45:18
Ben Fickes,Not for Friday haha,19,4,13:44:59
Ben Fickes,Okay sounds good :) would you like me to get groceries for you sometime then? With your foot hurting?,101,19,13:44:51
Erica Yee,Let's definitely do something else,34,5,13:44:21
Erica Yee,Yeah I'm trying to ice it which is somewhat helping. Just need to budget more time for walking everywhere,105,19,13:44:09
Ben Fickes,Holy cow are you alright? And no worries haha we can ice skate another time. You want to do something else Friday then?,119,23,13:40:15
Erica Yee,Apparently I have bad balance just walking normally too lmao,60,10,13:39:17
Erica Yee,"It's fine, I can basically walk still, but probably won't be all better by Friday :/ I'm so sorry",97,19,13:38:03
Erica Yee,Think I low-key twisted my ankle when I slipped and fell on ice,63,13,13:37:32
Erica Yee,"Speaking of ice skating, I have some unfortunate news lol",57,10,13:36:40
Erica Yee,Oh nice!,8,2,13:36:27
Ben Fickes,Hope your work is going well!,29,6,13:36:03
Ben Fickes,Sorry for the late reply completely underestimated how long gym would take and was late to class (but I was one of four people so I honestly didnât need to be there). It was good catching up with Danny! We ate after. He brought up that he wants to go ice skating with me sometime haha,286,56,13:35:57
Erica Yee,How was hanging with Danny? You guys went to the gym right?,59,12,11:13:41
Erica Yee,Now just have to do the assignments due at 4pm and 5:30 whee,60,13,11:13:29
Ben Fickes,Wow haha no idea how thatâs more enjoyable than the musical but to each their own. And good glad I could help you be more efficient ð howâs the workload now?,164,31,11:01:24
Erica Yee,ALSO good thing I didn't do much of the readings after all cuz we did not need it for this class AT ALL lol,107,24,9:57:32
Erica Yee,Lol ok good for you xD,22,6,9:43:23
Erica Yee,"Journalism professor as we talk about Adams/Jefferson: ""I didn't see Hamilton because I hate musicals and would never pay to see them, but I did listen to the WHOLE audio version of chernow's book""",197,34,9:43:17
Ben Fickes,Okay haha sounds good! Looking forward to your story too,56,10,9:01:14

Ben Fickes,"Also hope your 8 am is going well, and I have a funny story to tell you sometime about a convo I had with John last night involving Thiago",138,29,8:30:24
Ben Fickes,Sorry I know youâve mentioned this before but what is ENC? Is it an Alethia community group? And yeah you can always play it by ear but *hopefully* work will be a little calmer by then?,187,36,8:29:39
Erica Yee,"Hmm even though I have a lot to do, I still need to eat I guess haha. And it'll good to catch up with those friends",115,26,7:24:45
Erica Yee,Urgh trying to decide whether to go to ENC tomorrow. It's dinner at Jenny's apartment which is 20 min walk away,111,21,7:24:00
Erica Yee,You're welcome :P,17,3,6:59:32
Ben Fickes,Thank you Erica ð I was gonna text you saying thanks for all the good convo today (but figured youâd be asleep haha). I really appreciate time talking with you about anything but especially this (and donât know how to say this exactly but you are very understanding toward my awkwardness haha). So thank you as well ð and it means a lot to hear all of that. Goodnight and I hope you sleep well :),406,76,22:41:39
Erica Yee,(probably sleeping before you reply so goodnight!),50,7,22:39:04
Erica Yee,I realize I didn't explicitly say this so thank you thank you for having us talk about us tonight even when I was doing my reading. I'm really glad we laid everything out tonight and got to talk more in the basement lol. Completely worth the time and energy spent :),266,51,22:38:48

Erica Yee,No worries!,11,2,22:33:06
Ben Fickes,Yeah sorry did not mean to minimize that,40,8,22:31:08
Erica Yee,Ultimately good but oh so challenging yep,41,7,22:28:18
Ben Fickes,Gotcha. Well I guess dependent on spiritual health is a good situation to be in haha,84,16,22:26:37
Erica Yee,"Hmm kinda? But also trying not to measure ""success"" by the number of events we have or how many people we draw. Think this semester we're gonna really try to make sure we in the right place spiritually as leaders and a team in order to be able to lead others in worship",269,53,22:23:34
Ben Fickes,Oh thatâs good that you got to hear about them. Do you feel hopeful about it?,79,16,21:36:06
Erica Yee,it was pretty good actually. was able to hear about some of the challenges last semester,88,16,21:30:35
Ben Fickes,I will haha. Glad you made the trip safely :) have a good worship meeting!,74,15,19:06:07

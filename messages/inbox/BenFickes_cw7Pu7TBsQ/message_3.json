Then there was a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdance\u00e2\u0080\u009d for all the children staying at the hotel that I got a ride to. And I invited you but you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come (being in California haha). But it was outside and there were fireworks and the only thing I remember from that part was some guy started playing the violin as the fireworks started and everyone went crazy at the coincidence. Then at the end I offered several people a ride to the hotel. But alas, I remembered at the end I had gotten a ride there and had no car. So I called my parents (they were both in the dream) and asked for them to bring the car. And I was very embarrassed at offering a ride without a car but eventually they brought it. Afterwards, my mom saw how embarrassed I was and called you and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cErica, Ben is sad. You need to come over here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So you suddenly appeared (of course) but your hand was in a cast because it was burned and you had severe sunburn haha. Anyways I was trying to hold your hand but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t because of the cast (why did I try if you very clearly had a cast? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know) so I held your wrist instead haha. Then my family and you were at a movie theater and there was popcorn labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cfemale\u00e2\u0080\u009d that you and my mom got and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmale\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Josh and I got. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the end haha",

This week I get several emails from the provider with a new bill for unreturned equipment. Apparently s and c both thought the other had done it but neither actually did it. So now I have an outstanding bill!! Barbara's going to email the housing director to see if they put it somewhere but I highly doubt it.

They are usually very confident and smooth talking (hope this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t me projecting faults onto more confident guys haha). Between you and me only Matt read a pickup artist book to try to get a girlfriend and it was honestly disgusting. But anyways my guess regardless of all of this is that he is interested in her (idk if in a relationship or just sex). So he probably is not thinking of this as just friendship. And even if Kristy keeps it as \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust friends\u00e2\u0080\u009d he will likely still want more (just assuming based on other guys). So idk how much she knows him.

So I asked him if the ratio was something he looked for in a group and I don't remember his exact response but I don't think it was a clear yes or no. He said later \"if I were sitting here with two guys who were white, I would probably not talk. If they were Asian, I would feel threatened.\" And at some point he mentioned feeling threatened by guys again and he said immediately after it \"even meeting with you... was a stretch.\" (Does he feel threatened by me???) So I tried to ask him what he meant by threatened and he said \"It just makes me think of what life could have been like if I had been in other activities besides Cru.\" Then he said not to get to hung up on the word \"threatened.\" I asked him more about it and he mentioned particularly being in IV instead of Cru (then he said the stuff about IV being cliquey, if I remember correctly).

Sometime around then he talked about his paranoia about things. I talked very briefly about my dad and Josh's struggle to believe his friends loved him.

Maybe I misheard some stuff but I was kinda confused. Anyways I kept asking him more about it and he answered so oh well haha. He said he was lacking motivation and I asked him about it and he said that stemmed from lack of optimism about her saying yes. He said she doesn't have FB so he only sees her in person and doesn't message her. I asked him about getting to know her as a friend and he said (at separate points)  something like \"you shouldn't do that if you like someone\" (which I can see some logic to) and \"I don't have the patience for that\" (which honestly seems like a red flag to me). Then at some point he said \"I've never felt like I could be single and not have a crush\" (which seems like an important revelation to me even though he said it casually).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# get data
library(rvest)

message_3 <- read_html("C:/Users/eeyus/GitHub/anniversary1/messages/inbox/BenFickes_cw7Pu7TBsQ/message_3.html")
```


```{r}
# create dataframe for results
df = data.frame(name = character(),time = character())

```

```{r}
# save data to df
message_block <- html_nodes(div, ".uiBoxWhite")
times <- html_nodes(blocks, xpath='//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "_2lem", " " ))]')
names <- html_nodes(blocks, xpath='//*[contains(concat( " ", @class, " " ), concat( " ", "_2lel", " " ))]')

df = data.frame(
  times,
  names
)

```
